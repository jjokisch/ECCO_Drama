<head>SCENE I. <stage><hi>A Garden.</hi></stage></head>
<stage>Mr. Waller, Mrs. Waller.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Waller.</speaker>
<p>YONDER is our Valentine walking in the garden with a book in his hand. I am very much afraid that it is rather through vanity than from a real desire of improving himself, that he always appears to be busy reading.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>What makes you think so, my dear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="122" facs="126"/>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>Do not you remark that he casts a side-look now and then, to see if any body takes notice of him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>And yet his masters give a very flattering account of his diligence, and all agree that he is very far advanced for his age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>That is true. But if my suspicions are right, and if the little that he can know has made him vain, I would rather a hundred times that he knew nothing, and were modest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>That he knew nothing?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my dear. A man without any great extent of knowledge, but upright, modest and industrious, is a much more estimable member of society than a learned man whose studies have turned his head and puffed up his heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>I cannot think that my son is of that description.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>Heaven forbid! But while we are here in the country I shall have more opportunities of observing him; and I am resolved to take the advantage of the first that shall offer, to clear up my doubts. I see him coming towards us. Leave me alone with him a moment.</p>
</sp>

<head>SCENE II.</head>
<stage>Mr. Waller, Valentine.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Val. </speaker>
<stage>(to Michael, whom he pushes back.)</stage>
<p>No; leave me. Papa, it is that little fool of a country boy that comes always to interrupt me in my reading.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>Why do you call that good-natured child a little fool?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Why, he knows nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>Of what you have learnt, I grant you; but then he knows many things which you do not, and you may both inform each other a good deal, if you will communicate what you know, one to the other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>He may learn a good deal of me, but what can I learn from him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>If ever you should have a farm, do you think that it would be of no service to you to have an early notion of the labours of the country, to learn to distinguish trees and plants, to know the times of sowing and harvest, and to study the wonders of vegetation? Michael possesses these different parts of knowledge, and desires no better than to share them with you. They will perhaps be one day of the greatest use to you. Those, on the contrary, that you could communicate,
<pb n="124" facs="128"/>would be of no service to him. So that you see, in this intercourse, all the advantage is on your side.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Well, but papa, would it become me to learn any thing from a little country boy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>Why not, if he is capable of instructing you? I know no real distinction amongst men, but that of useful talents and good manners; and you must own that in both these points, he has equally the advantage over you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>What, in good manners too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>In every station, they consist in treating all persons as our duty prescribes to us. He does so, in shewing a particular attachment and complaisance to you. Do you do the same? do you make a return of mildness and good will? And yet he seems to merit them. He is active and intelligent. I believe him to be possest of good-nature, spirit, and good sense. You ought to think yourself very happy in having so amiable a companion, with whom you may at once amuse and improve yourself. His father is my foster-brother, and has always had a remarkable affection for me. I am pretty sure that Michael has the same for you. See how the poor little fellow hangs about the terrace-walk to meet you. Take care and use
<pb n="125" facs="129"/>him with civility. There is more honour and integrity in his father's cottage than in many palaces. His family too has been our tenants for some generations, and I should be glad to see he connexion continued between our children. <stage>(He goes out.)</stage></p>
</sp>
</div2>
<div2 n="3" type="scene">
<head>SCENE III.</head>
<sp>
<speaker>Valentine, </speaker>
<stage>(alone.)</stage>
<p>Yes, a fine connexion indeed! I think papa is joking. This little country boy teach me any thing! No; I will surprize him now so much with my learning, that he will not think of talking to me of his own, I'll warrant him.</p>
</sp>
</div2>
<div2 n="4" type="scene">
<head>SCENE IV.</head>
<stage>Valentine, Michael.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>You won't have my little nosegay, then, Master Valentine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Nosegay? Psha! neither ranunculus nor tulip.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Why, it is true, they are only field flowers, but they are pretty, and I thought you might like to know them by their names.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>A great matter, indeed, to know the
<pb n="126" facs="130"/>names of your herbs. You may carry them where you found them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Well now, if I had known that, I would not have taken the trouble to gather them. I was resolved not to go home yesterday evening without bringing you something, and as I came back from work, tho' it was rather late, and I had a great mind for my supper, I stopped in our close, to gather them by the light of the moon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>You talk of the moon! Do you know how big it is?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Heh! Fegs! as big as a cheese.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Ignorant little clown! <stage>(Struts with an air of importance, while Michael stands staring at him.)</stage> Look here
<stage>(shewing him his book.)</stage> This is Telemaque. Have you ever read it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>This is not the catechism: our schoolmaster never talked to me about that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>No it is none of your country books.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Nay, how should I have read it then? But let us see it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Do not think of touching it with your dirty hands! <stage>(holding one of them up.)</stage> Where did you buy these tanned leather gloves?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Anan! it is my hand, Master Valentine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="127" facs="131"/>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>The skin is so hard, that one might cut it into shoe soles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>It is not with idleness that they are grown so hard. You know how to talk very well, I dare say, and yet I would not change conditions with you. To work honestly, and offend nobody, is all that I know, and it would be no harm if you knew as much. Good bye, Sir.</p>

<head>SCENE V.</head>
<sp>
<speaker>Valentine, </speaker>
<stage>(alone.)</stage>
<p>I think the little clown had a mind to make game of me. But I see company coming on the terrace-walk. I must put on a studious air before them. <stage>(He sits down, seeming to read in his book with great attention.)</stage></p>

<stage>Mr. and Mrs. Waller, Mr. Ray, and Mr. Nash.</stage>
<stage>Valentine, (seated on a bench on one side.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Wal.</speaker>
<p>What a fine evening! Would you chuse, gentlemen, to take a walk up this slope, to see the sun setting?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Ray.</speaker>
<p>I was going to mention it. The
<pb n="128" facs="132"/>weather is delicious, and the sky perfectly without a cloud in the west</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nash.</speaker>
<p>I shall be sorry to go from the nightingale. Do you hear his charming melody, madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Wal.</speaker>
<p>I was taken up with thinking. My heart was filled with pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Ray.</speaker>
<p>How can one live in town during this charming weather?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Wal.</speaker>
<p>Valentine, will you walk up the slope with us, to see the sun setting?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>No, I thank you, papa. I am reading something here that gives me more pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Wal.</speaker>
<p>If you speak truth, I pity you, and if you do not—Come, gentlemen, there is not a moment to lose. Let us continue our walk. <stage>(They walk forward up the hill.)</stage></p>
</sp>
</div2>
<div2 n="7" type="scene">
<head>SCENE VII.</head>
<sp>
<speaker>Valentine, </speaker>
<stage>(seeing them at a good distance.)</stage>
<p>There, they are almost out of sight: I need not be under any constraint now. <stage>(Puts the book into his pocket)</stage> What an opinion will these gentlemen have of my diligence! I should like to be a bird and fly after them, to hear the praises that they are giving me. <stage><hi>(Saunters about, yawning and listless, for near
<pb n="129" facs="133"/>a quarter of an hour.)</hi></stage> I am tired, after all, of being here alone. I can do better! The sun is set now, and I hear the company returning. I will slip into the wood, and hide myself in it so, that they shall scarcely find me. Mama will send all the servants to look for me with lights. They will talk of nothing but me all the evening, and will compare me with those great philosophers that have been known to go astray in their learned meditations, and to lose themselves in woods. My adventure will make a fine noise! Now for it. <stage>(He goes into the wood.)</stage></p>
</sp>

<div2 n="8" type="scene">
<head>SCENE VIII.</head>
<stage>Mr. and Mrs. Waller, Mr. Ray, Mr. Nash.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Ray.</speaker>
<p>I never saw weather more pleasing, nor a more charming scene.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Wal.</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen, my pleasure has been doubled by my enjoying it in your company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nash.</speaker>
<p>The nightingale too still continues his song. His voice seems even to grow more tender as night comes on. I am sorry that Mrs. Waller does not seem to listen to it with as much pleasure as before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>It is because I am anxious about my son. I do not see him the garden. <stage><hi>(She
<pb n="130" facs="134"/>calls him.)</hi></stage> Valentine! He does not answer! <stage>(Perceiving the gardener, she calls him)</stage> Martin, have you seen my son?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Martin.</speaker>
<p>Yes, madam, about ten minutes ago I saw him turn towards the grove.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>Towards the grove? Bless me; if he should lose himself! Pray run after him, and bring him in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Martin.</speaker>
<p>Yes, madam. <stage>(Goes out.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Waller, won't you go along with him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>No, my dear, I am not uneasy, for my part, Martin will be able to find him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>But if he should take a different way? I am frightened out of my wits!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr Nash.</speaker>
<p>Make yourself easy, madam. Mr. Ray and I will take the two sides of the wood, while the gardener shall take the middle. We cannot fail of finding him so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>Ah! gentlemen, I did not dare to ask it of you; but you know the feelings of a mother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen, do not give yourselves so much trouble, I'd rather you would not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Ray.</speaker>
<p>You will not take it amiss that we comply with Mrs. Waller's request rather than your's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="131" facs="135"/>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>I must confess it is against my inclination.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nash.</speaker>
<p>We will receive your reproaches at our return. <stage>(They walk towards the grove.)</stage></p>
</sp>
</div2>
<div2 n="9" type="scene">
<head>SCENE IX.</head>
<stage>Mr. and Mrs. Waller.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>Why, my dear, whence comes this indifference about your son?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>Do you think, my dear, that I love him less than you do? No, but I know better how to love him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs W.</speaker>
<p>And what if he could not be found?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>I should be very glad of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs W.</speaker>
<p>What, that he should pass the night in a gloomy wood? What would become of the poor child? and what would become of me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>You would both be cured. He of his vanity, and you of your injudicious fondness which keeps it up in him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean, my dear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>I am just now convinced of what I only suspected in the morning. The boy's head is filled with excessive vanity, and all his reading is but ostentation. He has only
<pb n="132" facs="136"/>lost himself on purpose to make us look for him, and to appear absent and forgetful through intense study. It gives me more pain that his mind should wander from a right way of thinking than if his steps really went astray. He will be unhappy all his life if he is not cured of it in time, and there is nothing but a wholesome humiliation that can save him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>But do you consider—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>Yes, every thing. He is eleven years old. If he can profit any thing by his natural sense or his learning, the light of the moon and the direction of the wind may guide him sufficiently to clear the wood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>But if he has not that thought?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>He will then better see the necessity of profiting by the lessons that I have given him upon this subject. Besides, we intend him for the army, and in that profession he will have many nights to pass without shelter. He will know what it is, and not go to a camp quite raw, to be laughed at by his companions. Then the air is not very cold at this season of the year, and for one night he will not die with hunger. Since by his folly he has brought himself into a scrape, let him get out of it again, or suffer the disagreeable consequences of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>No; I cannot agree to it; and
<pb n="133" facs="137"/>if you don't send people after him, I will go myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>Well, my dear, I will make you easy, though I am sorry that you will not let me follow my plan, as I intended. I shall tell litle Michael to join him as it were by chance. Colin too shall be at a small distance, in order to run to them in case of an accident. For any thing more, do not ask it; I have taken my resolution, and do not chuse, by a blind weakness, to deprive my son of a lesson that may be of service to him. Here are our friends coming back with Martin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>O heavens! I see, and they have not found him.</p>

<p>Tell me, my little wise man, how big may the moon be just now?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Nay, spare me, I beg of you, and guide me out of this wood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>You see then, master, that one may be a dirty little country boy, and yet be good for something. What would you give to know your way, instead of knowing how big the moon is?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I own my fault, and I promise never to shew any pride for the future.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Well, that is clever. But this same repenting by necessity may only hang by a thread. It is not amiss that a young gentleman should see what it is to look upon a poor man's son like a dog, and play with him according to his fancy. But to shew you that an honest clown does not bear malice, I will pass the night with you, as I have passed many a one with our sheep on the downs. To-morrow morning early I will take you

<p>I dare say I can help you there too. See, here are some potatoes. Dress them, as you know how.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Why they are raw.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>It is only to boil or roast them. Make a fire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>We want a light to kindle one; and then where shall we find coal or wood?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich. </speaker>
<stage>(smiling.)</stage>
<p>Why, cannot you find all that in your books?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="137" facs="141"/>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Oh! no, my dear Michael.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Well, then, I'll shew you that I know more than you and all your Tellymacks. <stage>(Takes a tinder-box, with flint and steel out of his pocket.)</stage> Crack! there is fire already; now you shall see. <stage>(He gathers a handful of dry leaves, and putting them round the tinder, fans with his hand until they take fire.)</stage> We shall soon have a blazing hearth. <stage>(He puts bits of dry wood upon the lighted leaves.)</stage> Do you see? <stage>(lays the potatoes close to the fire, and sprinkles them with dust.)</stage> This must serve, instead of ashes, to hinder them from burning. <stage>(Having laid them properly, and covered them once more with dust, he turns the fire over them, then adds fresh wood, and blows it up with his breath.)</stage> Have you a finer fire in your papa's kitchen? Come, now they will soon be done.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>O my good friend, what return can I make to your kindness?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Return? Pooh! when one does good, it pays itself. But stop a moment. While the potatoes are roasting I will fetch some hay for you. I saw a good deal lying in one part of the wood. You will sleep upon that like a prince. But take care of the roast while I am away. <stage>(Goes out singing.)</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Valentine.</speaker>
<p>Fool that I was! how could I be so unjust as to despise this child. What am I, compared to him? how little I am in my own eyes, when I examine his behaviour and mine! but it shall never happen again. Henceforward I will not despise those of a lower condition than myself. I will not be so proud, nor so vain. <stage>(He walks about, and gathers up dry sticks for the fire.)</stage></p>

<head>SCENE XIV.</head>
<stage><hi>Valentine, Michael, (hauling in a large bundle of hay.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Here is your bed of down, your coverlid and all. I will make you a bed now quite soft.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I thank you, my friend. I would help you, but I do not know how to set about it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>I don't want you. I can do it all alone. Go warm yourself. <stage>(He unties the bundle, sprends part of it on the ground, and reserves the rest for a covering.)</stage> That is finished. Now let us think of supper. <stage>(Takes a potatoe from the fire, and tastes it)</stage> They are
<pb n="139" facs="143"/>done. Eat them while they are warm, they are better so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>What, won't you eat some with me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>No, thank you. There is just enough for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>How? Do you think?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>You are too kind. I won't touch them. I am not hungry. Besides, I shall have as much pleasure in seeing you eat them. Are they good?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Excellent, my dear Michael.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>I dare say you never tasted sweeter at your papa's table.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>That is very true.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Are you done? Come then, your bed is ready for you. <stage>(Valentine lies down. Michael spreads the rest of the hay over him, then takes off his jacket.)</stage> The nights are cold: here, cover yourself with this too. If you find yourself chilly, come to the fire; I'll take care that it does not go out. Good night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Dear Michael, I shall never be easy until I make you amends for my treating you ill.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Think no more of it; I do not. The lark will awake us to-morrow morning at break of day. <stage><hi>(Valentine falls asleep, and Michael sits up close by him to keep the fire up.
<pb n="140" facs="144"/>At break of day Michael awakes him.)</hi></stage> Come, master, you have slept enough. The lark has opened her song already, and the sun will soon appear behind the hill. Let us set out, and go to your papa's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val. </speaker>
<stage>(rubbing his eyes.)</stage>
<p>What already? so soon? Good morning, my dear Michael!</p>

<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Good morning, Master Valentine! How did you sleep?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val. </speaker>
<stage>(rising)</stage>
<p>As sound as a rock. Here is your jacket. I thank you a thousand, thousand times. I shall never forget you as long as I live.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mich.</speaker>
<p>Do not talk of thanks. I am as happy as you. Come, walk along with me. I'll guide you. <stage>(They go off.)</stage></p>

<p>Ah! do I see thee again, my dear child?</p>

<p>Yes, madam, there he is, ifegs! a little better mayhap than before you lost him.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>Is that the case?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Yes, papa I have been well punished for my pride. What will you give him that has reformed me?</p>

<p>A good reward, and with the greatest chearfulness.</p>

<p>Well, this is he to whom you owe it. I owe him my friendship too, and he shall always share it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>If that is so, I'll make him a little present every year of a couple of guineas, for curing you of so intolerable a fault.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
<p>And I will make him one of the same sum, for having preserved my son to me.</p>

<p>If you pay me for the satisfaction that you feel, I should pay you too for what I felt. So we are clear.</p>

<p>No, my little man, we shall not run from our words. But let us go to breakfast
<pb n="142" facs="146"/>all four. Valentine shall relate his adventures of the night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Yes, papa; and I shall not spare myself, though I should be turned into ridicule for them. I blush for my folly, but hope that I shall never have to blush for the same behaviour again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
<p>My dear son, how happy you will make your mother and me by proving that your reformation is sincere, and will never suffer a relapse.</p>
