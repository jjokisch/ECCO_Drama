<lg>
<l>AMONG the tawny sons of Indian lands,</l>
<l>The Hero, who aspires to lead their bands,</l>
<l>Must proof afford, ere he his cause can gain,</l>
<l>Of resolution, and contempt of pain:</l>
<l>Ere they'll confess him fit for them to die,</l>
<l>Whips, stings, and fire, his fortitude must try!</l>
<l>Assembled Chiefs the desp'rate contest view,</l>
<l>Inflict the torture, and the pang renew!</l>
<l>And, should he, while the flames his reins embrace,</l>
<l>Heave one poor sigh, or even breathe apace,</l>
<l>With scorn and ignominy, he's expell'd;</l>
<l>By boys and women in derision held!</l>
<l>But if, to pain superior, he comes forth</l>

<l>Applauding shouts re-echo to the skies,</l>
<l>And all hearts claim him as his country's prize!</l>

<l>Severe the task!—Who would to fame aspire</l>
<l>In lands like these, where Virtue's try'd by fire?</l>
<l>Scarce less severe his task who pants for fame,</l>
<l>Scorch'd by the ardour of Poetic flame;</l>
<l>While fable, diction, pathos, wit and taste,</l>
<l>Like scorpion whips, and racks, are round him plac'd:</l>

<l>"On the strong torture of the mind he lies!"</l>

<l>Rashly resolv'd to dare impending fate,</l>

<l>The Critic lash, the more than mortal stings,</l>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>THE immortal Author of Hudibras affirms, the hardest task in the world is to write a play; it is, therefore, no wonder that writers of plays are prone to regard their labours with fondness, even to partiality; or that they should perceive with regret the light esteem in which a part of the literary world have lately affected to hold them. Works of rudiment, of disquisition, nay, even, of mere compilation, are often treated by criticism with a respect which a comedy, or tragedy, where wit, invention, genius, and all the highest faculties of the mind have, or ought to have, been employed, seldom meets. The theatre, however it may be debased by the nightly intrusion of unhappy and improper persons, has a most powerful and good influence on morals, which increases with industry, and as the means of gaining admission among the lower class increase. Much time is there spent to the best, the noblest, of purposes; the body's fatigues are forgotten, the mind is beguiled of its cares, the sad heart is made merry, fictitious sorrow obliterates real, and the soul, imbibing virtuous and heroic principles, is roused and impelled to actions that honour not only individuals but nations, and give a dignity to human nature. Those who can doubt this are to be pitied. And it is piteous, most piteous, that, not only the learned, but, the political world should treat the stage with neglect; nay, with contempt:
<pb n="vi" facs="5"/>
that they do not combine, and employ the high powers they possess to the encouragement and perfection of an art which, being, in its own nature, so delightful, so fascinating, is capable of contributing, so infinitely, to the happiness, as well as to the pleasure, of mankind.</p>
<p>These ideas have long, and often, occurred to my mind, where they have acted with increasing force. If I have written a comedy which, perfectly moral in its tendency, and counteracting a fashionable vice that is in danger of becoming a vulgar one, has charms sufficient to attract spectators, I am of opinion I have done my country an essential service. That some who read this may call me vain or presumptuous is, to me, totally indifferent. The theatre is a subject of such consequence to virtue, happiness, and man, that I cannot forbear speaking of it with a sense of feeling which, I fear, I cannot impart.</p>
<p>I must now undertake a task of a very different and painful nature; the cause of my undertaking it shall be given, when I have told my story.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1785, I wrote the Opera of the Choleric Fathers, and the Comedy of Seduction. They were both put into the hands of Mr. Harris, on certain conditions; the substance of which was that, if, after reading, he should approve the pieces, they were both to be played, during the ensuing season, the first in November, and the latter in January,
<pb n="vii" facs="6"/>
or the beginning of February, 1786. They were read by Mr. Harris, and both accepted, on these conditions; and so precise, so perfectly explained, were they that they were reduced to writing. However, certain objections arising, on the part of Mr. Harris, concerning benefit nights (not the time of performing the pieces, for that remained determined) I, myself, tore the written agreement; saying, I thought it improbable men, who meant honestly and honourably, should differ in trifles; and that each other's word was sufficient.</p>
<p>When Mr. Harris had read Seduction, though he objected to parts, he was, yet, so well pleased with the whole, that he said, with evident, and peculiar, satisfaction, I had given the theatre a comedy which, he thought, would do it no harm.</p>
<p>Having made his objections, alterations were agreed on, and the comedy taken back. Further to prove how fully the word of Mr. Harris was engaged, how perfectly he understood himself pledged to abide by his agreement, while the Opera of the Choleric Fathers was preparing for representation, Mr. Harris sent to me, to make a new proposal, which, according to him, would highly benefit the theatre. This was that, instead of January, I should suffer the comedy to be brought out before Christmas, because he had a new pantomime (Omai) that would, in all probability, be greatly beneficial to the theatre, after Christmas, and that his season would then
<pb n="viii" facs="7"/>
be filled up, and, probably, exceedingly productive. That my interest might not suffer by this arrangement, he promised, in compensation, to suffer the new pantomime to be played for my third benefit, and, if the comedy ran a certain number of nights, for my fourth. When he made this proposition I desired time to consider, and consult my friends; and, at last, from a sincere wish to oblige Mr. Harris, and serve the theatre, acquiesced. This project, however, was deranged; not by me, or Mr. Harris; but by an event highly vexatious to both, and which I shall not relate now; perhaps never.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the play had received some alterations, and the insertion of a character so atrocious, yet so frequent, in this town, as to make, in the opinion of Mr. Harris, the representation of it dangerous. Accordingly, this was to be expunged, still further alterations were undertaken, and the comedy, a third time, delivered, as it is at present played, about the beginning of December, 1785. It will be necessary to remark that, before this, the Choleric Fathers had been performed, and did not take that run which Mr. Harris expected, and I had hoped; and that, knowing the changeable disposition of Mr. Harris, I cautioned him against suffering this mediocrity of success to influence, and prejudice, his mind against the comedy. He assured me it should not.</p>
<p>I must likewise state that, so self-denying
<pb n="ix" facs="8"/>
was I, and desirous of promoting the welfare of the theatre, when Mr. Harris informed me, by Mr. Lewis, he had no further hopes from the Opera, which had then been played seven nights, and that he would allow me the eighth instead of the ninth night, but adding he doubted whether I should clear expences; I, though there was no probability of loss, and, certainly, some of gain, gave up my third night to the theatre; telling Mr. Lewis I would not deprive Mr. Harris of a night, under such circumstances.</p>
<p>The Comedy remained with Mr. Harris, who, I was told, was gone out of town, till the beginning of January, without my receiving any information of its being preparing for rehearsal. I began to be alarmed; and, unable to obtain an interview, or even discover where Mr. Harris was, I wrote a letter to him, expressive of these alarms. I need not describe what my feelings were, a few days after, on receiving the comedy back, with a letter from Mr. Harris, in which these feelings were indeed little respected, informing me it could not succeed. The manner of sending it back was, almost, as extraordinary as the act. It was brought, loosely tied up with packthread, in a bit of dirty brown paper, unsealed, by the servant of Mr. O'Keefe. I mean not to insinuate any possible disadvantage to the character of Mr. O'Keefe: far to the contrary. I have often heard him honourably mentioned. Neither can I say how
<pb n="x" facs="9"/>
it came into his hands, or that he knew what it was; but this is no palliation of Mr. Harris's conduct. I returned no answer; it would have been exceedingly wrong to have trusted the irritated mind at such a moment.</p>
<p>I will now give my reasons for relating this transaction to the world. To pretend I did not feel all the indignation which conduct like this must kindle, would be to assume an apathy contrary to nature; and, even, to virtue. This, however, has worn off: I act coolly, at present, and from a sense of duty, not revenge. As far as relates to myself, I would wish the affair might never more be remembered; but, if men in similar situations might act thus <hi>always</hi> with impunity, as they <hi>too often</hi> do, what means could the weak and unprotected find of obtaining redress; what security in their dealings with a man, who, regardless of probity, and yielding to the caprice of opinion, the dictates of pride, or the narrow motives of self-interest, does not scruple to break his word, so pledged, and engagements thus formal?</p>
<p>This narrative will scarcely be more disagreeable to Mr. Harris to read than it has been to me to write: it is not my own cause I plead, for that was gained in the success of my Comedy; but the cause of the weak against the strong; the cause of hereafter genius against hereafter injustice; the cause of the man, who, endowed with gifts of which Nature herself is proud, but deprived of every
<pb n="xi" facs="10"/>
benefit of Fortune, shall devote his days and nights to study, and suffer every abstinence with resignation, and, even with delight, cheered by the sweet hope of being some time known for what he is. There is a momentary intoxication, a delirium of soul, in this hope, which not the daily privation of pleasures, the disappointments of years, the labours of a life, nor injustice itself can counterbalance. It is this godlike sensation which has given the mind an impetus, and made it produce works so various, and so vast, that, glancing at their amplitude and sublimity, it stands confounded at its own powers!</p>
<p>That I may avoid all appearance of mingling flattery with an appeal to justice, I shall forbear describing the conduct of the Proprietors of Drury-Lane; except saying, they have behaved to me like Gentlemen, and men of honour.</p>
<p>My heart will not, however, suffer me to be equally reserved, and silent, concerning Mr. King. The moment he was convinced the producing of this Comedy would probably serve, not injure, the Theatre, his zeal and activity, in my cause, were indefatigable: how very essentially his powers, as an actor, have contributed to its success is too public for me (had I a wish so selfish) to conceal. But this is not the first debt of gratitude from me to Mr. King; his friendship, or his philanthropy, while I was struggling into notice, and combating with adverse fortune, did me a generous
<pb n="xii" facs="11"/>
kindness which never can, nor ever ought to be forgotten.</p>
<p>The Town have beheld, with delight and surprise, the increasing excellence of Miss Farren; and, thinking she had attained perfection, have been astonished, when they saw her next, at their own mistake. In the present instance, her exertions, and even the very manner of them, have been as pleasing to me, as they were beneficial to the Comedy. I can only add, she has excelled herself; and, though that thought be old, it never was more properly applied.</p>
<p>Having mentioned these, it were injustice to the rest of the performers not to thank them; both for the display of talents, the merits of which are well known, and the ardour, I may say the anxiety, they testified for my success. Yes, I most sincerely thank them all; and only forbear to name them, individually, because I cannot find expressions, various and warm enough, to convey my thoughts, without making true and well deserved praise assume the form of laboured panegyric.</p>

<p>A wonderful change in a short time!—Lady Morden, young, handsome, and full of spirits, was, not a month ago, reserved in her conduct, fond of her husband, contented with home, and, indeed, a miraculous kind of exception among wives of quality. Whereas, now, she has suddenly turned fantastical in dress, capricious in temper, free of speech, and, what we half-bred folks should call, light of carriage. She games with the women, coquettes with the men, and seems, in every respect, ambitious to become—a woman of fashion. As for my Lord—why—he is a man of fashion.</p>

<p>General, good morrow.</p>
</sp>

<p>You seem scarcely awake.</p>

<p><stage>[stretching]</stage> Slept ill—troubled with the night-mare.</p>
</sp>

<p>Your troubles, I am afraid, are rapidly increasing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>How so, General?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>Lady Morden had a rout, last night!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh! and forgot to send you a card, I suppose.—Is that my fault?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>You are merry, my Lord; but he who drinks poison, out of a frolic, will soon be glad to send for a physician, out of fear; and the chances are the doctor will come too late.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Trope and figure!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>My Lord! my Lord! this levity is unseasonable: blushes, and shame, would better become you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Pff! They are out of fashion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes, you leave your friends to blush for your faults.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>My friends are very good; nay, indeed, generous; for, were they but to spare a single blush for each of their own faults, they would have none to bestow on mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>Fie! The mirth of a mad-man is sport only to boys—I was your guardian, I wished to prove myself your friend. 'Twas I first discovered that, then, angelic woman who is, now, Lady Morden; I was the cause of her
<pb n="10" facs="21"/>
union with you; and I am, therefore, accountable to myself, to her, and to society, for her conduct.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>That is, you are a kind of second-hand sponsor—Godfather-in-law, as it were.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>Very well, Sir! proceed! despise reproof! ridicule advice!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, good doctor, you really wrong me; 'tis not the advice, but the physic, I hate—At least, I hate the form under which it is administered—But, pray, tell me; when last you saw Lady Morden, did you perceive any symptoms of that degeneracy, in her Ladyship, you, now, complain so loudly of?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>None! I thought it impossible!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>And is it not rather extraordinary, then, that my example should, so suddenly, subdue what, within this month, seemed so invulnerable?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[Great surprise and energy]</stage> It is extraordinary, my Lord! most extraordinary! but not less true; and, had you any sense of your duty to yourself, your family, or society, the truth of it would make you tremble!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>See how differently different people understand things! My acquaintance are, every day, wishing me joy of her Ladyship's reformation; and telling me how surprisingly she has retrieved her character, in the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[sarcastically]</stage> And Sir Frederic Fashion, no doubt, among the rest!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[endeavouring to conceal his feelings]</stage> Hem!—yes—yes. He is one of our very first men, you know; and he is quite in
<pb n="11" facs="22"/>
raptures with her—swears she was born to lead and outshine us all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[with continued irony]</stage> The approbation of so great an adept must give you vast pleasure!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem!—a—infinite!—Not but this sudden change has, rather, surprised me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>How so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Just as you left town, her Ladyship's melancholy seemed increasing—wandering over the house, like a perturbed spirit, as the play says, mournfully clanking her chains, and frightening the gentle smiles and pleasures from her, she seemed to way-lay me, and, with moving look, and melting eye, intreat compassion; till, egad, I, really, at last, began to pity her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>You did!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes—But, suddenly forsaking the—<hi>penseroso,</hi> she broke in upon me, one morning, and, with an air of levity and good humour, and a small tincture of reproach, then, and there, read me a very pretty, wifelike, remonstrance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>To which you listened with a truly picktooth insensibility.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes—You know my way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>And what was the subject of her discourse?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why, chapter the first was a recapitulation of my agreeable follies, and her own perverse virtues.—She was no partaker in my pleasures—I had forgot every endearment—She was left to dine, sup, and sleep, by herself—I dined, supped, and slept, nobody knew where.—She more recluse than the abbess of a convent:
<pb n="12" facs="23"/>
I more uncertain than the price of stocks, or the place of prime minister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[with earnest concern]</stage> And what did you say to this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[aside]</stage> I must face it out. <stage>[aloud]</stage> Say? What could I say to such a simple woman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>You did not attempt to deny the charge, then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>What should I deny? 'Twas every syllable true; and every syllable in my praise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[sighs]</stage> Humph!—Then you do not think, the sweets of affection ought, sometimes, to alleviate the bitterness of neglect.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Sweets! pshaw! they are too cloying to the stomach, and ought to be taken sparingly.—I am fond of sweet music, but too much of it sets me to sleep.—Besides, a wife, like a barrel organ, can only play one set of tunes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[sighs]</stage> Well, Sir, but the conclusion?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>A very unexpected one, I assure you—I misunderstood this for a declaration of war; and, with a smile, was very obligingly about to intreat her Ladyship would hatch her melancholy into mischief her own way: when, turning short upon me, she curtsied, seemed abashed, began to apologize, applaud my conduct, ridicule the silliness of her own, and promised to become as fashionable a Lady as I, or any Lord in Christendom, could wish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>Your increase of happiness is, then, prodigious?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem!—a—unspeakable.—Lady Morden, I own, was, certainly, a kind of—
<pb n="13" facs="24"/>
Demi-Angel, tho' my wife—but, then, her—her goodness seemed to throw one at such a distance—so much in the back ground that there was only one figure noticed in the picture!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>'Tis well, Sir, you are so perfectly satisfied.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, General, I will own, I have often felt a kind of inclination, a sort of wish, as it were, to become very prudent, and wise, and—and all that—but, really, one has so much to do that one does not know where to begin.—Besides, you very good kind of people, you—upon my honour, you are, in many respects, the most queer, precise, particular, species of beings, and have such strange notions!—Instead of taking one's pleasure, and doing just what one likes best, which, you know, is so natural, one must live for the good of one's country, love one's wife and children, pay tradesmen, look over accounts, reward merit, and a thousand other of the—the most ridiculous whims—and what nobody, absolutely, nobody does.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>Intolerable profligacy!—I have listened to you, my Lord, with grief, vexation, astonishment, and pity!—Your mind is degraded; and the more dangerously so because you believe your worst vices to be your greatest merits! You have had honour, happiness, and pleasure, of the most perfect kind, within your power; and you have rejected them, to clasp their shadows! To merit pity by misconduct is humiliating; but, by misconduct to incur contempt is, to a manly spirit, insupportable; and the latter will, I fear, be suddenly your Lordship's fate. Did not the remembrance of your noble father affect me, I should look upon your approaching punishment
<pb n="14" facs="25"/>
with apathy; because you wilfully have plunged to perdition: but, for your Lady, if I cannot retrieve, if I cannot save her, I shall mourn indeed!</p>

<p>Yes—I have discovered that one of my most capital errors, formerly, was being too sensible of my own defects.—I find that to wear, on one's countenance, an open, and avowed, consciousness that one possesses every grace and perfection, is the grand secret of really possessing them: or, at least, of persuading the world one really does, which is the same thing.</p>

<p><stage>[to Lapelle.]</stage> Leave the room—I am sorry we were disturbed; your story, Madam, has interested me deeply: though too reprehensible for the irregularities of my own conduct, I cannot but condemn the licentious libertinism of this Sir Frederic—Indeed, I—I have reason, perhaps, to dread it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>A man of honour, among men, the ruin of woman he thinks as necessary to his fame as to his pleasure; and, like too many others of your cruel sex, holds it no crime to make war upon those who cannot defend themselves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>But what do you propose, by this disguise, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>There is a contract, which I, indeed, refused, but which he forced upon me, to demonstrate, as he said, the purity of his intentions,
<pb n="20" facs="31"/>
wherein he bound himself, in a penalty of ten thousand pounds, to marry me within a month: for, in his fictitious raptures, he protested no sum, no proofs, could sufficiently express the ardour, and sanctity, of his affection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>And have you this contract?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>Oh, no! The day preceding that on which it was my good fortune to discover his real designs, he asked to see, and artfully exchanged it, for a counterfeit copy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>This contract you wish to regain?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>If possible; or some other unequivocal means of detection.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>And force him to marry you?</p>

<p>Oh, no—To own the truth, I have a generous and a constant lover, who, perhaps, has been a little ill used.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>As most generous and constant lovers are.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>'Tis too true.—To avenge him, and humble the pride of one who thinks himself too cunning for our whole sex, is my determination.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, Madam, ours is a common cause—But, as we have both been imprudent, and invited misfortune, we must both endeavour to conceal our true feelings, mask our suspicions, and—Hush! Here he comes; and with him a lady, whose principles are as free as his own; but who has had the art so well to conceal her intrigues, and preserve appearances, that she is every where received in society.—I will introduce you, in your assumed character.</p>

<head>SCENE III. <stage>MRS. MODELY <hi>and</hi> SIR FREDERIC.</stage></head>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Really, Sir Frederic, there is no accounting for the strangeness of your present taste!—I pity you!—I foresee the downfall of your reputation!—What, you! who have vanquished so many elegant coquettes, and driven so many happy lovers mad; you! who were the very soul of our first societies, and whose presence made palpitate the hearts of belles and beaux; the first with hope and delight, the latter with fear and envy; you! sighing at the feet of a prude, and become the rival of a husband!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[laughing]</stage> Deplorable!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Have not you, for this month past, buried yourself in Lady Morden's sober society, and dozed over crown whist with her, night after night?—Nay, have not you attended her even to church; and, there, with a twang, joined the amen chorus of charity-children, paupers, and parish-clerks; sitting with your face drawn as long as its shadow at sun-set; and a look as demure and dismal—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>As poor Doctor Faustus, waiting for the Devil to come and fetch him—Ha, ha, ha!—Granted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>And what do you think has been said of you, mean while, in the polite circles you have abandoned?—Your very best friends have been the very first to condemn you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>That's natural—When we are guilty of any folly, our very best friends are always
<pb n="22" facs="33"/>
the very first to condemn us; to shew they neither advise nor countenance us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>I thought the gay, young, beauty, besieged by pleasures, surrounded by flatteries, who believes herself the goddess she is painted, to fix her wandering fancy, to humble and bring her to a sense of frailty; or, to supplant the happy, the adored, lover, while yet the breath is warm that vows eternal constancy; these, I imagined, were the only atchievements worthy Sir Frederic Fashion!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>These have their eclat. But, to initiate a youthful, beauteous, wife, who, from her childhood, has been accustomed to say her prayers, believe in virtue, and rank conjugal infidelity among the most heinous of the seven deadly sins; to teach her to doubt, fear, wish, tremble, and venture; to be a witness, afterward, of her repentance; her tears involuntarily falling, her eyes motionless, her form fixed, and the severe saint transformed to a statue of weeping sin; to read her fall in the public papers; be praised, reproached, admired, and curst, in every family in England; in short, to be for ever immortalized, in the annals of gallantry, and the hero of the tea-table for a whole month, for this will be no common vulgar wonder, this were glory equal to my ambition! And this glory I am determined to acquire: nay, it is, already, within my grasp.—This day, or, rather, this night, this very, blessed, ecstatic, night, shall I gain the greatest of all my victories!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Insulting!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, my dear Mrs. Modely, you know my enthusiasin, and must not take exceptions—Nor can I, surely, be blamed. Lady
<pb n="23" facs="34"/>
Morden is a concealed hoard of native sweets, that delights the senses: while the made-up beauties we commonly meet, like artificial flowers, are all shew, and no fragrance.</p>

<p>It matters not wasting your rhetoric on this topic; for I will not give my consent to your pursuing this affair any further, Sir Frederic.</p>

<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>You will not?</p>

<p><stage>[aside.]</stage> No; I know you better.— <stage>[aloud]</stage> Oh! the General is an eccentric mortal; licensed to say any thing; and, instead of being listened to, is laughed at.</p>

<p><stage>[conceiving her design]</stage> True!</p>
</sp>

<p><stage>[laughs]</stage> Infallibly!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Your fortune, I believe, Sir Frederic, like your family seat, begins to want repairs; and she is a rich heiress, with twenty thousand pounds at her own disposal, beside the General's estate, which must be hers—Why do you laugh so?</p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha!—This surprise from you, Mrs. Modely, is the supreme of panegyric.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>And have you made any advances to Emily?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes, yes—Ha, ha, ha!—I made advances to her, and she made advances to me—The conquest was too easy—Were it not for the circumstance of the elopement, which will give the sauce a flavour the food wants, it would scarcely invite my appetite.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>But Lady Morden—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Is mine, whenever I please to make my final attack. I am no bad orator, in general; but, in company with her, I seem inspired—am, absolutely, astonished at my own eloquence!—Nay, I have several times spoken with such energy, enthusiasm, and momentary conviction, in praise of virtue, that I have, actually, been in imminent danger of making a convert of myself!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>In praise of virtue?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>In praise of virtue. There is no making one of these virtuous visionaries rational, but by flattering their bigotry, and pretending to adore their idol; by pursuing which method, I have inured her to, and made her as familiar with, what is prudishly called vice, and vicious sentiments, as she is with her own thoughts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, vile rake: but, remember, I'll have no concern in this affair!—I—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh, poh! Ay, ay, that is understood—You
<pb n="26" facs="37"/>
wink—and know nothing of the matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, but I, here, publicly protest against your proceedings!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[aside]</stage> And will privately do your utmost to promote them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>I exclaim against such licentiousness!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>I know you do—But, if you are thus tender of her Ladyship's reputation, you will feel no repugnance at assisting me to irritate his Lordship's sensibility.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>To confess the truth, I am a little piqued at Lord Morden's want of feeling—I wish I could make him jealous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Jealous! Fie! He is too well bred.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>That's unfortunate.—The antics of a jealous husband add highly to the enjoyment, as well as the reputation, of an amour.—The poor man is so injured, so enraged, so distressed, so industrious to publish his calamity, and is so sincerely pitied, and laughed at—must, positively, rouse my Lord to a sense of his misfortune; or it will want poignancy—A turtle feast without French wines!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, should I find any opportunity of aiding you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ay, ay; I have no doubt of your zeal in the cause.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, but, don't mistake me—I only mean as far as teazing his Lordship is concerned.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh! Certainly—certainly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>If his Lordship had any real
<pb n="27" facs="38"/>
cause for jealousy, I should, for Lady Morden's ake, be the—the—the—the—the most miserable creature upon earth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>To be sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>But you seem mighty secure of your conquest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am no novice; I can tell when a woman's time is come.—Besides, her Ladyship has granted me a rendezvous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>When?</p>

<p>Oh! a's brimful of such nonsense—and so were I, while I lived wi' he; which wur the reason, as I do suppose, that they called me a Simpleton—but I am not so simple as folk think me.</p>

<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes, yes—that is, for Emily, and the elopement—but, be cautious; a defeat would turn the tables upon us, and make us the jest of the whole town, friends and enemies.</p>

<p>She did?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh, yes.—She is a charming woman!—the eyes of the whole room were upon her. There were some smart things said—One observed a likeness between me and Actaeon; another thought it bore a far greater resemblance to your Lordship.</p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha! About the head, no doubt?</p>

<p>You were very kind.</p>

<p>No.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>'Tis very true. I should not have suspected Sir Peter of such vulgar revenge; but, I find, our married men of fashion are far less liberal in their sentiments than the Ladies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Yes; they often want a woman's philosophy in these matters.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes—they are wasps, that fly and feed wherever they can find honey, but retain a sting for any marauder that shall approach their nests.</p>

<p>Somewhat selfish, I own.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>You are partial, A little more experience will make these things quite familiar; but habit only can give one perfect ease.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh! Habit—Habit is a wonderful thing!—Have you heard the anecdote of the Newmarket-Jockey?</p>

<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>No; what is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why, a Jockey, having had a bad run at the last October meeting, was willing to correct the errors of Fortune by turning his lead to gold; accordingly, on Epping Forest, he stopped Major Warboys, and bade him deliver; to which the Major, being one of those singular officers who think it some disgrace to be robb'd, replied by firing his pistol—The ball happened to be fatal—the horse set off—and, to shew the effect of habit, the body of the Jockey kept its seat as far as the stable door, and there deliberately tumbled off; nay, some go so far as to assert it was seen to rise in the stirrups; but that, I believe, wants confirmation.</p>

<p>It seems strange that your people, who have acquired a little knowledge, always think they possess an infinite deal; while those, who are the best informed, appear continually conscious of wanting more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>Not strange at all, my Lord. Amassing knowledge is like viewing the sun through a telescope; you enlarge the object, but you destroy the glare.</p>

<p>The widow Twinkle, as usual, talked a vast deal about reputation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>One is apt to admire a thing one wants.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>She always takes infinite pains to place her reputation, like broken china in a buffet, with the best side outward.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="41" facs="52"/>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>She may plaister, and cement, but will never bring it to bear handling.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Mr. Pensive, the poet, came in, too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes, but as nobody took any notice of him, he presently went out again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>A great proof of his good sense.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Your poets, and sheriff's-officers, are a kind of people every body has heard of, but that nobody chooses to know.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Or, if you are under the necessity of receiving a private call from them, now and then, it would be quite disgraceful to be seen with them in public.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Your Ladyship used to be very partial to Mr. Pensive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes, her Ladyship <hi>used</hi> to have many singular partialities. She was once partial to merit and virtue, wherever she found them: she had a partiality for order, oeconomy, and domestic duties, likewise: nay, she even went so far as to cherish a partiality for your Lordship!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! Odious partialities!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>No!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>No—I cannot accuse myself of any fault; unless the love of pleasure be one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hah! <stage>[sighs]</stage> And your catalogue of pleasures, I fancy, is pretty extensive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Not half so extensive as one could wish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>A dice-box, for instance, is one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>A very principal one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>My short experience hardly entitles me to venture an opinion, but I find a wonderful similarity between gaming and a cold bath—You have a—a tremor—a—a hesitation, at first; but, having once plunged in, you are thrown into the most delightful glow!</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh, an ardent tingling—</p>

<p>That is strange, when you yourself make it.</p>

<p>Why—Upon my word—General—I—I have so many affairs on hand, to day, that I must beg you—to excuse me:—Tomorrow, you may command me, for as long as you please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ay, do, General, have the complaisance to wait till to-morrow, when my Lady will be more at leisure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[deeply affected]</stage> Well, madam▪ I did not use to be thought an intruder, by your Ladyship, and will not begin now—But, since I cannot have the honour to tell you privately, I still think myself bound to do my duty, and inform you, publicly, you are in the hands of sharpers, "who will filch from you your good name"— <stage>[with great anxiety]</stage> Nay, perhaps, you are on the very eve of destruction!—Oh guile!—Can it be!—My heart is full!—I— <stage>[goes up to her, and most affectionately takes and presses her hand]</stage> Lady Morden—I have no utterance—But, if there be such a thing as sympathy, some small portion of the horror I now feel will communicate itself to you.</p>

<p>Hist!—Sir Frederic!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[turning back]</stage> Oh!—Well, Sir, how proceeds your amour? I thought you had been busied in schemes about that affair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>Faidth, and I am so—But I don't believe I can succeed, without your assistance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Perhaps, you are a little scrupulous about the means.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>Me!—Indeed and you have mistaken your man—Why, you don't think, Sir Frederic, I regard the complaints or tears of women!—You and I, sure, seek our own gratification, not their happiness—For, if the love of man sought only the happiness of woman, faidth, there would be nothing but dull marriages, fond husbands, and legitimate children; and we should lose all the satisfaction of seducing wives, ruining daughters, and of bringing so many fine, sweet, innocent, craters upon the town!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh, it would strangely reverse the order of things.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>Order!—Faidth, and it would occasion a blissed confusion—in Doctor's Commons.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>For my part, present pleasure is my pursuit; I never disturb my imagination with dismal conjectures, on future consequences.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>Faidth, and you are right—For, as you say, it would be dismal enough to trace these consequences into—into streets, and hospitals, and—places that the imagination sickens at.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Marriage, you say, is not your object.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="46" facs="57"/>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>Oh, no! I don't like that said matrimony music.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>A mortgaged rent-roll, only, can make it supportable. A wife is like a child's whistle, which every breath can play upon, but which no art can make melodious.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>Faidth, and you have viry proper notions about wives. So, whin the dare crater gave a marriage hint, why, I told her a dale of boister, consarning an old cross fadther, and being under age, and that I could not marry these three months. For, you know, one does not stand for a good double handful of oaths, and lies, whin one wants to ruin a sweet, kind, angel, that one loves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!—Suppose you were to make a sham marriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>A sham marriage?—Faidth, and I would make that, if there were not a parcel of low rascals, that make halters.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Pshaw! That's a paltry, mechanical, fear.</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>No—The only danger, in trusting them to you, is that of losing them. And, even then, there could be no ill consequence; except by falling into the hands of one who is far enough from London.</p>

<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>This fellow would outwit a whole conclave of Cardinals!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, Sir Frederic! here I am, you see; punctual to my promise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[with vast insinuation, seeming sincerity, and humble rapture, all through the scene.]</stage> Oh, Madam, how can I repay this bounty!—this condescension!—Never!—My life were a poor sacrifice, to such sweetness and such charms!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Sir Frederic, this is a trying, a decisive moment! I am going to be either the most happy or the most wretched of women! You tell me, it is your wish, your resolution, to be no longer that general lover, that man of the world, you have, hitherto, been thought.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>Say not, dear Lady, it is either my wish or resolution! Heaven can testify, I have not the power to be any thing, but what it shall please you to make me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>I have owned to you that, the levity I have lately affected is not natural to me▪ that my heart sighs for an acquaintance, a mate▪ that, like itself, is subject to all the sweet emotions of sensibility!—Yes, it was the first wish of my soul to find this correspondent heart! A heart beating with the same ardour, vibrating to the same sensations, panting for the same pleasures, shrinking from the same pangs; pliant, yet firm; gentle, yet aspiring; passionate, yet pure!—Such I once thought Lord Morden's—Should I, a second time, be deceived!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="75" facs="86"/>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am poor in proofs of sincerity! I have none to offer!—My former errors are present punishments! To deny or even palliate them would imply intentional deceit; and this is a moment in which I would wish for men and gods to be witnesses of my truth!—I have had, I own, most libertine opinions of your gentle sex; but these I, now, solemnly renounce!—Had I, before, met with a Lady Morden, I should, before, have made this renunciation!—But, perhaps, the women it has been my misfortune to know deserved, in part, the light esteem in which I held them.—Never, till now, did I find one who could mutually inspire such passion and respect! Such agitated, burning, hopes! Such excruciating fears, or thoughts so sanctified, as those I, this moment, feel!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yet, Sir Frederic, I cannot help observing your conversation, in society, seems still tinged with the impurity of your former libertine principles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>I own, Lady Morden, with confusion own, I have not hitherto had the courage, or, perhaps, I have wanted strength to stem the torrent: but, aided by you, I feel, I dare promise any thing!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>I confess, Sir Frederic, the mind finds some difficulty in rooting out fears, planted in it by reiterated accusations. The stories the world tells of you are dreadful! And, yet, there is such heartfelt conviction attends your present words that, to me, it is impossible to listen and retain a doubt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>This generous confidence transports me, fills me with gratitude, and inspires
<pb n="76" facs="87"/>
rapturous hope! <stage>[clasps her round the waist.]</stage> Oh, gently suffer me to conduct you, where love lies, in panting, breathless, ecstasy—</p>

Though you are taken somewhat unawares, you cannot want invention!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Frederic.</hi></speaker>
<p>You'll pardon me, Madam, if I want understanding to comprehend your meaning.</p>

<p>Pray, Madam, stay, and receive the compliments of the company—Mine, and your <hi>friend</hi> Emily's, in particular.</p>

<p>Oh, with pleasure!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>Mr. Wilmot! My best brother!—Though you have, in part, acquainted me with what is past, yet, it is so sudden—And you! my dearest Lady! To find you still the same is joy unspeakable!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>The task of making you suppose I had effectually become what I seemed, was, indeed, most painful; but the loss of your affection were not pain! 'Twere horror!—I told you my passion was too permanent to be shaken—Ah! how could you imagine I meant another? Or think it possible I ever could forget that chaste, that ardent, that eternal, love, I have so repeatedly vowed?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>

<p><stage>[with affected candour]</stage> Certainly not.</p>

<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>
<p>If man is sometimes vain, presumptuous, and unprincipled, and if you are a man—am I to blame?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Certainly not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Wilmot.</hi></speaker>

<p>Certainly not.</p>

<p>Harriet!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir—that Harriet, whom, hearing she had happiness in view, and proportioning your ideal triumph to the weight of misery you might entail, you raised heaven and earth to bring to wretchedness, and ruin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>Upon my honour, you—you are a sad man, Sir Frederic!—A very sad man!</p>
<stage>[The company by their looks shew they understand Mrs. Modely's real character.]</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
<p>But your vanity is humbled—you, now, stand detected; and, instead of envied, you will be sneered at by the depraved, pitied by the good, and, henceforth, avoided by the credulous young creatures you, so manfully, have delighted to involve in guilt, and destruction!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Modely.</hi></speaker>
<p>A very dangerous man, indeed, Sir Frederic!</p>

<p>Then, Madam—the—the contract—</p>

<p>No thanks, Sir.</p>

<speaker>Gen. <hi>Burland.</hi></speaker>
<p>No; they would sit a little awkwardly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Morden.</hi></speaker>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Miss FARREN.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>IN former times—'tis long ago, I own—</l>
<l>Man, seated on the haughty husband's throne,</l>
<l>The wife by such absurd restraints enclos'd,</l>
<l>Not one gallant had she—as he suppos'd:</l>
<l>But, modest, meek, his jealous doubts appeas'd,</l>
<l>And sooth'd her lord and master—when she pleas'd.</l>
<l>Then, women led such exemplary lives,</l>
<l>Daughters, almost, as humble were—a—as wives!</l>
<l>"A savage Salick law the men maintain'd;</l>
<l>"O monstrous! We were slaves! and husband's reign'd."—</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Strange were these customs, obsolete; but we</l>
<l>Consolidate our customs—and, you see,</l>
<l>Such wise designs no opposition find:</l>
<l>A fair free trade is good for all mankind.</l>
<l>The lib'ral spirit of our lib'ral beauties</l>
<l>Has quite annull d prohibitory duties.</l>
<l>The Cicisbeo, and the <hi>chere amie,</hi></l>
<l>On the broad base of reciprocity,</l>
<l>Are exports now, and imports, duty free.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>As for this Lady Morden's motley merit,</l>
<l>With her half-ancient, her half-modern spirit,</l>
<l>You'll imitate the part you most approve;</l>
<l>Her modish licence, or her maukish love!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Of that no more—The subject of my speech,</l>
<l>The doctrine I came, purposely, to teach,</l>
<l>(Nay, look not low'ring, man of mighty sense)</l>
<l>Is rival woman's super-eminence—*</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Yes, we have proofs where wit, where taste combin'</l>
<l>"To deck, with blended charms, the female mind.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Say, shall not we, with conscious pride, proclaim</l>
<l>"A female critic rais'd—ev'n Shakespear's Fame!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Yes, lordly man—look surly if you please,</l>
<l>"But women beat you out and out, with ease!</l>
<l>"In tales of fancy, tenderness, distress,</l>
<l>"If you dare doubt us—study <hi>The Recess.</hi></l>
<l>"And oft let soft <hi>Cecilia</hi> win your praise;</l>
<l>"While Reason guides the clue, in Fancy's maze.</l>
<l><pb facs="96"/>
"In tragedy our triumph all attest;</l>
<l>"Your tears the genuine proof who acts the best—</l>
<l>"In comedy—But hold—I dread to say</l>
<l>"How much, of late, ev'n there, you've lost the day."</l>
<l>No, I'll not humble your proud sex so far,</l>
<l>Till you no more remember—SUCH THINGS ARE.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Gladly our author owns, all this is true;</l>
<l>Nor thinks he's robb'd, when others have their due:</l>
<l>Yet, owning, hopes you've kindly heard his cause;</l>
<l>Hopes to participate your just applause.</l>
<l>And, should your hands some grateful wreath combine,</l>
<l>And should that wreath his anxious brow entwine,</l>
<l>The prize most precious mem'ry holds in store,</l>
<l>It there shall bloom—'till mem'ry is no more! <note place="foot"><p>* The verses, between inverted commas, were requested from, and written by, a gentleman whose literary abilities are great, and well known; and the following were, consequently, omitted.</p>

<l>Is rival woman's super-eminence</l>
<l>In wit, as well as beauty! Proofs I could</l>
<l>But will not cite, to make th' assertion good.</l>
<l>Why should I speak, what's known to Fame and you,</l>
<l>Young André's woes; the wrongs of old Peru?</l>
<l>Why the Belle's Stratagem, or Percy name;</l>
<l>Or sweet Cecilia's never ending fame?</l>
<l>Our comic, or our tragic, triumphs quote;</l>
