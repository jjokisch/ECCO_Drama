<head>TO EUSTACE BUDGELL, <abbr>Esq</abbr></head>
<opener><salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOSE who devote themselves to POETRY, have but one Way of paying the highest Favours; their Returns are only the Fruits of that Art which they cultivate; and they might well bewail this as a Partiality in Nature, were not the Gifts of Genius sometimes beyond those of Fortune. Men who, like your Self, can give Eternity to Names they honour, have no Reason to complain of the Muses: But such as we, who have it in our
<pb facs="4"/>
Wills to be grateful, and are shorten'd in the only Powers we have to shew it, feel greater Uneasiness from Obligations, than is easy to be express'd. In such a Situation, we have nothing left, but our Attempts to please; and these your superior Geniuses must look upon rather as a Homage, than a Return; the Effects of our good Wishes, rather than the Accomplishment of our Desires.</p>
<p>NEXT to being eminent in one's own Character, to be distinguish'd by Men of Excellence, is the happiest Praise; and as one of these is very often introductory to the other, so has it happen'd to you; the <hi>Greatest Men</hi> among us first observ'd and cherish'd your Merit, and you soon return'd the Acknowledgment, by making that Merit useful and ornamental to your Country. What a noble Testimony do your living Virtues give to the Discernment of the late Lord <hi>HALIFAX!</hi> that Great Man had the peculiar Happiness of
<pb facs="5"/>
making Wit and Learning not only a Qualification for his Friendship, but of Service to the Business and Management of publick Affairs. The Familiarity you have always entertain'd with the first Men of Letters, and the Applause with which you have acted, and still continue to act, in the Sphere of Business, are equally to your Honour, and have set your Character as much above Flattery, as Detraction.</p>
<p>FOR my Part, it has always been my Ambition to desire the good Opinion of Men of your Turn; and I never have, or shall be asham'd of publishing the Virtues of those who have been eminent in their Services for our KING, Country, and Legal Constitution; and in this View (if any Thing of mine can reach so far) would I be look'd upon by Posterity.</p>
<p>IN the mean Time, I cannot but congratulate my Country for breeding such gallant free Spirits, who,
<pb facs="6"/>
like your Self, have rose up in Opposition to the two most implacable Powers that can be let loose upon Mankind, <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Popery.</hi> It is your Praise, Sir, to have acted a most noble Part on this Account, in the <hi>Irish Senate;</hi> a Country more than once the Scene of the most dreadful Massacres, but now, by the Actions of YOU and your fellow PATRIOTS, happily recover'd from the same threat'ning (and oh! too near) impending Persecution.</p>
<p>SUCH publick Services as these, tho' they give Joy and Blessings to a whole Nation, yet they more nearly affect those who have a Share in your Esteem. Among the great Number that your Merit have made your Friends, I am proud to be accounted one, and to have it known to the World, I had your Permission to prefix your Name to this TRAGEDY. I shall be very negligent with the Criticks, and set my Heart at Rest on Account of the Envious,
<pb facs="7"/>
if it has the good Fortune in the least to please, and divert one Hour of your Retirement. It comes to you with sincere Wishes for a happy <hi>New-Year,</hi> for a long and uninterrupted Health; and that you may remain, what now you are, an Ornament to the Post you fill, and Blessing to the Nation you are happily planted in, are the hearty Wishes and Prayers of,</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<head type="sub"><stage>Spoken by Mr. WILKS.</stage></head>
<byline>By Mr. SEWELL.</byline>
<lg>
<l>THIS <hi>Play</hi> (I wonder how the Thing could hold!)</l>
<l>Is, if I reckon right, two Winters old;</l>
<l>It should have courted you the last hard Frost,</l>
<l>But you in <hi>Ice</hi> and <hi>Politicks</hi> were lost,</l>
<l>Two slipp'ry <hi>Things</hi>—Some know it to their Cost.</l>
<l>The prudent Mother, therefore, with good Reason,</l>
<l>Wean'd not this Child before a better Season:</l>
<l>Well-pleas'd she sees the Madness of the Age</l>
<l>Spent in an Impotent Successless Rage.</l>
<l>From civil Life transfer your Horrors <hi>here,</hi></l>
<l>And give to <hi>Tragedy</hi> its proper Sphere.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Our <hi>Woman</hi> says, for 'tis a <hi>Woman</hi>'s Wit,</l>
<l>(That <hi>single Word</hi> will gain us half the <hi>Pit</hi>)</l>
<l>This is her first Attempt in <hi>Tragick-Stuff;</hi></l>
<l>And here's <hi>Intrigue,</hi> and <hi>Plot,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> enough.</l>
<l>The Devil's in it, if the <hi>Sex</hi> can't write</l>
<l>Those Things in which <hi>They</hi> take the most Delight:</l>
<l><pb facs="9"/>
If she has touch'd these <hi>Scenes</hi> with artful Care,</l>
<l>Be kind, and all her smaller Failings spare.</l>
<l>The <hi>Ladies</hi> sure will ease a <hi>Woman</hi>'s Fears,</l>
<l>For common Pity's Sake, the <hi>Men</hi> for Thiers.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>On Hopes like these her <hi>Tragedy</hi> depends,</l>
<l>Not on confed'rate Clubs of clapping Friends,</l>
<l>Dispos'd in Parties to support her Cause,</l>
<l>And bully you by Noise, into Applause.</l>
<l>If she must sue, she scorns those vulgar Arts,</l>
<l>But fain by nobler Means would win your <hi>Hearts;</hi></l>
<l>Tell you she wears her Country, in her Breast,</l>
<l>And is as firmly <hi>Loyal,</hi> as the <hi>best;</hi></l>
<l>Then bid your <hi>Hearts</hi> their kindest Pray'rs convey,</l>
<l>And meet your coming MONARCH on his Way;</l>
<l>Who, from one peaceful Journey, brings us more</l>
<l>Than our long List of conq'ring KINGS before;</l>
<l>For ne'er did <hi>Britain</hi>'s Hopes so highly Tower,</l>
<l>Or promise such a glorious Stretch of Power,</l>
<l>As on that Day, which shall to Council bring</l>
<l>The <hi>Bravest Senate,</hi> and the Greatest KING;</l>
<l>Whose rip'ning Schemes shall distant Nation's Rule,</l>
<l>Make <hi>Tyrants</hi> tremble, and <hi>Divans</hi> grow cool:</l>
<l>To <hi>Britain</hi>'s Ensigns then, as They decree,</l>
<l>The World shall strike by <hi>Land,</hi> as well as <hi>Seae,</hi></l>

<l>AWAY, 'tis all Romantick;</l>
<l>The lazy Virtue of some dreaming Hermit:</l>
<l>Far be Ambition from their homely Cells:</l>
<l>But what hast thou to do with ill-tim'd Honesty?</l>
<l>Observe me well, and treasure in thy Soul</l>
<l>The experienc'd Wisdom of thy Father;</l>
<l>Let Interest be thy bright unerring Guide,</l>
<l>The secret darling Purpose of thy Heart.</l>
<l>Believe me, Boy, she reigns Supreme below;</l>
<l>Honours and endless Pleasure wait around her;</l>
<l>When she commands, smile on the Man thou hatest,</l>
<l>Caress him to inevitable Ruin.</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="12"/>
From foolish Pity guard thy well-taught Mind;</l>
<l>To Women leave the fond Deceiver, Love;</l>
<l>That Bar to Glory, and to great Revenge.</l>
<l>Think not of Friendship, more than of a Word,</l>
<l>Which, once gone forth, is lost in idle Air.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>Is this the Language of Paternal Love?</l>
<l>Forbid it, all good Men, that I should think so.</l>
<l>You mean to prove my Soul, and 'tis most just;</l>
<l>For many wear the borrow'd Mask of Goodness;</l>
<l>But I was made in Scorn of Artifice;</l>
<l>Superior Virtue is my awful Goddess,</l>
<l>My pleasing Motive, and my wish'd Reward.</l>
<l>Whether she leads me to the active Field,</l>
<l>Or the more dangerous Court, she guides my Life:</l>
<l>Fame, Honour, Wealth, when by her Hand bestow'd,</l>
<l>With grateful Joy submissive I'll receive them;</l>
<l>But offer'd by the World in Lieu of her,</l>
<l>With Scorn I'd throw them back, as empty Trifles,</l>
<l>Unworthy of an honest Man's Regard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ante.</speaker>
<l>Dull Moralist! hast thou no Taste of Power!</l>
<l>No Thirst of Glory! No ambitious Longings,</l>
<l>To raise thy Soul, and bear thee up to Empire?</l>
<l>And can'st thou let <hi>Lorenzo</hi> tower above thee?</l>
<l>Call to Remembrance all thy noble Ancestors,</l>
<l>Who all fell Victims to the Rage of his.</l>
<l>Consider this; then think if thou art injur'd</l>
<l>Enough to prompt thee to a great Revenge.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>Far be the Thought of Vengeance from my Soul;</l>
<l>I view with equal Justice Friends and Enemies:</l>
<l>Pride may perhaps pronounce This, Weakness in me.</l>
<l>No Matter what the haughty Mind suggests;</l>
<l>I'd rather wear the Name of Good than Great.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ante.</speaker>
<l>Why, this is finely said.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>For <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> since my Royal Master,</l>
<l>Whose great undoubted Right has Power to give,</l>
<l>Bestow'd on him the Honours which I wore;</l>
<l>Long may they slourish with him; who shall dare</l>
<l>Blame you in giving or resuming Favours?</l>
<l>Then ought we, Sir, t' impose on Majesty,</l>
<l>What in our selves we would not bear?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Ante.</speaker>
<l>Go on, go on, pursue this darling Vapour,</l>
<l>Unthinking to what Precipice it leads;</l>
<l>Extol <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> dwell upon his Praise,</l>
<l>And help to swell the popular Applause.</l>
<l>Forget the Conquests that have crown'd thy Valour,</l>
<l>The numerous Wounds thou hast sustain'd in Battel</l>
<l>For this insulting, this ungrateful King!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>Wore not my Sword the Freedom of my Country?</l>
<l>Wounds lose their Smart in such a glorious Cause:</l>
<l>He who for Interest, or for base Revenge,</l>
<l>Should in a private Quarrel sell his Foe,</l>
<l>Deserves the Scorn of every good Man for't;</l>
<l>But he who would enslave his native Land,</l>
<l>Give up the reverend Rights of Law and Justice,</l>
<l>To the detested Lust of boundless Tyranny,</l>
<l>Pollute our Altars, change our holy Worship,</l>
<l>Deserves the Curses both of Heaven and Earth,</l>
<l>And, from Society of human Kind,</l>
<l>To be cast forth among the Beasts of Prey,</l>
<l>A Monster far more savage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ante.</speaker>
<l>Excellent!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>For me—</l>
<l>I know no Glory, but my Country's Good,</l>
<l>Nor Anger bear 'gainst any, but her Foes;</l>
<l>But all her Enemies are mine; for her</l>
<l>I'd make this Body one entire Scar,</l>
<l>Ere I would see my Country made a Prey,</l>
<l>Or know the King, to whom I've sworn, distress'd;</l>
<l>And this I hold to be all brave Mens Duty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ante.</speaker>
<l>Matchless Stupidity!—</l>
<l>Art thou from me, from my strong Blood deriv'd,</l>
<l>And can thy ebbing Pulses beat so low,</l>
<l>So distant from the Vigour of my Soul?</l>
<l>But, Spite of Artifice, I see quite thro' thee;</l>
<l>Ill dost thou hide from me the hated Cause</l>
<l>Of this tame Suffering, this Bastard Patience.</l>
<l>Deaf to Ambition, foolish Love betrays thee.</l>
<l><hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Sister, <hi>Antimora</hi> reigns</l>
<l>The pow'rful Mistress o'er thy Heart and Fame;</l>
<l>Thy easy Mind, fond of the slavish Yoke,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="14"/>
Forgets her haughty Brother soars above thee.</l>
<l>I bad thee lift thine Eyes to <hi>Leonora,</hi></l>
<l>The beauteous Hope of this fair Kingdom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>Yes, that guilty Thought of yours undid me.</l>
<l>Oh! was it not, that finding your Ambition,</l>
<l>The angry King, to scatter all your Hopes,</l>
<l>Ruin'd guiltless me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ante.</speaker>
<l>Well, I remember his ungrateful Rage,</l>
<l>Remember it with just Indignation;</l>
<l>And thou as soon might'st think to reconcile</l>
<l>Th' eternal Quarrel between Death and Nature,</l>
<l>As quench my eager Thirst of Vengeance.</l>
<l>Yet I dissembled well my Injuries,</l>
<l>And sooth'd the fiery King with so much Art,</l>
<l>The bold Proposal was mistook for Zeal,</l>
<l>To keep the beauteous <hi>Leonora</hi> with us.</l>
<l>'Twas thus the Monarch's Favour I regain'd,</l>
<l>His wanting this experienc'd Head for Council.</l>
<l>When that old Sophister <hi>Alcanor</hi> dy'd,</l>
<l>I rose again prime Minister of State;</l>
<l>And now have in my View a brave Design,</l>
<l>Of which thou art unworthy to partake.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>My Want of Merit is my Pride in this;</l>
<l>For where Revenge and Fraud are of the Party,</l>
<l>I would not be admitted—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ante.</speaker>
<l>You wou'd not, Sir—</l>
<l>But tho' Crowns and Pow'r want Charms to move thee,</l>
<l>And Injury seems to have lost her pointed Sting;</l>
<l>When thou shalt know that <hi>Antimora</hi>'s given,</l>
<l>A Pledge of Friendship, from her Brother's Hand,</l>
<l>To his dear Fav'rite and Fellow-Warrior,</l>
<l>I know thy Spirits will be all awake.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>Ha!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ante.</speaker>
<l>Yes, that dang'rous Maid, who has misled thee,</l>
<l>For whom all filial Duty is forgot,</l>
<l>All Wrongs forgiven, all Ambition quench'd,</l>
<l>Must be <hi>Cardono</hi>'s Wife—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>I know <hi>Lorenzo</hi> loves the Man you mention;</l>
<l>But that he is to wed fair <hi>Antimora,</hi></l>
<l>Is all a Dream, work'd up by waking Malice.</l>
<l>The Souls of Martyrs, mounting from the Flame,</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="15"/>
Are not more brightly spotless, than her Faith;</l>
<l>But you have Leave to say whate'er you please,</l>
<l>And I, unruffl'd, will with Calmness hear you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ante.</speaker>
<l>Go on, young Stoick, bless these Pair of Friends;</l>
<l>Go, bend thy Knee to this young Fav'rite low;</l>
<l>Resign thy Mistress to the other's Arms,</l>
<l>And be renown'd for Patience!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>When I do that, let Infamy and Shame</l>
<l>Pursue and blot the Name of Soldier from me.</l>
<l>Give up my Mistress, quit the Maid I love!</l>
<l>As soon I would give up my Post in War,</l>
<l>Resign the Soul which animates this Frame,</l>
<l>And to that latest Nothing be reduc'd,</l>
<l>Where Love and Glory cease—But oh! I rave;</l>
<l>Her Brother's Pow'r, no, not the King's Command,</l>
<l>Can shock her Faith—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ante.</speaker>
<l>Build not thy Hopes upon a Woman's Faith,</l>
<l>But join with me, and greatly be reveng'd.</l>
<l>I have the Means, <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s in my Snare;</l>
<l>Deep as the Grave I've trac'd his erring Steps,</l>
<l>And seen him safe within the Toils of Fate;</l>
<l>Once more I warn thee to throw off thy Love;</l>
<l>Wake from this idle Amorous Lethargy,</l>
<l>And shun that falling House, like Loss of Honour;</l>
<l>Exert thy Soul, and aid my great Design,</l>
<l>Or from this Moment thou'rt no more my Son. <stage>[Ex.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>Wou'd I indeed were not, unhappy Thought. <stage>[Enter <hi>Agonistus.</hi>]</stage></l>
<l>My <hi>Agonistus</hi>—</l>
<l>Oh! much I wanted thee, and thou art come</l>
<l>Even to share Misfortunes with thy Friend.</l>
<l>Thou kind, thou best Companion of my Youth;</l>
<l>Thou Partner in my Dangers, well I know thee.</l>
<l>Should Father, King, and ev'ry Star frown on me,</l>
<l>Thou would'st not forsake me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<l>Much sooner shall this fertile Kingdom change</l>
<l>Her happy pregnant Soil for sterile Sand,</l>
<l>Than I sorsake my Friend—Come, be not sad,</l>
<l>Thou wilt again regain thy Master's Favour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>Thou know'st me not—</l>
<l>Il' thou dost think I in the least regard</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="16"/>
Whom Fortune mounts upon her giddy Wheel,</l>
<l>Or o'er what Fav'rite she insulting drives:</l>
<l>A softer Care does all my Thoughts employ;</l>
<l>Love, <hi>Agonistus,</hi> is the fatal Source</l>
<l>From whence my Sorrows spring.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<l>I've guess'd it long,</l>
<l>But knew not to what Fair your Vows were paid.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>Now I will tell thee all th' important Story,</l>
<l>And ease my burthen'd Heart of half its Load.</l>
<l>Thou art well acquainted with that ancient Hate</l>
<l>Between <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Family and mine,</l>
<l>And must remember to have heard at least</l>
<l>His Grand-father, when over-power'd by Faction,</l>
<l>From Court exil'd, pass'd many Years in <hi>Venice;</hi></l>
<l>During which Time his Son, the Lord <hi>Alcanor,</hi></l>
<l>Marry'd a beautiful <hi>Venetian</hi> Lady,</l>
<l>And he had Issue by her this <hi>Lorenzo,</hi></l>
<l>And <hi>Antimora,</hi> of whom she dy'd in Child-bed.</l>
<l>Soon after this, his Father also dy'd.</l>
<l><hi>Alcanor</hi> strait employ'd his Friends, t' obtain</l>
<l>Leave from the King for his Return to <hi>Lombardy.</hi></l>
<l>The King gave Leave; he came, and liv'd obscurely,</l>
<l>In sullen Solitude, and haughty Privacy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<l>I do remember to have heard this Story.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>In a lone ancient Seat <hi>Alcanor</hi> liv'd,</l>
<l>Hard by a Castle which belong'd to us;</l>
<l>'Twas there I first beheld fair <hi>Antimora,</hi></l>
<l>And, gazing, catch'd and gather'd growing Love.</l>
<l>Bright as a <hi>Sylvan</hi> Goddess she appear'd,</l>
<l>And shot her beauteous Beams into my Soul.</l>
<l>In some Disguise I waited every Day,</l>
<l>'Till in one happy Ev'ning I at last</l>
<l>Met her as she was walking forth alone;</l>
<l>With trembling Awe I ventur'd to approach her,</l>
<l>And on my Knees I begg'd that she would hear</l>
<l>The truest Passion that e'er warm'd a Lover.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<l>And she consented—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>At first she heard with Caution, still objecting</l>
<l>Our Houses Hatred, and my prosp'rous Fate,</l>
<l>And charg'd me to suppress the growing Flame,</l>
<l>And fix my Choice on some more happy Maid,</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="17"/>
Whose ample Fortunes, and whose equal Merit,</l>
<l>Might vindicate my Love—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<l>Thus Minds, form'd truly great, bear up their Port.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>But still I press'd, and told the lovely Fair one</l>
<l>My wakeful restless Agonies of Heart,</l>
<l>My eager Fondness, and my growing Fears,</l>
<l>The Pains of Doubt, and Horror of Despair,</l>
<l>With every Care which racks a Lover's Breast.</l>
<l>At length the Ardor of my servent Vows</l>
<l>Drew from her snowy Bosom, unawares,</l>
<l>A pitying Sigh, and from her Eyes a Tear,</l>
<l>The rich Reward of many anxious Minutes.</l>
<l>At last she spoke, and bless'd me with this Promise;</l>
<l>If there be yet a smiling Hour behind,</l>
<l>That shall the Grandeur of our House restore;</l>
<l>You, who have lov'd me in this Ebb of Fortune,</l>
<l>Shall find a grateful Sense in <hi>Antimora.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<l>She is indeed a Miracle of Goodness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>She gave me Leave to see her every Day;</l>
<l>But soon, alas! my Father's waking Jealousy</l>
<l>Discover'd where my constant Vows were paid,</l>
<l>And urg'd the King I might be sent Abroad.</l>
<l>The <hi>Turkish</hi> War concluded just before,</l>
<l>And <hi>Lombardy</hi> was by this Arm in Peace;</l>
<l>And 'cause no warlike Expedition offer'd,</l>
<l>I bore a peaceful Embassy to <hi>Rome.</hi></l>
<l>Before I went, I saw the lovely Maid,</l>
<l>And told her all the Cunning of my Father,</l>
<l>With all the Trouble of my Soul at Parting.</l>
<l>She bid me go, and said it was my Duty</l>
<l>To serve my King in Peace, as well as War;</l>
<l>Then breath'd a Sigh, and promis'd to be faithful.</l>
<l>'Twas thus we parted. Soon after I was gone,</l>
<l>Oh, <hi>Agonistus!</hi> fain I would forget it,</l>
<l>My Father all our Letters intercepted;</l>
<l>And, blinded with the daz'ling Lustre of a Throne,</l>
<l>Rais'd his ambitious Thoughts to <hi>Leonora,</hi></l>
<l>And dar'd to ask her for my Services.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<l>Unlucky Thought!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>Oh! most abhorr'd Ambition!</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="18"/>
For this my Father was displac'd from Court,</l>
<l>And Lord <hi>Alcanor</hi> grew again in Favour.</l>
<l>The <hi>Tuscan</hi> War about that Time broke out,</l>
<l>When this <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> this young Rival-Warrior,</l>
<l>Had first the Honour to command our Forces;</l>
<l>He rose in Favour, whilst I set in Shame.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<l>Swiftly he rose, as if the Goddess <hi>Fortune</hi></l>
<l>Became enamour'd with his many Graces;</l>
<l>No sooner seen, but all her Smiles were on him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>For this I was recall'd, disgrac'd, upbraided, ruin'd,</l>
<l>And banish'd from the Sight of <hi>Antimora;</hi></l>
<l>Beneath her Window, wet with baleful Dew,</l>
<l>All Night I lay, and told each Star my Grief.</l>
<l>She prais'd my Change, confess'd the Prince's Charms,</l>
<l>And all Access deny'd to wretched me;</l>
<l>'Till Love, long tortur'd on the Rack of Grief,</l>
<l>Convinc'd her of my much-wrong'd Innocence;</l>
<l>She smil'd, and bid me hope a better Day;</l>
<l>But oh! what Day can I expect to see,</l>
<l>If what my Father told me now be true?</l>
<l><hi>Cardono</hi> weds the beauteous <hi>Antimora;</hi></l>
<l>But haste, my Friend, tell her <hi>Learchus</hi> dies,</l>
<l>When e'er she makes that hated Rival happy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<l>I fly; but see the Friends appear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>Ha! how quick my Spirits move; I'm all on Fire;</l>
<l>What head-strong Rage does Jealousy inspire?</l>
<l>This is the Court, safe from unhallow'd Strife;</l>
<l>When next we meet, guard well that hated Life;</l>
<l>Thou shalt dispute my <hi>Antimora</hi>'s Charms,</l>

<l>Oh, most Prophetick Thought!</l>
<l>Teach <hi>Antimora</hi> to beware it too;</l>

<l>My Hopes are center'd in that blooming Maid,</l>

<l>But if, by Chance, some one <hi>Learchus</hi> name,</l>
<l>A conscious Blush o'er-spreads her Face, and strait</l>
<l>She turns away, to hide the rising Joy.</l>

<l>To chace my Uncle from his Dukedom forth,</l>

<l>This happy Kingdom shall devolve on me,</l>
<l>I will defend it with my utmost Strength,</l>

<l>Do I accuse thee, <hi>Leonora?</hi> No:</l>

<l>Do not I guard the Actions of my Life</l>
<l>With all that dutious Care which you directed?</l>
<l>Do I not wait my Royal Father's Will,</l>
<l>Deny Access to all the shining Court?</l>
<l>Except in publick, and by your Command,</l>
<l>I never see the Heroes of our Age.</l>

<l>They can, tho' all the Curtains of the Night</l>
<l>Be drawn, and solemn Darkness reigns around,</l>
<l>Discover every Action of their Court.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>'Tis so! and we are certainly undone.</l>

<l>In a most hideous, most gigantick Form,</l>
<l>To fright the World from thy Society;</l>
<l>From thy own Bowels spin the pois'nous Thread,</l>
<l>That may entangle Innocence and Honour:</l>

<l>Against the humblest Servant of his Will,</l>
<l>And threatens to destroy me?</l>
</sp>

<l>If what thou hast declar'd, be honest Truth,</l>
<l>Thou can'st not fear, thou hast a King thy Guard;</l>

<l>Thou seest she does defy thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Her Passion shows her Guiltiness the more;</l>
<l>It is the Nature of the Sex to do it:</l>
<l>They think to screen their Faults with empty Clamour,</l>
<l>And stop our just Resentments with their Noise;</l>
<l>But if your Majesty discover'd ought</l>
<l>That may instruct her to prevent our Purpose,</l>
<l>Then I must fall a Sacrifice indeed.</l>

<l>His cruel Nature never will forgive,</l>
<l>Nor will my Brother bear to hear his Name;</l>
<l>But what is worse, far worse than that, this Day</l>
<l>He has commanded me to love his Friend;</l>
<l>And, Spight of all Objections I can make,</l>
<l>He grows, like Fate, inexorable.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Lear.</speaker>
<l>Oh! <hi>Antimora!</hi> Love's become enrag'd</l>
<l>At thy too tedious, thy too long Delay,</l>

<l>Forget by whom my Glories all are sully'd;</l>

<l>You see I faint not; then proceed, I pray,</l>
<l>Tell me, come tell me how my Husband fell;</l>
<l>For all my Senses are to Hearing turn'd,</l>

<l>But thou'rt his Foe, and will not do him Justice,</l>

<l>This Task, this hateful Task, was not my Choice,</l>

<l>May Truth forsake my Soul, and Speech my Tongue;</l>
<l>The vital Blood that circles in my Veins,</l>
<l>Congeal to Ice, and stop the Springs of Life.</l>

And your <hi>Idea</hi> open'd Heav'n before him.</l>

<l>Having receiv'd my Orders to depart,</l>
<l>I met a Hermit, who call'd me by my Name,</l>

<l>Then bad me enter holy Orders strait,</l>
<l>And expiate my Sins in fervent Prayer.</l>
<l>Full twenty Years, if this I well perform'd,</l>
<l>My Son, he said, should wear a Regal Crown,</l>

<l>Bound by the Duty of a Sister's Love; <stage>[Enter <hi>Antimora.</hi></stage></l>
<l>And oh! I wish I cou'd produce <hi>Cardono!</hi></l>

<l>Oh my ravish'd Senses! tho' I no more</l>
<l>Must call you Brother, yet methinks I feel</l>
<l>The same transporting Joy for your Deliverance,</l>
<l>As if you truly were my Brother.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<l>Thou still shalt be my Sister, lovely Maid;</l>
<l>And the same fond tender Care I'll pay thee;</l>
<l>And wish I really were thy Brother now,</l>

<l>If my Delay of Duty had displeas'd,</l>
<l>I would have offer'd up my self, great Sir,</l>
<l>And dy'd, to expiate my honest Fault.</l>
<l>Your Pardon, Royal Madam's what I want,</l>
<l>For all the Grief which I have caus'd in you.</l>
<l>I had no gentler Means to save <hi>Lorenzo,</hi></l>
<l>But by appearing to obey the King.</l>
<l>I us'd the Heart of him <hi>Cardono</hi> stabb'd,</l>
<l>To work my End, and raise a Father's Pity,</l>
<l>Hoping your real Distress might move the King,</l>
<l>And wake Repentance in his Royal Soul.</l>
<l>My Plot succeeded, and I'm happy in it.</l>

<l>Let tender Maids, that feel the Force of Love,</l>
<l>For ever bless, and ever praise thy Name.</l>
<l>May'st thou n'er ask of Heaven or Man a Boon,</l>
<l>But may it be with double Portion granted.</l>
<l>Come to my Breast, thou Partner in my Grief,</l>

<l>Let this fair Virgin recompence thy Loss,</l>
<l>While all thy Father's Honours live again;</l>
<l>And with a better Grace adorn thy Brow.</l>

<l>But oh! be warn'd by his unhappy Fate,</l>
<l>What Dangers on the doubling Statesman wait!</l>
<l>Had he preferr'd his King's and Country's Good,</l>
<l>This publick Vengeance had not sought his Blood;</l>
<l>But while the secret Paths of Guilt he treads,</l>
<l>Where Lust of Power, Revenge, or Envy leads,</l>
<l>While to Ambition's lawless Height he flies,</l>
<l>Hated he lives, and unlamented dies.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<head type="sub"><stage>Spoken by Mrs. OLDFIELD.</stage></head>

<lg>
<l>WELL,—'twas a narrow 'Scape my <hi>Lover</hi> made;</l>
<l>That <hi>Cup</hi> and <hi>Message</hi>—I was sore afraid—</l>
<l>Was that a <hi>Present</hi> for a new made <hi>Widow,</hi></l>
<l>All in her dismal Dumps, like doleful <hi>DIDO!</hi></l>
<l>When one peep'd in—and hop'd for something good,</l>
<l>There was—oh! <hi>Gad!</hi> a nasty <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi></l>
<l>If the old Man had shew'd himself a Father,</l>
<l>His <hi>Bowl</hi> shou'd have inclos'd a <hi>Cordial</hi> rather,</l>
<l>Something to chear me up amidst my Trance,</l>
<l><hi>L' Eau de Barbadè</hi>—or comfortable <hi>Nants!</hi></l>
<l>He thought he paid it off with being smart,</l>
<l>And to be witty, cry'd, he'd send the <hi>Heart.</hi></l>
<l>I cou'd have told his Gravity, moreover,</l>
<l>Were I our Sex's Secrets to discover,</l>
<l>'Tis what we never look for in a <hi>Lover.</hi></l>
<l>Let but the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> prudently provide</l>
<l>All other <hi>Matters</hi> fitting for a <hi>Bride,</hi></l>
<l><pb facs="77"/>
So he make good the <hi>Jewels</hi> and the <hi>Jointure,</hi></l>
<l>To miss the <hi>Heart,</hi> does seldom disappoint her.</l>
<l>Faith, for the Fashion <hi>Hearts</hi> of <hi>late</hi> are made in,</l>
<l>They are the vilest <hi>Bawbles</hi> we can trade in.</l>
<l>Where are the tough brave BRITONS to be found,</l>
<l>With <hi>Hearts</hi> of <hi>Oak,</hi> so much of Old renown'd?</l>
<l>How many worthy Gentlemen of late</l>
<l>Swore to be true to <hi>Mother-Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi></l>
<l>When their <hi>false Hearts</hi> were secretly maintaining</l>
<l>Yon trim King PEPIN, at <hi>Avignon</hi> reigning?</l>
<l>Shame on the canting Crew of <hi>Soul-Insurers,</hi></l>
<l>That <hi>Tyburn-Tribe</hi> of <hi>Speech-making Non-jurors;</hi></l>
<l>Who in new-frangled <hi>Terms,</hi> old <hi>Truth</hi>'s explaining,</l>
<l>Teach honest <hi>English-men,</hi> damn'd <hi>Double Meaning.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Oh! wou'd you lost Integrity restore,</l>
<l>And boast that <hi>Faith</hi> your plain Fore-Fathers bore;</l>
<l>What surer Pattern can you hope to find,</l>
<l>Than that dear PLEDGE your MONARCH left behind!</l>
<l>See how his <hi>Looks</hi> his <hi>honest Heart</hi> explain,</l>
<l>And speak the Blessings of his <hi>future Reign!</hi></l>
<l>In his each Feature, Truth, and Candour trace,</l>
<l>And read <hi>Plain Dealing</hi> written in his <hi>Face,</hi></l>
