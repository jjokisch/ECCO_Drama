<head>TO LADY VISCOUNTESS NUNEHAM.</head>
<opener><salute>MADAM,</salute></opener>
<p>I HAVE many reasons to be flattered with the public reception of this Tragedy, yet I confess my solicitude for its reputation extends further.</p>
<p>Your Ladyship's having permitted me the honour of inscribing it to you, will in some measure gratify my ambition by recommending it to the reader, whose judgment is not influenced by the adventitious assistance of theatrical decorations and the graces of action.</p>
<p>Where your Ladyship's name appears as a patroness, merit will be expected; and where there is a wish to find any, probably none will pass unnoticed.</p>
<p><pb n="iv" facs="3"/>Whatever motive may be assigned for this Address, my principal purpose will be fully answered if your Ladyship accepts it, as a testimony of my gratitude for the favours I have received from the Noble Family to which you are so happily united, and of the perfect esteem and respect of</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by ARTHUR MURPHY, Esq.</byline>
<byline>SPOKEN BY MR. PALMER.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>WHILE in these days of sentiment and grace</l>
<l>Poor comedy in tears resigns her place,</l>
<l>And smit with novels, full of maxims crude,</l>
<l>She, that was frolick once, now turns a prude;</l>
<l>To her great end the tragic muse aspires,</l>
<l>At Athens born, and faithful to her sires.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The comic sister in hysteric fit,</l>
<l>You'd swear, has lost all memory of wit.</l>
<l>Folly, for her, may now exult on high;</l>
<l>Feather'd by ridicule no arrows fly;</l>
<l>But if you are distress'd, she's sure to cry.</l>
<l>She that could jig, and nick-name all heav'n's creatures,</l>
<l>With sorrows not her own deforms her features;</l>
<l>With stale reflections keeps a constant pother;</l>
<l>Greece gave her one face, and she makes another;</l>
<l>So very pious, and so full of woe,</l>
<l>You well may bid her "To a nunnery go."</l>
<l>Not so Melpomene; to nature true</l>
<l>She holds her own great principle in view.</l>
<l>She, from the first, when men her pow'r confest,</l>
<l>When grief and terror seiz'd the tortur'd breast,</l>
<l>She made, to strike her moral to the mind,</l>
<l>The stage the great tribunal of mankind.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Hither the worthies of each clime she draws,</l>
<l>Who founded states, or rescued dying laws;</l>
<l>Who, in base times, a life of glory led,</l>
<l>And for their country who have toil'd or bled;</l>
<l>Hither they come, again they breathe, they live,</l>
<l>And virtue's meed through ev'ry age receive.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Hither the murd'rer comes, with ghastly mien!</l>
<l>And the fiend conscience hunts him o'er the scene.</l>
<l>None are exempted; all must re-appear,</l>
<l>And even kings attend for judgement here;</l>
<l>Here find the day, when they their pow'r abuse,</l>
<l>Is a scene furnish'd to the tragic muse.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="5"/>
<l>Such is her art, weaken'd perhaps at length,</l>
<l>And, while she aims at beauty, losing strength.</l>
<l>Oh! when resuming all her native rage,</l>
<l>Shall her true energy alarm the stage?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>This night a bard—(our hopes may rise too high,</l>
<l>'Tis yours to judge;—'tis yours the cause to try)</l>
<l>This night a bard, as yet unknown to fame,</l>
<l>Once more, we hope, will rouze the genuine flame.</l>
<l>His; no French play;— tame, polish'd, dull by rule!</l>
<l>Vigorous he comes, and warm from Shakespeare's school.</l>
<l>Inspir'd by him, he shews, in glaring light,</l>
<l>A nation struggling with tyrannic might;</l>
<l>Oppression rushing on with giant strides;</l>
<l>A deep conspiracy, which virtue guides;</l>
<l>Heroes, for freedom who dare strike the blow,</l>
<l>A tablature of honour, guilt and woe.</l>
<l>If on his canvass nature's colours shine,</l>
<l>You'll praise the hand that trac'd the just design.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>By a FRIEND.</byline>
<byline>SPOKEN BY MRS. YATES.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>IS it permitted in this age severe,</l>
<l>For female softness to demand a tear?</l>
<l>Is it allow'd in such censorious days,</l>
<l>For female virtue to solicit praise?</l>
<l>Dares manly sense, beneath a tender form,</l>
<l>Presume to dictate, and aspire to warm?</l>
<l>May so unnatural a being venture</l>
<l>As a true heroine on the stage to enter?</l>
<l>No, says a wit, made up of French grimaces,</l>
<l>Yet self-ordain'd the high-priest of the graces.</l>
<l>Women are play-things for our idle hours,</l>
<l>Their souls unfinish'd, and confin'd their pow'rs;</l>
<l>Loquacious, vain, by slight attentions won,</l>
<l>By flattery gain'd, and by untruths undone.</l>
<l>Or should some grave great plan engage their minds,</l>
<l>The first caprice can give it to the winds;</l>
<l>And the chief stateswoman of all the sex</l>
<l>Grows nervous, if a fop or pimple vex.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Injurious slanders!—in Louisa's air</l>
<l>Behold th' exemplar of a perfect fair;</l>
<l>Just, tho' aspiring; merciful, tho' brave;</l>
<l>Sincere, tho' politic; and tho' fond, no slave;</l>
<l>In danger calm, and smiling in success,</l>
<l>But as securing ampler means to bless.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Nor think, as Zeuxis, for a faultless piece,</l>
<l>Cull'd various charms from various nymphs of Greece,</l>
<l>Our bard has center'd in one beauteous whole,</l>
<l>The rays that gleam thro' many a separate soul.</l>
<l>On Britain's and Ierne's shores he saw</l>
<l>The models of the fair he dar'd to draw;</l>
<l>True virtue in these isles has fix'd her throne,</l>
<l>And many a bright Louisa is our own.</l>

<l>O good Ribiro, what have we deserved,</l>

<l>What deserved!</l>

<l>The little all our industry had earn'd,</l>

<l>May we indeed expect—</l>

<l>Was that a fight for Lisbon?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEMOS.</speaker>
<l>O shame! shame!</l>
<l>What crime cou'd they commit?—Old, helpless, plunder'd—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>—Even thoughts are crimes in this distemper'd state.</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="10"/>They once had wealth as you have—Spain thought meet</l>
<l>To seize it—They (rash men) have dar'd to murmur.</l>
<l>Velasquez here—our scourge—King Philip's idol,</l>
<l>Whom Portugal must bow to—mildly dooms them,</l>
<l>But to perpetual bondage for this treason.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEMOS.</speaker>
<l>We must be patient—'Tis a cureless evil.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Is patience then the only virtue left us?</l>
<l>Come, come, there is a remedy more manly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COREA.</speaker>
<l>Wou'd it were in our reach!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Look here, I grasp it.</l>
<stage>Laying his hand on his sword.</stage>
<l>What turned to statues! — Hence enfranchisement</l>
<l>If the quick fire that lately warm'd your breasts,</l>
<l>Already wastes to embers.—Am I rash?</l>
<l>We touch'd this theme before—You felt it then.</l>
<l>Wou'd I cou'd put a tongue in every ingot,</l>
<l>That now lies pil'd within your massy stores—</l>
<l>Your gold perhaps might move you—Spain will seize it,</l>
<l>Then bid you mourn the loss in the next dungeon,</l>
<l>Or dig her mines for more—Is't not enough?—</l>
<l>Instruct me, Lemos, you, good Corea, teach me</l>
<l>This meekness so convenient to our foes,</l>
<l>Or pierce this swelling bosom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEMOS.</speaker>
<l>Who can teach it?</l>
<l>'Tis not in art Ribiro—Know us better.</l>
<l>The canker discontent consumes within,</l>
<l>And mocks our smooth exterior.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COREA.</speaker>
<l>Hear me for both:</l>
<l>For all th' indignant hearts in Portugal—</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="11"/>If curses sped like plagues and pestilence,</l>
<l>Thus wou'd I strike them at the towers of Spain.</l>
<l>May her swoln pride burst like an empty bubble?</l>
<l>Distraction rend her councils, route and shame</l>
<l>Pursue her flying squadrons—Tempests scatter</l>
<l>And whirlpools swallow up her full man'd navies!</l>
<l>Bold insurrection spread thro' all her states,</l>
<l>Shaking like pent-up winds their loose allegiance!</l>
<l>All Europe arm, and every frowning king,</l>
<l>Point at one foe, and let that foe be Spain!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>O be that curse prophetic!—Here 'tis dangerous,</l>
<l>Nor will the time allow to tell you all.</l>
<l>But thus far rest assured; — I speak not rashly —</l>
<l>A project is on foot, and now just rip'ning,</l>
<l>Will give our indignation nobler scope,</l>
<l>Than tears or curses (priests and womens weapons.)</l>
<l>All that secures the event of great designs,</l>
<l>Sage heads, firm hearts, and executing arms,</l>
<l>In formidable union league with us,</l>
<l>And chain capricious fortune to our standard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEMOS.</speaker>
<l>Say, can our aid promote this glorious cause?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>All private virtue is the public fund:</l>
<l>As that abounds, the state decays, or thrives;</l>
<l>Each shou'd contribute to the general stock,</l>
<l>And who lends most, is most his country's friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEMOS.</speaker>
<l>O wou'd Braganza meet the people's wish!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>He is not yet resolved,—but may be won—</l>
<l>Cou'd I assure him men like you but wish'd it,</l>
<l>(For well he knows and loves you) — Trust me, Lemos!</l>
<l>It wou'd do more to knit him to this cause,</l>
<l>Than legions of our hot nobility.</l>

<speaker>COREA.</speaker>
<l>We love his virtue—will support his rights—</l>

<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Then shew it by your deeds.—Your artizans</l>
<l>Are prompt, bold, hardy, fond of violence.</l>
<l>Alarm their slumb'ring courage, rouse their rage,</l>
<l>Wake their dulled senses to the shame and scorn</l>
<l>That hisses in the ears of willing bondmen;</l>
<l>If they will hazard one bold stroke for freedom,</l>
<l>A leader shall be found, a brave—a just one.</l>
<l>Anon expect me where the ivied arch</l>
<l>Rears the bold image of our late Braganza.</l>
<l>In sullen discontent he seems to frown</l>
<l>As if still hostile to the foes of Lisbon.</l>
<l>There we'll discourse at large—Almada comes—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEMOS.</speaker>
<l>Is he a friend?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>A firm one—No dishonour</l>
<l>E'er bow'd that rev'rend head—That mighty spirit</l>
<l>When first the oppressor, like a flood, o'erwhelm'd us,</l>
<l>Rear'd high his country's standard and defied him.</l>
<l>—He comes to seek me—Lose no time—Remember.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt Lemos and Corea.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO</speaker>
<stage>alone.</stage>
<l>I shou'd detest my zeal, cou'd it be stir'd</l>
<l>Against the wholesome rigour of restraint</l>
<l>Licentiousness made needful—But good Heaven!</l>
<l>Foul murders unprovok'd, delib'rate cruelty—</l>
<l>—The God within us must rise up against it.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ALMADA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Well met Ribiro—What new proselytes?</l>
<l>Thy ardor every hour, or finds, or makes them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="13"/>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>No—thank the Spaniards for our proselytes—</l>
<l>Scarce half an hour ago, two citizens</l>
<l>(My blood still boils) by fell Velasquez order</l>
<l>Were drag'd to prison—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Spare my soul, Ribiro,</l>
<l>Superfluous detestation of that villain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Knowing this way they were to pass, I brought</l>
<l>Lemos and Corea (whom last night I founded)</l>
<l>That their own eyes might see the outrages,</l>
<l>Men of their order must expect to meet</l>
<l>From power that knows no bounds, and owns no law.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>'Twas wisely done; for minds of coarse alloy</l>
<l>But bluntly feel the touch of others wrongs,</l>
<l>Tho' deep they take the impression of their own.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>By heav'n their fury bore a nobler stamp;</l>
<l>Their honest rage glow'd on their kindling cheeks,</l>
<l>Broke thro' the cold restraints of coward caution,</l>
<l>And swell'd even to an eloquence of anger.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>'Tis well—But are they yet inform'd how near</l>
<l>Th' approaching hour, decisive of our fate,</l>
<l>That gives us death or freedom—that the dawn—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Not yet —They still believe the Duke at noon</l>
<l>But visits Lisbon to command the march</l>
<l>Of our new levies, to the Spanish bounds;</l>
<l>Himself to follow streight—Ere then I mean</l>
<l>Again to see them, and still more to whet</l>
<l>The keeness of their hate against our tyrants.</l>
<l>—At least a thousand follow where they lead—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="14"/>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Their boldness well directed may do much.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>That care be mine—I've studied—and I know them;</l>
<l>Inconstant, sanguine, easily inflam'd,</l>
<l>But like the nitrous powder uncompress'd,</l>
<l>Consuming by the blaze nought but itself.</l>
<l>'Tis ours to charge the mine with deadly skill,</l>
<l>And bury usurpation in the ruin.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>I think we cannot fail—Our friends are firm.</l>
<l>Honour will bind the noble—Hope the weak,</l>
<l>And common interest all—The insulting Spaniard</l>
<l>Broods over embryo mischiefs, nor suspects</l>
<l>The wretched worm conceals a mortal sting</l>
<l>To pierce the haughty heel that tramples him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>How great will be our triumph, Spain's disgrace,</l>
<l>When ev'ry mischief that perfidious court</l>
<l>Has fram'd against Braganza's precious life,</l>
<l>Recoils on the contriver!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Urge that home;</l>
<l>Urge how the Duke's affection to his country,</l>
<l>His right unquestionable to her crown,</l>
<l>First mark'd him for the victim of false Spain;</l>
<l>That his commission as high admiral,</l>
<l>His general's staff, and all the lofty pomp</l>
<l>Of his high sounding titles, were but meant</l>
<l>As gilded snares to invite him to his death.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>These truths, shameful to Philip, must be told;</l>

<l>Seizes the bright reversion of our hopes.</l>
<l>I see the genius of our realm restor'd,</l>
<l>And smiling lead him to his rightful throne.</l>
<l>No wild ambition, like a pamper'd steed,</l>
<l>O'erleaps the boundaries of law and reason,</l>
<l>And tramples every seed of social virtue:</l>

<l>Combin'd our force, and methodized our vengeance.</l>
<l>Taught us that ends which seem impossible</l>
<l>Are lost, or compass'd only by the means;</l>
<l>That fortune is a false divinity,</l>
<l>But folly worships what the wise man makes.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>A Moment's pause, Mendoza! here appointed</l>
<l>By promise to the Duke at noon to wait him,</l>
<l>I could not mingle with his followers,</l>
<l>So saw it but in part—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>The air still rings</l>
<l>With loudest acclamations.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Yes, Mendoza;</l>
<l>With joy I heard them—heard the vaulted sky</l>
<l>Echo Braganza.—'Twas no hireling noise,</l>
<l>No faction's roar of mercenary joy,</l>
<l>Sound without transport—but the heart-felt cry</l>
<l>Of a whole nation's welcome. Hear it Spain!</l>
<l>Proud usurpation hear it!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>The whole way</l>
<l>Was cover'd thick with panting multitudes,</l>
<l>That scarce left passage for their chariot wheels;</l>
<l>The trees were bent with people; ev'ry roof,</l>
<l>Dome, temple, portico, so closely fill'd,</l>
<l>The gazers made the wonder. Here and there</l>
<l><pb n="14" facs="21"/>A discontented Spaniard stalk'd along</l>
<l>Should'ring the crowd; and with indignant scorn</l>
<l>Turn'd up his sallow cheek in mockery.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>We shall retort their scorn—Mark'd you the Duke?</l>
<l>His mind is ever letter'd in his face.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Pleasure was mingled with anxiety,</l>
<l>Both visible at once. But, O what words</l>
<l>Can paint the angel form that grac'd his side,</l>
<l>His bright Louisa! like th' Olympian Queen,</l>
<l>When o'er her fragrant bosom Venus bound</l>
<l>Th' enchanting Cestus—from her lucid eyes</l>
<l>Stream'd the pure beams of soft benevolence,</l>
<l>And glories more than mortal shone around her.</l>
<l>Harmonious sounds of dulcet instruments</l>
<l>Swell'd by the breath, or swept from tuneful wire,</l>
<l>Floated in air—while yellow Tagus burn'd</l>
<l>With prows of flaming gold; their painted flags</l>
<l>In gandy frolick fluttering to the breeze.</l>
<l>On to their palace thus the triumph came:</l>
<l>Alighted at the gate, the princely pair</l>
<l>Express'd their thanks in silent dignity</l>
<l>Of gesture, far more eloquent than words;</l>
<l>Then turn'd them from the throng—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Why this looks well.</l>
<l>The Duke will sure be rous'd to resolution</l>
<l>By this bright presage of his coming glory.</l>

<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>With grief I learn he still is undetermin'd.</l>
<l>His fears prevail against the public wish;</l>
<l>And thus the ill-pois'd scale of our fair hopes,</l>
<l>Mounts light and unsubstantial.</l>
</sp>

<pb n="15" facs="22"/>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>O you wrong him.</l>
<l>I know his noble nature—Juan's heart</l>
<l>Pants not with selfish fear—His wife, his friends,</l>
<l>An infant family, a kingdom's fate,</l>
<l>More than his own, besiege his struggling soul;</l>
<l>He must be more than man, who will not hear</l>
<l>Such powerful calls, and less, who can despise them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Indeed I cannot wonder he's disturb'd,</l>
<l>But doubts are treason in a cause like this.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Dismiss these fears—Louisa's gentle sway</l>
<l>Will fix him to our purpose. Night's chaste orb</l>
<l>Rules not the heavings of the restless tide,</l>
<l>More sure than she with mild ascendancy</l>
<l>Can govern all his ebbs and flows of passion.</l>
<l>But come, by this time the fond multitude</l>
<l>Have gaz'd away their longing, and retire.</l>
<l>Our greeting will be seasonable now.

<sp>
<speaker>VELASQUEZ.</speaker>
<l>With reason—dull Braganza</l>

<l>I practis'd every supple artifice</l>
<l>That glides into man's bosom—The return</l>
<l>Was blank reserve, ambiguous compliment,</l>
<l>And hatred thinly veil'd by ceremony.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PIZARRO.</speaker>
<l>Might I presume—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASQUEZ.</speaker>
<l>Pizarro, I am stung—</l>
<l>His father Theodosius, that proud Prince,</l>
<l>Who durst avow his enmity to Philip,</l>
<l>And menac'd thunders at my destin'd head,</l>
<l>With all his empty turbulence of rage</l>
<l>Cou'd never move me like the calm disdain</l>
<l>Of this cold blooded Juan.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="27" facs="34"/>
<speaker>PIZARRO.</speaker>
<l>Then, my Lord,</l>
<l>Your purpose holds.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASQUEZ.</speaker>
<l>It does—I will dispatch</l>
<l>This tow'ring Duke, who keeps the cheek of Spain</l>
<l>Pale with perpetual danger.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PIZARRO.</speaker>
<l>For what end?</l>
<l>Unconscious of his fate, he blindly speeds</l>
<l>To find a grave in Spain—Why then resolve</l>
<l>To spill that blood, which elsewhere will be shed</l>
<l>Without your crime or peril?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASQUEZ.</speaker>
<l>That's the question.</l>
<l>Were I assur'd they meant his death, 'twere needless:</l>
<l>But when they draw him once from Portugal,</l>
<l>Where only he is dangerous, then perhaps</l>
<l>Their fears, or lenity may let him live;</l>
<l>And while he lives, my fiery course is check'd,</l>
<l>My sun climbs slowly, never can ascend</l>
<l>To its meridian brightness.</l>

<speaker>VELASQUEZ.</speaker>
<l>—Think them little—</l>
<l>An earnest, not the acquittal of my love.</l>
<l>The enormous wealth of Juan's royal house,</l>
<l>His large domains, extended influence,</l>
<l>His numerous vassals so have swell'd his state,</l>
<l>That were his means but push'd to one great end;</l>
<l>How easy might he wrest this realm from Spain,</l>

<l>Good careless prince!</l>
<l>Mild and uxorious! No ambitious dream</l>
<l>Disturbs his tranquil slumber —</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASQUEZ.</speaker>
<l>Just his nature!</l>
<l>On household wing he flutters round the roof,</l>
<l>That with the princely eagle might have soar'd</l>
<l>And met the dazzling sun. Now by his death</l>
<l>(My engine cannot fail, this night he meets it)</l>
<l>His wealth, his mightiness, his followers</l>
<l>Become Louisa's dower—What think'st thou now?</l>
<l>Cou'd I but win her to accept my hand,</l>

<l>I'll scorn their idle fury.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>My hope rests</l>
<l>Even on that favourite passion—Grief at first</l>
<l>Will drive her far from love— A second flame</l>
<l>Perhaps may ne'er rekindle in her heart;</l>
<l>Yet, give her momentary frenzy scope,</l>
<l>It wastes itself; ambition then regains</l>

<l>Nay, trust me, cou'd they but divine my purpose,</l>
<l>The holiest he, that wastes the midnight lamp</l>
<l>In prayers and penance, wou'd prevent my tongue</l>
<l>And hear me thank the deed, but not persuade it.</l>

<l>To leave no taste, no wish ungratified.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Thus to meet, Antonio!</l>
<l>Is the best health, the soundness of the mind.</l>
<l>Better at this dark hour to embrace in arms</l>
<l>Thus girt for manly execution, friend!</l>
<l>Than in the mazes of the wanton dance,</l>
<l>Or revelling o'er bowls in frantic mirth,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<stage>(to Ribiro.)</stage>
<l>O soul of honour, ever, ever constant.</l>
<l>These are the worthy citizens, our friends—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<stage>(Presenting Lemos and Corea.)</stage>
<l>And such as laurell'd Rome might well have own'd</l>
<l><pb n="37" facs="44"/>Worthy to fill her magisterial chairs,</l>
<l>When reverence bow'd to virtue tho' untitled.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>As such I take their hands, nay more as such,</l>
<l>Their grateful country will rejoice to own them.</l>
<l>Are we all met?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>Mendoza is not here,</l>
<l>Nor Roderic, and Mello too is absent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>They were not wont to be thus waited for.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Anon they will be here,—mean time proceed,</l>
<l>They know their place already —</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Why we meet,</l>
<l>Is not to canvass our opprobrious wrongs,</l>
<l>But to redress them.—Yet as trumpets sound,</l>
<l>To rouse the soldier's ardor,—so the breath</l>
<l>Of our calamities will wake our fires,</l>
<l>And fan them to spread wide the flame of vengeance.</l>
<l>'Tis not my gift to play the orator,</l>
<l>But in plain words to lay our state before you.</l>
<l>—Our tyrant's grandsire, whose ambition claim'd,</l>
<l>And first usurp'd Braganza's royal rights,</l>
<l>My blood establish'd his detested sway.</l>
<l>Old Tagus blush'd with many a crimson tide,</l>
<l>Sluic'd from the noblest veins of Portugal.</l>
<l>The exterminating sword knew no distinction.</l>
<l>Princes, and prelates, venerable age,</l>
<l><pb n="38" facs="45"/>Matrons, and helpless virgins fell together,</l>
<l>'Till cloy'd and sick of slaughter, the tir'd soldier</l>
<l>With grim content flung down his reeking steel,</l>
<l>And glutted rage gave truce to massacre.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Nor pass'd the iron rod to milder hands</l>
<l>Thro' two succeeding reigns—With cruel zeal</l>
<l>The barbarous offspring emulate their sire,</l>
<l>And track his bloody footsteps in our ruin.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Now mark how happily the time conspires,</l>
<l>To give our great atchievement permanence;</l>
<l>—Spain is not what she was, when Europe bow'd</l>
<l>To the fifth Charles, and his degenerate son.</l>
<l>When, like a torrent swell'd by mountain floods,</l>
<l>She swept the neighbouring nations with her arms,</l>
<l>And threaten'd those remote,—contracted now</l>
<l>Within an humble bed, the thrifty urn,</l>
<l>Of her exhausted greatness, scarce can pour</l>
<l>A lazy tide thro' her own mould'ring states.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Yes the Colossus totters, every blast</l>
<l>Shakes the stupendous mass and threats its downfall.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> MENDOZA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Break off—break off—the fatal snare is spread,</l>
<l>And death's pale hand assists to close the toil.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Whence this dread greeting?—Ha—thy alter'd cheek</l>
<l>Wears not the ensign of this glowing hour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="39" facs="46"/>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>The scream of night owls, or the ravens croak</l>
<l>Wou'd better suit the baleful news I bring,</l>
<l>Than the known accents of a friendly voice.</l>
<l>—We are undone—betray'd—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Say'st thou—betray'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Our tower is sap'd—the high rais'd fabric falls</l>
<l>To crush us with the ruin.—What avails</l>
<l>The full maturity of all our hopes?</l>
<l>This glorious league—the justice of our cause?—</l>
<l>—High Heaven might idly thunder on our side,</l>
<l>If traitors to ourselves.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Ourselves—Oh shame!</l>
<l>I'll not believe it — What perfidious slaves—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Two whom we thought the sinews of our strength,</l>
<l>Don Roderic and Mello.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Lightnings blast them!</l>
<l>May infamy record their dastard names,</l>
<l>And vulgar villains shun their fellowship—</l>
<l>These hot, loud brawlers—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Are the slaves of Spain,</l>
<l>And bargain for the price of perfidy.—</l>
<l>On to the wharf with quick impatient step,</l>
<l>I saw Velasquez press, and in his train</l>
<l><pb n="40" facs="47"/>These lurking traitors.—Now, even now, they cross</l>
<l>The ebbing Tagus in the tyrant's barge,</l>
<l>And hasten to the sort.—The troops of Spain,</l>
<l>Even while we speak, are summon'd to the charge,</l>
<l>And mark us for their prey.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Nay then, 'tis past.</l>
<l>Malignant fortune, when the cup was rais'd</l>
<l>Close to our lips, has dash'd it to the ground.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>This unexpected bolt strikes flat our hopes,</l>
<l>And leaves one dreary desolation round us.</l>
<l>I see their hangmen muster—wolf-ey'd cruelty,</l>
<l>Grimly sedate, glares o'er her iron hoard</l>
<l>Of racks, wheels, engines, feels her axe's edge</l>
<l>Licks her fell jaws, and with a monster's thirst,</l>
<l>Already drinks our blood.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>There's not a pang</l>
<l>That rends the fibres of man's feeling frame,</l>
<l>No vile disgrace, that even in thought o'er-spreads</l>
<l>The cheek with burning crimson, but her hate</l>
<l>Ingenious to devise, and sure to inflict</l>
<l>In keenest agony will make us suffer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Wou'd that were all—Our dismal scene must close;</l>
<l>Nature o'er power'd at length will leave her load,</l>
<l>And baffie persecution.—But O, Portugal!</l>
<l>Alass unhappy country! Where's the bourn</l>
<l>Can mark the extent of thy calamities.</l>
<l>Like winter's icy hand our luckless end</l>
<l>Will freeze the source of future enterprize:</l>
<l><pb n="41" facs="48"/>Oppression then o'er the devoted realm</l>
<l>Erect and bold will stalk with tenfold ravage.</l>
<l>There, there alone, this breast is vulnerable;</l>
<l>These are the wheels that wrench, the racks that tear me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>But are there left no means to elude the danger?</l>
<l>Why do we linger here?—Why not resolve</l>
<l>To save ourselves by flight?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Impossible!</l>
<l>The guards no doubt are set—the port is bar'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>Fly Lemos to the people, and restrain</l>
<l>Their generous ardor.—It wou'd now break forth</l>
<l>Useless to us, and fatal to themselves.
<stage>Exit Lemor.</stage></l>
<l>You to the Duke, Ribiro!—In our names,</l>
<l>(Perhaps our last request) by our lost fortunes,</l>
<l>By all our former friendship, O conjure him</l>
<l>To save our richest treasure from the wreck,</l>
<l>Nor hazard in a desperate enterprize</l>
<l>His country's last best hope, his valued life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Support him Heaven, and arm his piety</l>
<l>To bear this sad vicissitude with patience.
<stage>Exit Ribiro.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>And yet we will not meet in vain, brave friends;</l>
<l>We came with better hopes, resolv'd like men</l>
<l>To struggle for our freedom.—What remains?</l>
<l>A greater power than mortals can arraign,</l>
<l>Has otherwise decreed it.—Speak, my brothers,</l>
<l>Now doubly dear in stern adversity;</l>
<l>Say, shall we glut the spoiler with our blood,</l>
<l>Submit to the vile insults of their law,</l>
<l><pb n="42" facs="49"/>To have our honest dust by the ruffian hands</l>
<l>Given to the winds—Is this the doom that waits us?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Alas what better doom? To ask for mercy</l>
<l>Were ignominious, to expect it bootless.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMADA.</speaker>
<l>To ask for mercy—cou'd Spain stretch my life</l>
<l>To years beyond the telling, for one tear,</l>
<l>One word, in sign of sorrow, I'd disdain it.</l>
<l>Death still is in our pow'r—and we'll die nobly,</l>

<l>Thus, my lord,</l>
<l>When at the appointed time, our two brave friends</l>
<l>Were hast'ning to Almada, near the square,</l>
<l>Velasquez and his followers cross'd their steps,</l>
<l>Their course seem'd towards the river;—struck with fear,</l>
<l>And ignorant what cause at that late hour</l>
<l>Cou'd draw him from the palace; straight they chang'd</l>
<l>Their first intent of joining our assembly,</l>
<l>And unobserv'd pursu'd the attending train.</l>
<l><pb n="51" facs="58"/>Think what these brave men suffer'd when they saw</l>
<l>The tyrant climb his barge, and push from shore.</l>
<l>Their swords were half unsheath'd, both half resolv'd</l>
<l>To rush at once, and pierce him to the heart.</l>
<l>—But prudence, or our fortune check'd their hands.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<l>It had been certain ruin—but go on—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>An instant pass'd in thought, they seiz'd a boat,</l>
<l>And following, anxious hung on all his motions:</l>
<l>Mendoza saw them thus—then hurrying back,</l>
<l>Fill'd us with consternation at the tidings.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DUTCHESS.</speaker>
<l>Nor was it strange—it wore a dreadful aspect;</l>
<l>But fear interprets all things to its danger.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>He cross'd the river where Jago's fort</l>
<l>Commands the narrowing stream. The governor</l>
<l>Attended at the gate, a while there pass'd</l>
<l>In short but earnest converse, they took leave,</l>
<l>With hasty strides Velasquez reimbark'd;</l>
<l>The vessel, to the shore she left, return'd,</l>
<l>And her proud master sought again the palace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DUTCHESS.</speaker>
<l>Cou'd not our valiant friends discover ought</l>
<l>That might reveal his purpose?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIBIRO.</speaker>
<l>Madam—No.</l>
<l>To have enquir'd too near were dangerous</l>
<l>Besides, their haste to reassure our hopes</l>
<l>Press'd their return—But thus we may resolve:</l>
<l>He apprehends some danger imminent.</l>
<l><pb n="52" facs="59"/>He sees above his head the gathering cloud,</l>
<l>But knows not when 'twill burst in thunder on him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<l>Thanks, gentle friend—Alas, I tremble still;</l>
<l>As just escap'd from shipwreck, I look round,</l>
<l>And tho' I tread on earth,—firm, solid earth</l>
<l>See with broad eye the threatning surge far off,</l>
<l>Scarce can I credit my conflicting sense</l>
<l>Or trust our preservation—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DUTCHESS.</speaker>
<l>Thy glad tale</l>
<l>Has rais'd me from the gulph of black despair,</l>
<l>Even to the topmost pinnacle of joy.</l>
<l>Yes, we shall conquer— All these dangers past</l>
<l>Will serve but to enrich the future story.</l>
<l>Our children's children shall recount each fear,</l>
<l>And from the mingled texture of our lives,</l>
<l>Learn to revere that sacred Providence</l>
<l>That guides the strife of virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<l>O Louisa!</l>
<l>I thought I knew the extent of all my fondness,</l>
<l>That long acquaintance with thy wondrous virtue</l>
<l>Had given thee such dominion o'er my soul,</l>
<l>Time cou'd not add to my trascendent passion.</l>
<l>But when the danger came, it wak'd new fires,</l>
<l>Presented thee in softer loveliness,</l>
<l>And twin'd thee closer here.</l>

<l>Go my dearest Juan,</l>

<l>Merits more recompence than our poor thanks</l>
<l>Can at the best requite. For souls like theirs</l>

<speaker>DUTCHESS.</speaker>
<l>He returns</l>
<l>Unhurt, victorious to these happy arms?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>All, all your fondest wish cou'd form he brings,</l>
<l>Crown, conquest, all.—Oppression is no more,</l>
<l>Pierc'd by a thousand wounds the giant dies,</l>
<l>While free-born men with fearless gaze walk round,</l>
<l>And view the monster's bulk.</l>
</sp>

<l>The fall of many friends?</l>
</sp>

<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Scarce one of note</l>
<l>But lives to share our joy.—The regent seiz'd,</l>
<l>Gave orders for the citadel's surrender,</l>
<l>To save the threaten'd lives of the whole council,</l>
<l>Whom sleeping we secur'd.—Poorly content</l>
<l>To obey her mandate, though he knew it forc'd,</l>
<l>The dastard governor resign'd his charge,</l>
<l>And struck the Austrian banner.—Such the power</l>
<l>Of Juan's royal name, and conquering arm.</l>
<l>The rest himself will tell.—I must return.—</l>
<l><pb n="67" facs="74"/>Abroad the wild commotion rages still;</l>

<l>With kinder beams shall view this smiling land;</l>

From my lord?</l>

<l>Madam, not yet—A stranger at the gate,</l>
<l>Disguis'd, and almost breathless with his fears,</l>
<l>With earnest importunity entreats</l>
<l>He may have leave to cast him at your feet.</l>
<l>His accents mov'd me much; he seems afflicted.</l>

<speaker>VELASQUEZ.</speaker>
<l>Fate left no second choice.—Close at my heels</l>
<l>Revenge and death insatiably pursu'd;</l>
<l>Fear lent me speed, and this way wing'd my flight.</l>
<l>Why flash those eyes with anger?—Royal lady!</l>
<l>Fortune has stripp'd me of the power to injure;</l>
