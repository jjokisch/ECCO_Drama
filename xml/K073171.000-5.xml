<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>PRAY temper with patience your warm indignation,</l>
<l>And treat with more mercy my tender relation:</l>
<l>Because with your passions her whims interfere,</l>
<l>To her foibles, dear Carey, you're grossly severe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>My patience, sweet Frances, I own is exhausted:</l>
<l>She will wed the first suitor by whom she's accosted,</l>
<l><pb n="354" facs="363"/>Though in widowhood's dainty vagaries, her pride</l>
<l>Forbids her fair cousin to shine as a bride;</l>
<l>And keeps us, my Love, from that altar away,</l>
<l>Where Hymen with justice upbraids our delay.</l>
<l>But, in noble contempt of your unsettled dower,</l>
<l>Let us seize on the bliss that is plac'd in our power;</l>
<l>And, if such artful vanities yield her relief,</l>
<l>Leave my Lady to play off fresh fountains of grief,</l>
<l>While we, my sweet girl! pass our happier youth</l>
<l>In delights that are hallow'd by Nature and Truth:</l>
<l>Though my income is small, with your prudent direction,</l>
<l>Dear Fanny—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>I'm pleas'd with this proof of affection:</l>
<l>Yet before we our union, dear Carey, complete,</l>
<l>As your love is so ardent—let mine be discreet.</l>
<l>No honest return of regard should I feel,</l>
<l>Could I suffer your heart, in its generous zeal,</l>
<l>To abandon a portion your bride should obtain,</l>
<l>And hazard by hurry what patience will gain.</l>
<l>'Tis unlucky, my cousin, Sir Simon, forgot</l>
<l>To specify what be design'd as my lot:</l>
<l><pb n="355" facs="364"/>But I know this omission, by which I am left,</l>
<l>At her Ladyship's mercy, of fortune bereft,</l>
<l>Was the work of Old Vellum, whose foresight and skill</l>
<l>Were employ'd for himself, when he made the Knight's will.</l>
<l>Yet her Ladyship says, that my cousin told her</l>
<l>The sum that he meant upon me to confer;</l>
<l>And though she delays, from a delicate whim,</l>
<l>Lest our marriage should seem disrespectful to him—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>Good God! my dear Fanny, how can you defend her?</l>
<l>To refinement and faith she's an empty pretender.</l>
<l>Have not twelve months elaps'd from Sir Simon's interment?</l>
<l>Yet her sorrow still bubbles in ludicrous ferment;</l>
<l>Though the farce of her grief, as our friends have all said,</l>
<l>Is address'd to the living much more than the dead;</l>
<l>And her vanity means, though she prizes not pelf,</l>
<l>To keep you unmarried, and marry herself.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>Indeed you mistake all her harmless intentions;</l>
<l>She will certainly give me the fortune she mentions;</l>
<l><pb n="356" facs="365"/>I know her kind heart, and its pure inclination.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>Say rather, we know her absurd affectation:</l>
<l>And as for your portion, my dear, I as soon</l>
<l>Shall expect an estate to drop out of the moon,</l>
<l>As to see you receive from my Lady a shilling;</l>
<l>Allowing, indeed, that her heart may be willing,</l>
<l>She soon will have nothing, I fear, to bestow,</l>
<l>So profuse is she grown in her whimsical woe.</l>
<l>On the new Mausoleum what sums does she waste!</l>
<l>That fantastical fabric of barbarous taste;</l>
<l>Where all decorations that art can devise,</l>
<l>To adorn the proud tombs of the valiant and wise,</l>
<l>Are mix'd o'er the bones of a simple old cit,</l>
<l>Who display'd not a sparkle of valor or wit;</l>
<l>Who though rich, pass'd, I think, with small comfort through life,</l>
<l>A mere slave to the whims of his high-blooded wife.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>That preposterous vault I have view'd with concern!</l>
<l>And have cried and have laugh'd o'er Sir Simon's rich urn:</l>
<l><pb n="357" facs="366"/>But at length, having study'd her Ladyship's trim.</l>
<l>And loving her virtue in spite of her whim,</l>
<l>I've a scheme, that, I think, with success will be crown'd,</l>
<l>On this folly itself her correction to found;</l>
<l>By indulging her foible, that foible to banish.</l>
<l>And make all her mournful absurdity vanish.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>To your judgment, dear Fanny, I often submit,</l>
<l>And much could I hope from your goodness and wit;</l>
<l>Yet I think you can't make, in her youth's giddy season.</l>
<l>Such a vain wanton widow a creature of reason.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>You judges of nature, and lords of creation,</l>
<l>Howe'er you pretend to profound speculation,</l>
<l>Are exceedingly apt your, wise selves to deceive</l>
<l>In the judgments you pass on the daughters of Eve;</l>
<l>And most when you reckon, in every transaction,</l>
<l>One indelicate foible their sole spring of action.</l>
<l>My Lady Sophia you greatly mistake;</l>
<l>By nature she's neither a prude nor a rake:</l>
<l>At present, I own, she appears too demure;</l>
<l>But though her heart's tender, her bosom is pure:</l>
<l><pb n="358" facs="367"/>To a strong understanding she makes no pretence,</l>
<l>But has many mild virtues, and does not want sense:</l>
<l>One foible alone has o'erclouded her mind,</l>
<l>The foible of seeming supremely refin'd:</l>
<l>But if I succeed, this slight fault she will mend,</l>
<l>And you'll find her a worthy agreeable friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>You may say of her purity what you think fit,</l>
<l>But her case one specific alone will admit.</l>
<l>Believe me, whene'er a young widow's so prim,</l>
<l>And by quaint affectation so cramp'd in each limb,</l>
<l>A new husband alone, by his pliant embrace,</l>
<l>Can restore her starch'd form to its natural grace:</l>
<l>Is this, my fair Quack! the new nostrum you've got?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>Indeed you shan't hear any part of my plot,</l>
<l>Till I know its success.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>Ah! my dear, I'm afraid</l>
<l>This is some coy device my request to evade.</l>
<l>And to keep the wish'd day of our wedding still distant.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>No; in truth, by the aid of a secret assistant,</l>
<l><pb n="359" facs="368"/>I've a plan of great moment in high agitation,</l>
<l>Which may happily end all our various vexation:</l>
<l>Allow me three days for its perfect digestion,</l>
<l>And if in that time you will ask me no question,</l>
<l>I promise thenceforth, without murmur or strife,</l>
<l>To obey your commands for the rest of my life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>I gladly subscribe to this bargain of bliss;</l>
<l>So allow me to seal the kind bond with a kiss!</l>
<l>Remember, three days; I can't add a day more,</l>
<l>And shall fancy those three in duration threescore.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>O they'll pass very quick:—much amus'd you will be</l>
<l>With the three rival Bards whom to-day we shall see;</l>
<l>To whom my sad cousin oblig'd me to write</l>
<l>For sepulchral inscriptions in praise of her Knight:</l>
<l>They have sent each an epitaph hither before 'em,</l>
<l>And are coming themselves with all solemn decorum.</l>
<l>As each, without contest, expects here the laurel,</l>
<l>On her Ladyship's judgment they'll probably quarrel:</l>
<l>As you know the whole group, you must wait on the choir,</l>
<l>To soothe the irascible sons of the Lyre.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="360" facs="369"/>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>As to Facil and Trope, if they're hurt, I'll engage</l>
<l>That one glance of your eyes will extinguish their rage:</l>
<l>You will find them two chearful and good-humour'd lads;</l>
<l>And, whether their Pegasus gallops or pads,</l>
<l>It will please me, I own, if her Ladyship's fancies</l>
<l>May tend to recruit their declining finances:</l>
<l>But for splenetic Rumble, who, grandly absurd,</l>
<l>Never speaks without using a six-footed word,</l>
<l>I care not how much he is mortified here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>But the length of his words hits her Ladyship's ear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>His stiff phrases indeed may accord with her sorrow,</l>
<l>Yet his spleen Will insult her ere this time to-morrow;</l>
<l>For often he'll call, with quaint arrogant vanity,</l>
<l>Every head but his own the abode of inanity:</l>
<l>Because a great author's defects he has caught,</l>
<l>He vainly pretends to his vigor of thought;</l>
<l>Though, on similar grounds, he as well might suppose,</l>
<l>That, because some dark spots may be seen on his nose</l>
<l><pb n="361" facs="370"/>His face has the lustre and force of the fun.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>In our chorus of Bards I am glad he is one,</l>
<l>For I'm curious, I own, the strange elf to survey;</l>
<l>Though I'm rather afraid of his wife, who, they say,</l>
<l>Reads all the rough verses her husband has penn'd,</l>
<l>Till she stuns every ear she can tempt to attend.</l>
<l>She's to come with her Poet.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>I fancy they're here,</l>
<l>For I think I've the hum of his rhymes in my ear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>No, no; 'tis her Ladyship, mightily smitten</l>
<l>With the high-sounding epitaph Rumble has written.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>LADY SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>"This doleful domicile of dust contains</l>
<l>"Sir Simon Sentiment's inert remains;</l>
<l>"Though Death's cold stroke infrigidate his frame,</l>
<l>"Commerce resounds his emporetic name."</l>
<l><pb n="362" facs="371"/>Ah, my friends, here is verse truly grand and pathetic!</l>
<l>How exceedingly fine is the word emporetic!—</l>
<l>Why, Carey! you seem quite untouch'd by its beauty;</l>
<l>Of friendship, I fear, you forget the last duty:</l>
<l>You two giddy creatures, though both tender-hearted,</l>
<l>Think more of yourselves than of my dear departed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>As your Ladyship chuses to press me so hard,</l>
<l>I confess, though his memory still I regard,</l>
<l>That my thoughts from Sir Simon will frequently roam;</l>
<l>And I hope, when you've deck'd his funereal dome,</l>
<l>Your Ladyship's mind may, by Nature's direction,</l>
<l>Assume a more lively and chearful complexion;</l>
<l>That you'll mix once again—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>Never, Carey! no, never!</l>
<l>No time from his grave my devotion shall sever;</l>
<l>In my eye the fond tear of remembrance shall swim,</l>
<l>And each figh of my soul shall be sacred to him!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>Consider, dear Madam! that custom and reason</l>
<l>Prescribe to our sorrows a natural season;</l>
<l><pb n="363" facs="372"/>You have mourn'd like a model of conjugal truth,</l>
<l>Now attend to the claims of your beauty and youth;</l>
<l>In the bloom of your graces—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>Hold, hold, you wild thing!</l>
<l>In your fancy, I find, gross ideas will spring;</l>
<l>'Tis the fault of you men;—ere I chasten'd his mind,</l>
<l>My Sir Simon himself to that failing inclin'd:</l>
<l>But I taught him to change the loose laugh of futility,</l>
<l>For the sweet melting tear of refin'd sensibility,</l>
<l>Till through his mild frame such pure tenderness ran—</l>
<l>To such delicate softness I brought the dear man—</l>
<l>He would weep o'er the withering leaf of a rose,</l>
<l>And smile at the thorn though it wounded his nose.—</l>
<l>Ah, my gentle Sir Simon!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>Indeed, he was such,</l>
<l>That your thoughts cannot dwell on his image too much.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>Your soothing, kind sympathy charms me, my dear:</l>
<l>I now trust you will wait till the end of next year;</l>

<l>As you, my good girl! with such feeling attend,</l>
<l>When o'er the dear tomb of Sir Simon I bend,</l>

<l>To that most precious piece of inanimate clay,</l>
<l>That you may not omit o'er his ashes to sigh,</l>
<l>In considering what wedding-cloaths you must buy,</l>
<l>I've determin'd, my dear, as I think it your due,</l>
<l>To resign all my colour'd apparel to you;</l>
<l>To wear it again I indeed am unable,</l>

<l>I have told you, my dear, that, refin'd in my joy,</l>
<l>The array of affection I ne'er could destroy:</l>
<l>These are garments unsoil'd, that I beg you to take,</l>
<l>Thus preserv'd for the conquest they help'd me to make.</l>
<l>In the sweet days of courtship these garments I wore,</l>
<l>Vain memorials of pleasure that now is no more!</l>
<l>Of those dear days of triumph you'll now see the trophy,</l>
<l>When Sir Simon first call'd me angelical Sophy:—</l>

<l>Never fear it! I'll venture a wager</l>

<l>Where a small egg has dropt from his favorite hen,</l>
<l>He crows, and he flutters, and struts round the yard:</l>
<l>So engross'd by her joy is the wife of a Bard;</l>
<l>And by similar bustle attention she begs,</l>

<speaker>MR. RUMBLE.</speaker>
<l>Though we meet in the house of refin'd lamentation,</l>
<l>In your presence, I feel, Sir, some exhilaration;</l>
<l>Since I in this spot as a stranger appear,</l>
<l>I rejoice in a friend who domesticates here.</l>

<speaker>MRS. RUMBLE.</speaker>
<l>Sometimes, on the road,</l>
<l>My dear Mr. Rumble composes an ode;</l>
<l>For he says, in such motion his fancy shines most;</l>
<l>And all true lyric poets, you know, travel post:</l>
<l>But a chaise-boy, alas! is a sad ignoramus;</l>
<l>And the poor honest booby, whose blunder o'ercame us,</l>
<l>Mistook a Pindarical ejaculation</l>
<l>For a horrible, vulgar, profane execration,</l>
<l>And, turning to stare at my dear Mr. Rumble,</l>
<l>Drove against a steep hillock, which gave us a tumble.</l>

<l>This display of my trifles I cannot allow;</l>

<l>Ah, you dear, modest man! in a napkin you'd hide</l>
<l>The talent my love must contemplate with pride;</l>

<l>She shall see some sweet things that I pack'd up in haste,</l>

<l>Mrs. Rumble! the part of a wife is submission.—</l>

<l>No, indeed; do but hear me one stanza rehearse;</l>
<l>'Tis my favorite ode.</l>

<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>Mr. Rumble, you're blest in an excellent wife,</l>
<l>That superlative prize in the lott'ry of life;</l>
<l>The vow of the altar she rises above,</l>
<l>And adds admiration to duty and love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. RUMBLE.</speaker>
<l>My wife has, I think, the right feminine nerve:</l>
<l>Her sex was created to wonder and serve;</l>
<l>As their minds have from nature no ponderous powers,</l>
<l>They have nothing to do but to venerate ours.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>O fie! can you estimate woman so low?</l>
<l>To our fair female authors pray think what we owe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. RUMBLE.</speaker>
<l>I cannot read one, Sir, without oscitation:</l>
<l>They don't understand antithetic vibration;</l>
<l>Their ideas have nothing of height and profundity,</l>
<l>Their conceptions want vigor, their periods rotundity;</l>
<l>Their truth is too stale, or too feeble their fiction,</l>
<l>And I cannot endure their anomalous. diction:</l>
<l>But enough of these garrulous wasters of ink—</l>
<l>Her Ladyship likes my inscription, I think;</l>
<l><pb n="373" facs="382"/>That lugubrious poem no critic shall garble,</l>
<l>And, I trust, you can shew it me graven on marble.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>It would please me to give you that pleasure, dear Sir;</l>
<l>But, in truth, on this point there's a little demur.</l>
<l>Her Ladyship means to consult on the case.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. RUMBLE.</speaker>
<l>what, Sir! is my poem, expos'd to disgrace?</l>
<l>Her critical quacks does this woman engage,</l>
<l>To slash my sound verse with empirical rage?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, good Sir, all the homage that's due</l>
<l>To poetical genius she offers to you;</l>
<l>But her Ladyship's love for Sir Simon is such,</l>
<l>She thinks that he cannot be honour'd too much;</l>
<l>And, to give all his virtues their due celebration,</l>
<l>She from diverse poetical pens of our nation</l>
<l>Has a cargo of epitaphs.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. RUMBLE.</speaker>
<l>Hah! is it so!</l>
<l>Are there rivals to shoot in Apollo's strong bow?</l>
<l><pb n="374" facs="383"/>This should have been told me before;—but no matter:</l>
<l>My concurrents, perhaps, may more lavishly flatter,</l>
<l>Yet in funeral song they can't equal my tone;</l>
<l>Where Pope has miscarried, I triumph alone.—</l>
<l>Pray who are these Bards that with me are to cope?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>I think you're acquainted with Facil and Trope.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. RUMBLE.</speaker>
<l>What, Facil! whose verse is the thread of tenuity,</l>
<l>That fellow distinguish'd by flippant fatuity,</l>
<l>Who nonsense and rhyme can incessantly mingle,</l>
<l>A poet—if poetry's only a jingle.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>Poor Facil wants force; yet may frequently please</l>
<l>By a light airy mixture of mirth and of ease;</l>
<l>But Trope's lofty muse has a higher pretension.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. RUMBLE.</speaker>
<l>Sir! Trope is a rhymer devoid of invention,</l>
<l>Who talks in a high strutting style of the stars,</l>
<l>And the eagle of Jove, and the chariot of Mars;</l>
<l>And pompously tells, in elaborate lines,</l>
<l>That now the moon glistens, and now the sun shines.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="375" facs="384"/>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>How severe, my good friend, are you Bards to each other!</l>
<l>Yet if each would indulgently look on a brother,</l>
<l>For your general honor—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. RUMBLE.</speaker>
<l>I cannot agree</l>
<l>That these fellows have aught homogeneous with me;</l>
<l>To contend with such scribblers I deem a disgrace,</l>
<l>And my dignity bids me abandon, the place:</l>
<l>With her Ladyship's judgment I mean not to quarrel,</l>
<l>But shall leave her to crown any monkey with laurel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>Mr. Rumble! in points so exceedingly nice</l>
<l>I do not presume to obtrude my advice;</l>
<l>But allow me to mention, before you depart,</l>
<l>What may tend to encourage your liberal art.</l>
<l>Sir Simon, you know, had a passion for fame,</l>
<l>And left a large sum to eternize his name</l>
<l>By some structure of note; yet he never said what:</l>
<l>So a grand Mausoleum is rais'd on this spot,</l>
<l>At so vast an expence that my Lady, I find,</l>
<l>Has surpast what the Knight for the building design'd;</l>
<l><pb n="376" facs="385"/>The superfluous cost, be it great as it may,</l>
<l>From her own private purse she designs to defray;</l>
<l>Though an annual fund by the will is adjusted,</l>
<l>With the guidance of which she is also entrusted;</l>
<l>But from this, as I hear, she, has form'd an intention</l>
<l>To give the best epitaph-writer a pension.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. RUMBLE.</speaker>
<l>Has she so!—'tis a gracious, effulgent design;</l>
<l>I protest, of her judgment I highly opine.</l>
<l>Her face has been chiefly the subject of praise;</l>
<l>But a splendor of intellect now she displays.</l>
<l>I cannot abruptly depart from a scene</l>
<l>Whose mistress discovers the mind of a queen,</l>
<l>Nor rudely desert, though my time is precarious,</l>
<l>A lady whose graces are so multifarious:</l>
<l>But pray, lest some puppy should here circumvent me,</l>
<l>To her Ladyship can't you directly present me?</l>
<l>Though I fear, since my fall, I am hardly so clean as</l>
<l>A Bard should be seen by a female Maecenas.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>Never fear!—in your coat there is not so much dust</l>
<l>As to blind the bright eye that to merit is just.</l>
<l><pb n="377" facs="386"/>If you'll step in this room, which is call'd the Apollo,</l>
<l>And wait a few minutes, I'll speedily follow,</l>
<l>And acquaint you how soon we may hope for admission;—</l>
<l>My Lady loves form, in her present condition:</l>
<l>To amuse yourself there you'll, however, be able,</l>
<l>For you'll find all the epitaphs rang'd on the table.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. RUMBLE.</speaker>
<l>Are they so!—it is well!—I indeed love to slash</l>
<l>An inane poetaster's incongruous trash.
<stage>Exit.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>There I'll venture to leave the old cynical Rumble,</l>
<l>The prey he has seiz'd to growl over and mumble.</l>
<l>If this Bard, whom my Lady regards as her darling,</l>
<l>Has infus'd in his brothers his talent of snarling,</l>
<l>I think she will find little room to admire</l>
<l>The harmony form'd by her Lyrical Choir.—</l>
<l>But lo! the kind Muse an example now sends,</l>
<l>That two mortals at once may be poets and friends.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Facil <hi>and</hi> Trope.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>My dear lads of Parnastus! you're welcome together;</l>
<l>I am glad you associate, like birds of a feather.</l>
<l><pb n="378" facs="387"/>That fools may not cry, "Every Bard hates a brother,</l>
<l>"And Poets, like Pike, are the prey of each other."</l>
<l>How fare ye, my friends? have you prosper'd of late?</l>
<l>I hope each has rais'd his Parnassian estate!</l>
<l>In our last conversation I heard ye lament</l>
<l>That your farms on the mountain produc'd a low rent,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>In truth 'tis a niggardly soil, at the best,</l>
<l>As I and my brother can truly attest;</l>
<l>But with hopes of a new golden aera, my friend,</l>
<l>On your patroness here we are come to attend:</l>
<l>To encourage the arts she has spirit and sense,</l>
<l>And we're told, my dear Carey, her wealth is immense.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TROPE.</speaker>
<l>In fortune and soul she's a queen, 'tis agreed,</l>
<l>And of genius as fond as Christina the Swede;</l>
<l>For the Public's dull taste she, we trust, will console us,</l>
<l>And make our poor Helicon rich as Pactolus.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>Perhaps, my dear Carey, we owe to your care</l>
<l>The favor of this truly liberal Fair:</l>
<l><pb n="379" facs="388"/>You are, doubtless, appriz'd that my Lady requires—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>I know she has paid due respect to your lyres;</l>
<l>Yet, indeed, on that title no thanks can I claim;</l>
<l>You're indebted alone to your common friend, Fame:</l>
<l>Her Ladyship knows with what spirit you write,</l>
<l>And has begg'd your two Muses to honor her Knight;</l>
<l>And, I trust, to your mutual advantage and joy,</l>
<l>She'll reward the rare talents she wish'd to employ.</l>
<l>But be not too sanguine;—I know how you Bards</l>
<l>Build the fabric of Hope like a castle of cards:</l>
<l><hi>Entre nous,</hi> our good Lady is odd in her taste,</l>
<l>Tho' her mind is, no doubt, with munificence grac'd;</l>
<l>Perhaps to one Bard she'll be lavishly kind,</l>
<l>And appear to the other as utterly blind.</l>
<l>Then let each be prepar'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>So we are, my good friend,</l>
<l>And by mutual support shall each other defend:</l>
<l>To tell you a secret, we both wrote in haste,</l>
<l>And strangers alike to her Ladyship's taste;</l>
<l><pb n="380" facs="389"/>But agreed, as our purses are equally low,</l>
<l>To divide what on either she deigns to bestow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>The compact is friendly; I wish from my heart</l>
<l>That all who pursue the poetical art</l>
<l>Would learn, from you two, their mean rage to suppress,</l>
<l>And not rave at the sight of a rival's success.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>There, indeed, they may copy from Trope and from me:</l>
<l>From envy, thank Heaven! we are happily free;</l>
<l>We rally each other as much as we please;—</l>
<l>I laugh at his figures—he laughs at my ease;</l>
<l>Yet with rancour we ne'er try each other to hit,</l>
<l>But value Benevolence far above Wit.</l>
<l>The art we still doat on has ruin'd us both;</l>
<l>Yet to quit the deceiver we're equally loth:</l>
<l>From Commerce and Law we were led to retire</l>
<l>By the splendid illusions that wait on the Lyre;</l>
<l>And though cach has obtain'd a fair portion of praise.</l>
<l>We have no golden fruit in our chaplet of bays;</l>
<l>Still we look without spleen on our gains and our losses,</l>
<l>Each endear'd to the other by similar crosses.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="381" facs="390"/>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>In truth, my dear Bards, you're good-humour is rare;</l>
<l>You're philosophers both, and a singular pair:</l>
<l>With what excellent temper I've heard you rehearse</l>
<l>A malicious burlesque of your innocent verse!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>O, with me 'tis a rule not to quarrel with those</l>
<l>Who attack what I scribble in rhyme or in prose;</l>
<l>To skirmish with, you, how unjust should I be,</l>
<l>If, perchance, of my verses you don't think with me;</l>
<l>When, to tell you the truth, I'm so various an elf,</l>
<l>I have twenty opinions about them myself!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>what an honest confession!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>'Tis perfectly true;</l>
<l>Yet my works, I must own, I too rarely review;</l>
<l>And too quick in their birth are the brats of my brain:</l>
<l>My Muse is no parent inur'd to long pain,</l>
<l>Who dandles a rickety chit while it lives,</l>
<l>And loves it the more for the trouble it gives;</l>
<l><pb n="382" facs="391"/>She with lively dispatch, like a provident mother.</l>
<l>Soon as one child is born thinks of rearing another.—</l>
<l>But enough of a jade that is merely ideal;</l>
<l>Let us talk of a female, kind, lovely, and real;</l>
<l>An inspirer of something much sweeter than verse,</l>
<l>And, I hope, with a few thousand pounds in her purse:</l>
<l>I allude, my good friend, to Miss Jasper, your flame;</l>
<l>But, perhaps, she no longer is known by that name,</l>
<l>And has wisely exchang'd it for Carey.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>Not so;</l>
<l>The day of our wedding you'll certainly know,</l>
<l>As I hope that your Muse will the altar attend</l>
<l>With a rapturous ode on the bliss of your friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>I accept the gay office with infinite glee;—</l>
<l>But at present, I hope, the fair Nymph we shall see:</l>
<l>Trope and I were the intimate friends of her brother;</l>
<l>What a genius was he!—I ne'er knew such another:</l>
<l>At school we first saw him his talent display;</l>
<l>I remember he modell'd our figures in clay.</l>
<l><pb n="383" facs="392"/>The trade of a sculptor we thought not his fate.</l>
<l>But suppos'd he'd have half of Sir Simon's estate!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>So he would, had not Vellum's more provident care,</l>
<l>When he made the Knight's will, nam'd himself as his heir.</l>
<l>My Lady, indeed, has the rents for her life,</l>
<l>But to Vellum yields half if again she's a wife;</l>
<l>And if without issue her Ladyship dies,</l>
<l>All this ample estate is old Latitat's prize.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>And what says poor Jasper, that spirited lad?</l>
<l>Faith, I think such a will might have driven him mad!</l>
<l>Though engag'd by his art, he, I'm sure, must be nettled;</l>
<l>But in Russia, they say, he is happily settled.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>When a generous mind has embrac'd a fine art,</l>
<l>With Fortune's vain gifts it can readily part;</l>
<l>From the world's dirty cares it detaches itself,</l>
<l>To contend for a prize far superior to pelf;</l>
<l>And looks with contempt (I am sure that you feel it)</l>
<l>Upon heart-hard'ning gold, and the villains who steal it.</l>
<l><pb n="384" facs="393"/>Such a mind, from his childhood, your friend has possest;</l>
<l>And in Russia, I hear, he is busy and blest;</l>
<l>For a patroness there, of imperial spirit,</l>
<l>The munificent Catherine, honors his merit.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>I protest, in the different realms of the earth,</l>
<l>There is no friend, like woman, to genius and worth!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TROPE.</speaker>
<l>I wish you and I may a Catherine find</l>
<l>In the widow whose Knight in our verse is enshrin'd!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>You perhaps, my dear Carey, can tell us some news:</l>
<l>Has her Ladyship told you her thoughts of our Muse?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>One thing, my good friends, I can tell you at present,</l>
<l>But I fear you'll not think it exceedingly pleasant;</l>
<l>Yet it's certainly fit you should instantly know it,</l>
<l>And, indeed, emulation inspirits a poet:</l>
<l>Nay, look not so grave!—'tis a rival—that's all,</l>
<l>A candidate come at her Ladyship's call.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>A rival! who is it?</l>

<l>On this I have founded my whimsical plan,</l>
<l>In hopes of producing this fortunate man:</l>
<l><pb n="389" facs="398"/>My brother, I know, has a passion for her;</l>
<l>And she soon to all men would his person prefer.</l>
<l>But in my rapid project he will not be steady,</l>
<l>Unless I persuade him she loves him already;</l>
<l>For men rarely know, though of knowledge they're vain,</l>
<l>By a well-manag'd minute how much they may gain.</l>
<l>And should he detect the kind art I employ,</l>
<l>Farewell to my hopes of their conjugal joy!—</l>
<l>I yesterday thought that my plan could not fail;</l>
<l>Now I think 'twill be marvellous should it prevail.—</l>
<l>But away, cruel fears! hence, ye painful alarms!</l>
<l>I behold my dear brother restor'd to my arms!</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Jasper.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Heaven bless thee, dear girl!—you have got me once more,</l>
<l>In spite of my vow not to visit this shore;</l>
<l>And I joyfully fly, with affection's quick pace,</l>
<l>To enfold thy kind heart in a brother's embrace:</l>
<l>With that in my grasp, I true opulence feel,</l>
<l>And my wealth in this casket no lawyer can steal.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="390" facs="399"/>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>If love and esteem may be reckon'd as treasure,</l>
<l>You indeed, my dear brother, are rich above measure!</l>
<l>O how have I long'd all your feelings to learn!</l>
<l>How ardently pray'd for your speedy return!</l>
<l>How often accus'd your indignant delay!</l>
<l>What a million of things had I ready to say!</l>
<l>What questions to ask!—and yet now you are come,</l>
<l>The confusion of joy has almost made me dumb!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>My tender, good girl!—I perceive you retain</l>
<l>All your lively sensations of pleasure and pain.—</l>
<l>But these tears will relieve you—don't check them, my dear;</l>
<l>'Tis a tribute my heart is inclin'd to revere;</l>
<l>All flattering language I prize them above,</l>
<l>And hold them the truest expression of love:</l>
<l>And indeed, when I think what distress and regret</l>
<l>Have harrass'd your sensible mind since we met;</l>
<l>When I think how, from sordid self-interest free,</l>
<l>You forget your own wrongs in attention to me;</l>
<l>I feel tears of gratitude ready to start,</l>
<l>And confess my dear sister the pride of my heart!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="391" facs="400"/>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Yet, for life, you could talk of deserting this sister!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>But you see, when she pleaded I could not resist her.—</l>
<l>When I first was inform'd of old Vellum's vile fraud,</l>
<l>In my rage I determin'd on living abroad:</l>
<l>For Russia, you know, I departed from Rome;</l>
<l>However, my dear, you may safely presume</l>
<l>Such an absence from you I could never endure,</l>
<l>Had you not brought me back by a different lure;</l>
<l>And my friends of the Law with your wishes conspir'd,</l>
<l>To make me return with the haste you desir'd,</l>
<l>As they give me some hopes of soon changing our fate,</l>
<l>And regaining from Vellum the pilfer'd estate.—</l>
<l>But how fares my dear widow? whose partial affection</l>
<l>Seems kindled by some friendly angel's direction,</l>
<l>To redress half our wrongs, and defeat the old thief,</l>
<l>Who impos'd on Sir Simon's too simple belief.</l>
<l>A rascal! to feign a regard for my fame,</l>
<l>And steal my estate, not to injure my name.</l>
<l>I thought not my cousin so easy a fool;</l>
<l>How the deuce could old Vellum so make him his tool!</l>
<l><pb n="392" facs="401"/>For the Knight, on this plea, sign'd his will when in health,</l>
<l>Not to spoil a great artist by giving me wealth.—</l>
<l>But where's my kind widow?—I long to express—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>You must pardon a little demureness in dress,</l>
<l>Nor expect her, though you to all men she prefers,</l>
<l>To fly into your arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>No; let me fly to her's.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Not so fast, my dear brother; you surely forget</l>
<l>By what vigilant enemies we are beset!</l>
<l>Should Vellum, whose spies are now under this roof,</l>
<l>And against whose vile art no affection is proof,</l>
<l>Should he get the least hint of my Lady's attachment,</l>
<l>He would rage like the wolf in that new-painted hatchment;</l>
<l>Your mutual regard he would set at defiance,</l>
<l>And move earth and hell to prevent your alliance.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Would he so?—By my faith, as the widow's so kind,</l>
<l>I care not what mischiefs may lurk in his mind;</l>
<l><pb n="393" facs="402"/>Not a legion of imps, by a lawyer instructed,</l>
<l>Shall mar the sweet business her heart has conducted.—</l>
<l>But has she quite hid her connubial design?</l>
<l>Has the rogue no surmise she will shortly be mine?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>No, not any.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Well manag'd, my dear fairy elf!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>To say truth, 'tis a secret not known to herself.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>To herself!—am I dup'd then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Dear brother, be cool.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Have you sent for me home, but to make me a fool?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>No indeed! but to make you most happy for life,</l>
<l>And give you a lovely and excellent wife;</l>
<l>In so serious a point could you think that I jested?—</l>
<l>Have you purchas'd the licence my letter requested?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="394" facs="403"/>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Here it is—and our folly will finely expose,</l>
<l>If the fair one escapes whom this chain should inclose.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Implicitly trust to my care as your guide,</l>
<l>And ere midnight, perhaps, you may clasp a kind bride.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>You teaze me, dear girl! with much whimsical pain;</l>
<l>But I beg that you'll clearly these riddles explain.</l>
<l>I fear you have form'd some nonsensical plot:</l>
<l>Has the Widow declar'd she will have me, or not?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Dear brother! indulge me with patient attention,</l>
<l>And our true situation I'll honestly mention:</l>
<l>But, however my project may strike you at first,</l>
<l>Into rage and despair do not hastily burst;</l>
<l>To be bold in such points is, in truth, to be wise,</l>
<l>And a widow's a fort to be won by surprize.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>So she has not engag'd, then, to give me her hand?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Have patience!—her state you shall soon understand.</l>
<l><pb n="395" facs="404"/>That she loves you, I know; and with innocent art</l>
<l>I have cherish'd the passion still hid in her heart:</l>
<l>For she fancies, good creature! that, safe from love's flashes,</l>
<l>She's devoted for life to Sir Simon's cold ashes.—</l>
<l>You know, she affects to be highly refin'd:</l>
<l>And a project I've built on this cast of her mind,</l>
<l>Which, if you'll obey me, I'll venture my life,</l>
<l>Like a stroke of true magic, will make her your wife,</l>
<l>And before any soul can suspect our intention.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Well, my girl! and pray what is your magic invention?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>You must know, she believes that you only return</l>
<l>To oblige her, by gracing Sir Simon's rich urn:</l>
<l>She thinks the Czarina, on this one condition,</l>
<l>That you travel incog. gives you her kind permission;</l>
<l>And her Ladyship's mind I have fill'd with these notions,</l>
<l>As they form an excuse for concealing your motions:</l>
<l>So she hopes from your hand, with the highest delight,</l>
<l>To behold a fine statue of her noble Knight.</l>
<l><pb n="396" facs="405"/>Now, Sir Simon and you have been thought much alike;</l>
<l>And, to make the resemblance more forcibly strike,</l>
<l>I mean to array you, her heart to entrap,</l>
<l>In his blue sattin night-gown and red velvet cap;</l>
<l>The dress which, to humour his elegant Fair,</l>
<l>The courteous old Cit was contented to wear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>And is this your fine plan! you impertinent jade?</l>
<l>Dress me up as the Punch of a dull masquerade!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Have patience!—my scheme must surprize you, no doubt,</l>
<l>Yet I think you'll applaud, if you hear it throughout;</l>
<l>And if you have spirit I know 'twill succeed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Well, you've made me an idiot; so tell me the whole.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>No! I've taught you to make yourself all you desire,</l>
<l>If you will but restrain this intemperate fire.—</l>
<l><pb n="397" facs="406"/>Come, attend to my plot:—You fond creatures shall meet</l>
<l>In the new Mausoleum, that pensive retreat;</l>
<l>On a pedestal there you your person must place,</l>
<l>To shew how a statue the building may grace:</l>
<l>To behold you so fixt I'll my Lady prepare:</l>
<l>She'll be struck in surveying your figure and air;</l>
<l>She with tender surprize will your features review,</l>
<l>And fancy she sees her Sir Simon in you:</l>
<l>Then spring from your pedestal, seize her sweet charms,</l>
<l>And swear, as you fold her soft heart in your arms,</l>
<l>You are like her Sir Simon in soul as in form,</l>
<l>That your heart towards her is as tenderly warm;</l>
<l>You may add—in a vision he bade you direct her</l>
<l>To take you for life as her legal protector,</l>
<l>And, to make her chaste love to his memory known,</l>
<l>Chuse his living resemblance before one of stone.—</l>
<l>There's a promising scheme for a widow's relief!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Set woman to woman, as thief to catch thief!—</l>
<l>I confess in your plot there is spirit and soul;</l>
<l>On her governing foible you've grounded the whole;</l>
<l><pb n="398" facs="407"/>And rapid success might attend on your plan,</l>
<l>But for puppet-shew courtship I am not the man:</l>
<l>I possess not the face that your stratagem needs,</l>
<l>For so bold an attack on a widow in weeds;</l>
<l>And I feel some reluctance, in truth, at my heart,</l>
<l>To such an appearance of fraudulent art.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Away, my dear brother, with scruples like these!</l>
<l>Of the amorous heart doubt's a common disease,</l>
<l>But one that my counsels may speedily cure:</l>
<l>You both love each other—your meaning is pure—</l>
<l>The gentle Sophia you'll tenderly treat,</l>
<l>Her form is enchanting, her temper is sweet;</l>
<l>And if your odd courtship appears like a jest,</l>
<l>In your marriage, I'm sure, you'll be equally blest:</l>
<l>Without it, indeed, our fair friend is undone,</l>
<l>For old Vellum intends that the coxcomb his son,</l>
<l>When he comes from his travels—But somebody's near;</l>
<l>A sudden surprize in this quarter I fear,</l>

<l>In chaste admiration and tender respect:</l>
<l>No licentious design with my passion could mingle;</l>

<l>But what is it, dear Facil, pray tell me the whole?</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>What figure?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>Why, Rumble: I now see him stand</l>
<l>With his garments half-button'd, a scroll in his hand;</l>
<l>And the poor frighted girl!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TROPE.</speaker>
<l>What the deuce do you mean?</l>
<l>In an odd wanton frolic has Rumble been seen—</l>
<l><pb n="415" facs="424"/>To an Abigail's room did the old Bard repair?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>No, no, I'll relate to you all the affair.—</l>
<l>You must know that our punch had so heated my brain,</l>
<l>That to sleep half the night I endeavour'd in vain;</l>
<l>But was just in a slumber, between three and four,</l>
<l>When a half-array'd figure threw open my door:</l>
<l>'Twas a poor trembling damsel, who hastily said,</l>
<l>"Rise! rise! or you'll surely be burnt in your bed!"</l>
<l>And I heard Rumble's voice thrice repeat the word "Fire!"</l>
<l>But as that dreadful word was soon follow'd by "Lyre,"</l>
<l>I perceiv'd the good girl, I now held by the arm,</l>
<l>Had mistaken his verse for a cry of alarm.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TROPE.</speaker>
<l>Very good!—he has often these starts in the night.</l>
<l>But how did you calm the poor girl in her fright?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>The wild little wench, like a poor frighted hare,</l>
<l>Knew not which way to run, and did nothing but stare;</l>
<l>When, holding the door of my chamber a-jar,</l>
<l>We perceiv'd, by the aid of the bright morning-star,</l>
<l><pb n="416" facs="425"/>The old Bard, who of liquor had taken his fill,</l>
<l>Sally forth from his quarters in odd dishabille;</l>
<l>With punch and with poetry heated, he swaggers,</l>
<l>And reels down the stairs, like a horse in the staggers,</l>
<l>Repeating with emphasis, several times,</l>
<l>The unfortunate word in his dangerous rhymes;</l>
<l>And the girl, who now saw her mistake very clear,</l>
<l>Laugh'd, in spite of her shame, at the source of her fear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TROPE.</speaker>
<l>And you, I suppose, when her terror was fled,</l>
<l>Taught her bloom to revive by the warmth of your bed?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>No, indeed; had her panic been only affected,</l>
<l>I perhaps had been foolish, as you have suspected;</l>
<l>But her fear and her modesty both were so true</l>
<l>That they won my regard, and she safely withdrew.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TROPE.</speaker>
<l>But where's our friend Rumble?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>O, nobody knows.</l>

<speaker>TROPE.</speaker>
<l>To some shady retreat he is gone to compose.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="417" facs="426"/>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>On the house-top, perhaps, like a bird he may sit;</l>
<l>He considers keen air as a friend to his wit.</l>
<l>It would not surprize me this phoenix to see</l>
<l>Oddly perch'd on a bough of an old lofty tree;</l>
<l>For he thinks he writes best when he's nearest to heaven:</l>
<l>But he'll soon want his breakfast—'tis much after seven.</l>

<l>Hark! what is that noise, like the woodman's loud stroke?</l>

<l>The ridiculous whim of too feeling a heart.</l>
<l>Sir Simon had many calm virtues, whose claim</l>
<l>From ungrateful Oblivion shall rescue his name:</l>
<l>But all the distinctions of rank are confus'd,</l>
<l>Fame herself is insulted, and Art is abus'd,</l>
<l>When the plume and the laurel insultingly wave</l>
<l>O'er the honest plain Merchant's preposterous grave:</l>
<l>Convinc'd of this truth, 'tis my Lady's design</l>
<l>To alter this dome on a new plan of mine.</l>
<l><pb n="428" facs="437"/>Here with Freedom and Ease you, my friends, may reside;</l>
<l>Good apartments for each I shall quickly provide:</l>
<l>For this dome, where the Founder shall rise in a nich,</l>
<l>Is to prove an asylum for artists not rich.</l>

<l>I am charm'd with your project, dear Jasper!</l>
</sp>

<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>Yet hear:—</l>
<l>By the will there's a fund of four hundred a year</l>
<l>Of real hard cash, from incumbrances free,</l>
<l>Which my Lady herself is to guide as trustee,</l>
<l>To support any structure she chuses to plan,</l>
<l>To perpetuate the name of her worthy good man;</l>
<l>This between you, dear Bards, she is pleas'd to adjust:</l>
<l>And when opulent Honesty sinks in the dust,</l>
<l>May his heirs ever use what he leaves upon earth</l>
<l>In securing calm comfort to Genius and Worth!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FACIL.</speaker>
<l>We always have said, and your actions evince,</l>
<l>You, Jasper, were born with the soul of a prince;</l>
<l>But our gratitude how shall we utter to you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JASPER.</speaker>
<l>By returning your thanks where they chiefly are due.</l>
<l><pb n="429" facs="438"/>My Lady's pure bounty, that scorns to be stinted,</l>
<l>Surpast in your favour whatever I hinted.—</l>
<l>To prove that I wed not from motives of pelf,</l>
<l>I have settled her wealth on her generous self;</l>
<l>She is rich, and intends to make use of her treasure</l>
<l>In the purchase of noble and permanent pleasure:</l>
<l>At the highest of interest our gold we employ,</l>
<l>When it brings a return of benevolent joy.—</l>
<l>Thank my stars! all my wishes are crown'd with success;</l>
<l>Kind Fortune, I just now have learn'd by express,</l>
<l>Outruns, in our favor, the slow step of Law:</l>
<l>Old Vellum, alarm'd by our hints of a flaw</l>
<l>In the base legal work that Fraud led him to frame,</l>
<l>The reversion he stole has propos'd to disclaim,</l>
<l>Upon terms which I now, for tranquillity's sake,</l>
<l>At my Lady's request, shall be willing to take.—</l>
<l>But come, my good friends, let us haste to the hall,</l>
<l>Where the Bride will be happy to welcome you all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAREY.</speaker>
<l>Well, my friend! I confess, in the course of my life,</l>
<l>I have oft been provok'd with your new lovely wife;</l>
<l><pb n="430" facs="439"/>But for this her last act her late whims I forgive,</l>
<l>And shall bless the kind creature as long as I live.—</l>
<l>You will teach, as you mold her to life's sweetest duty,</l>
<l>All her virtues to shine as complete as her beauty:</l>
<l>And may each childless widow, in youth's lively state,</l>
<l>Who has yielded an honest old husband to fate,</l>
<l>In a partner like you find the surest relief,</l>
<l>And to sensible joy turn fantastical grief!</l>
