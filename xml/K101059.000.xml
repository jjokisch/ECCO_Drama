<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>FRUITFUL in good and ill, the teaming earth</l>
<l>To wheat and tares affords promiscuous birth:</l>
<l>At once, from nature's womb, rise woe and weal;</l>
<l>The springs that poison, and the streams that heal.</l>
<l>Nay more, her offspring each and all contain,</l>
<l>Within themselves, both antidote and bane.</l>
<l>Each is a jarring world, where death yields life;</l>
<l>And concord rises out of endless strife.</l>
<l>Each seems distinct, yet all together bound:</l>
<l>And separate and collectively is found</l>
<l>A hoard of infinite; a countless mass</l>
<l>Of miracles within a blade of grass.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>First of the tribe, and master of the whole,</l>
<l>Man stands erect; the sovereign and the soul.</l>
<l>In him all union and disunion shine:</l>
<l>He's now above half brute; now more than half divine.</l>
<l>Wayward in humour; infinite in wit;</l>
<l>The slave of all, to none will he submit;</l>
<l>In act an idiot; in conceit a sage;</l>
<l>Mov'd by a breath, he'll brave the tempest's rage;</l>
<l>Now soar, a demi-god; now sink, a straw;</l>
<l>Now weep, a child; now give the planets law.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Railing at wretchedness, in folly wise,</l>
<l>Alive to all the bliss that he denies,</l>
<l>Worthy your laughter or perhaps your tears,</l>
<l>Brain-sick of errors past, to night appears</l>
<l>A moody mortal; sketch'd on this mad plan;</l>
<l>A surly misanthrope, and yet a man.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Within his orbit other beings move;</l>
<l>Some urg'd by av'rice, others spurr'd by love,</l>
<l>To aid or injure him, as passion drives;</l>
<l>The worst of servants; and the best of wives:</l>
<l>With many more, all waiting here within;</l>
<l>My task being ended, ready to begin.</l>
<l>Hear, and decide, like men who think and feel:</l>
<l>For, from this night's decree, there's no appeal.</l>

<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>What is it you are pleased to be talking, pray, about my lady, Mr. Scotch Donald?</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Don.</speaker>
<p>Troth, Mrs. English Sarsnet, nae ward o' ill.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>Ill truly! No, sir, my lady may defy her worst enemies! Though there are folks, who ought to adore the very ground she treads upon, that use her like a Turk!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>How now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>

<p>My lady sent me here, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>And did she bid you behave with impertinence?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>She, indeed! A dear suffering saint! She bid me always behave with affability and decorum: and so I would, if I could But it would provoke an angel!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>And what is it your wisdom thinks so provoking!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>To see a sweet lady sit for hours, and pine and grieve; and then, when some folks are in sight, pretend to smile and be all <hi>assignation</hi> and contentment, when all the while her poor heart is ready to break!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Then she complains to you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>I said no such thing, sir! No: she complains to no christian foul; more's the shame! I wish some folks had a little of my spirit! other folks, mayhap, <hi>mut</hi> find the difference!</p>

<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>A poor weak woman, who can only take her own part by crying, and fainting!</p>

<p>Ye forget, Mrs. Sarsnet, there are some poor weak women that ha' tongues and nails.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>Have they, Mr. Snap-short? Why then, if I had you for a husband, mayhap I would let you see that I could use them.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Don.</speaker>
<p>The muckle de'el may doubt yee!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>It's a shame, Mr. Donald, for you to be getting into corners, and whispering and peering and plotting to my lady's dishonour!</p>

<p>Yes, yes; we know that very well, Mr. Donald.</p>

<p>Did your lady, I say, instruct you to behave with this insolence?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>You know very well, sir, my lady is the best of wives! she sent me on a civil message, and bid me speak with <hi>properiety:</hi> and so, if speaking one's mind and telling the truth be a fault, its all my own.</p>

<p>Oh, to be sure; you may tell my lady and get me turned away, if you please! because, I know very well, if you bid her, she will do it!</p>

<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Prometheus and his vulture is no fable!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>But, as it is all for love of my lady, I am sure the Earl of Olderest, her father, will give me a <hi>sitiation</hi> He knows, mayhap, more than you may think. So does the Viscount her brother, too; her aunt lady Mary, and her uncle the Bishop: and every body is not obliged to be so blind and so tame as my lady!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>What is it they know?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>That's more than I can say; but they have all been here, and my lady desires to speak with you.</p>

<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
<p>Indeed!—I have no leisure.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>I <hi>prognostified</hi> the answer!—A good for nothing chap!—I know very well what is becoming of a husband! He should love his wife, dearly, by day and by night! he should wait upon her; and give her her own way; and keep her from the cold, and the wet; and provide her with every thing comfortable; and if the happen to be in an ill humour, should coax her, and bear a little snubbing patiently!

<sp>
<speaker>Item. </speaker>
<stage>(Eagerly.)</stage>
<p>My dear Grime, I am glad you are come! Well, is the deed prepared?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>Ready for sealing. Mr. Mordent never examines what he signs! he trusts all to you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>We cannot be too safe. But, this other affair? this Joanna? What have you done? Have you decoyed her to Mrs. Enfield's?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>Really, Mr. Item, she is so fine a creature that, when I consigned her over, I am not a true Christian if I did not feel such a twinge here!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Curse your twinges? Is she safe? Did she suspect nothing?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>No, no! The poor innocent blessed herself, to think what a kind protectress Providence had sent her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item. </speaker>
<stage>(Joy.)</stage>
<p>That is well! That is well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>But I do not yet understand why you should seek the ruin of this lovely creature?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>I? You mistake: 'tis Mr. Mordent!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>What, wish destruction to his child?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>No, no. We neither of us seek her harm; but our own safety.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>Which way?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>He has various tormentors; his wife, or rather her proud relations, are among the chief; and he dreads they should come to the knowledge of this secret. But his strongest terror is of being detected, in having for years disowned a child who, if now produced, would be his everlasting disgrace.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>Then he does not know that his daughter is now in the house of Mrs. Enfield?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Not a word. His plan, for the present, is to settle her in some profession: for this he will bestow a thousand pounds, which, ha, ha, ha! I am to expend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime. </speaker>
<stage>(significantly.)</stage>
<p>Or keep?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item. </speaker>
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
<p>Plague! I have said too much.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime. </speaker>
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
<p>Oh, oh! A thousand pounds?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>That—that, my dear Grime, would be a paltry motive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime. </speaker>
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
<p>I'll have my share!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Mordent has been all his life squandering, like a blockhead, what I have been prudently picking up.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>And pretty pickings you have had, Mr. Item!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item. </speaker>
<stage>(Exulting.)</stage>
<p>I have him in the toils! Interest accumulating, upon interest, and all in arrear. I can foreclose upon him when I please, for all except the Berkshire estate; and by this second mortgage, agreeably to the deed you have brought, equity of redemption
<pb n="11" facs="10"/>will be forfeited, and that as well as the rest will then be mine!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>If he had but signed and sealed—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Which he shall do this very day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>Still, why are you the enemy of Joanna? What have you to sear from her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Much! Very much! An action of recovery!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>How so? She has no title! She is illegitimate!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Would she were! No, no; a lawful daughter, born in wedlock; her mother poor but virtuous, and died in childbed. Fearful it should injure his second marriage with lady Anne, he never produced the infant, but told his man, Donald, it was a natural daughter, and by his intermission secretly maintained and had her educated.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>Why not employ the same agent still?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Because this Donald has got the fool's disease, pity, and threatens to make Mordent own his daughter, or impeach.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>And it was prudent to place her beyond Donald's knowledge?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>It was.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>Ha! 'Tis a strange world! Well, now, Mr. Item, give me leave to say a word or two on my own affairs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>To be sure my dear friend! Speak and spare not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>There is the thousand pounds, you mentioned.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item. </speaker>
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>

<p>Then the premium on this mortgage—In short, Mr. Item, I do all your business, stand in your shoes;—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>You are my right hand, the apple of my eyes!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Ay, but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>The dearest friend I have on earth!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>The division of profits—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Don't mention it. Am not I your friend? I shall not live for ever.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>What is life? A continual cloud; pregnant with mischief, malignity, disease and death. Happiness? An ignis fatuus. Pleasure? A nonentity. Existence? A misfortune, a burthen. None but fools condescend to live. Men exert their whole faculties to torture one another. Animals are the prey of animals. Flowers bloom to be plucked and perish. The very grass grows to be torn and eaten: trees to be mangled, sawed, rooted up, and burned. The whole is a system of exquisite misery, and I have my full proportion!—Oh! this girl! Why am I thus perturbed concerning her; She can but be wretched; and wretchedness is the certain sate of all! But then, the world? Why what an insatuated ass am I; contemning
<pb n="13" facs="12"/>the world and all it contains, yet living in continual dread of its reproof!</p>
<stage>[<hi>Re-enter.</hi> ITEM.]</stage>
<p>Well, my good Mr. Item, this poor Joanna! What have you done? Can you secure her happiness? Pshaw! Fool! Can you lighten her misery? I can think of nothing but her; though distraction is in every thought?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a serious affair: very serious—you ought to do nothing lightly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Turned adrift, rejected of all, no relation, no friend, never acknowledged, never?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>My advice you know, Sir, was at once boldly to produce her, as your daughter. No matter for the impertinent clamours and questions of who her mother was, and what became of her; why the child was never owned; where she had been concealed, and for what purposes?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, ay! The malignant sneers of friends, the cutting calumny of enemies, the reproaches of Lady Anne, the insults of her pompous proud family!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>For my part, I obey your commands, but I cannot approve them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>My late ward, Mr. Cheveril, should he hear of it what would he think?—Then this Berkshire mortgage!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Ay, there again! Totally opposite to my advice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Can you shew me any other possible way of paying my debts?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>The danger of signing it is extreme!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>'Tis ruin! But what matter? Is not the whole one mass of wretchedness?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Young Cheveril, I own, has demands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Then the out-standing bills—tradesmen are provokingly insolent!</p>

<p>Ay, ay! They, like the rest, have their appointed office of torture!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Well, remember I have given you fair warning!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Certainly! You do your part, and with the
<pb n="14" facs="13"/>best intentions; goad, and sting, and add your quantum to the sum of suffering! The consistency of evil is amazing! good and bad, all concur!—Is the deed ready?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I must first read it through.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Do so. I leave it all to you.</p>

<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>I told your Ladyship he would refuse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>What reason did he give?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>Reason, forsooth! Husbands never have any reason!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A. </speaker>
<stage>(To herself.)</stage>
<p>Unkind man! Why does he thus wish to avoid me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>He keeps his distance, both day and night! But I would teach him to sleep in two beds! A pretty fashon truly! I would tell him I was afraid of ghosts; and so I married because I could not nor I would not lie alone. So let him remember that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Why were you so long in bringing the message back?.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>Why that is what I have to tell your Ladyship. If there <hi>is</hi> not bad doings, say I am no witch.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>Your Ladyship must not be angry; but you know I can't help having a sharp eye and a quick ear of my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>What have you been doing now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>So I saw my Master go into the steward's room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A. </speaker>
<stage>(Endeavouring to suppress her curiosity.)</stage>
<p>Pshaw! Folly! What of that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>So I had all my seven senses and my eye-teeth about me.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Pray have done!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>So I clapped my ear to the keyhole; and then I heard a—whuz, buz—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>This was very improper!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>So I could only catch up a word here and there; and the first was <hi>summut</hi> about—of a child!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>A child?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>And a mother, my Lady! Though for the matter of that, where there is a child, one's own <hi>nataral penetrality</hi> will tell one there must be a mother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Of what weakness am I guilty?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>And I thought I catched the sound of Mr. Item of a fathering the child! and I'm <hi>posituve</hi> he said it <hi>wuz</hi> against his conscience!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Who said so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Item, my Lady! And so a little bit after, my master called somebody a poor <hi>injurious</hi> girl, and a <hi>prodigality</hi> of wit and beauty! So then I heard somebody's foot on the stairs, and I <hi>wuz</hi> fain to scamper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>I know not why I listen to this indecent prattle! My over-anxious curiosity betrays me, and you are much too forward to profit by my weakness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>Because you know, my Lady, I love you in my heart; and it is all for your own good.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>A child! An injured girl! Yet why do I feel agitation? His infidelities have been too open, for me to be ignorant of them. And who has been to blame; he or I? Oh! doubtful and difficult question!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>But I'll come at the truth, I'll warrant me, in all its <hi>particlers!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Suffering perhaps under the consciousness of error, which the sight of me might increase, he flies from additional anguish. Oh! that I had the power to sooth and reconcile him to himself! Why will he not receive consolation from me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>I'll rummage about.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>If I am unhappy, how must I be certain that it is not my own fault? Where there is unhappiness, neither party can be wholly blameless.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>He ought to love and adore such a Lady! and clothe her in satin and gold!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Shall I tyrannize over the affections that I cannot win? If I want the power to please, let me correct my own defects, and not accuse my husband of insensibility! Oh, nothing is so killing to a husband's love, as a discontented, irksome, wailing wife! let me be any thing but that!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>He is a barbarian Turk! and so I as good as told him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>What is the test of an affectionate wife? It is that, being wronged, her love remains undiminished; having cause of complaint, she scorns to complain, convinced that any misery is more welcome than the possibility of becoming the torment of her bosom's Lord! Oh, let me rather suffer every possible evil than endure my husband's hate!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>If any fellow was to use me so, I know what I would do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Yet have I not lost his love? Dreadful doubt! My family advise a separation, and, if this fatal loss be real, how is it to be avoided? Yet, I will not sightly yield! Let me hope my efforts will not all be ineffectual. Would this agonizing contest were ended!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Sar.</speaker>
<p>She may say what she will, but I know very well she is the most <hi>miserable-est</hi> lady alive, and I could tear his eyes out! Husband, indeed? And so, because I listened to the fellow's love, and nonsensestuff, and took pity on him, when he was going to hang or drown himself, he must think, as soon as he has got me safe, to be my lord and master! I'd tell him another story! My lord and master, truly!</p>

<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Clement you are wrong: You cherish the fond hope of alleviating misery. Ah!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I—My situation is a painful one, but every feeling of honesty and duty compel me to inform you that, when once you have signed this deed, you will be wholly in the grasp of mercenary men, who will pay no respect to former profits, the benefits they have received, or the feelings and distresses of him by whom they have acquired wealth, power, and pride.</p>

<speaker>Mrs. En.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chev.</speaker>
<p>Your acquaintance, honest Mr. Grime, informed me you have a sample of a fine sort.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. En.</speaker>
<p>Ah, you are too late!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chev.</speaker>
<p>My friend Lennox has paid you one hundred pounds. Don't stare; I know the whole. Bring me to the lady, and, if I like her—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. En.</speaker>
<p>I am very sorry, sir, but I cannot: my honour won't let me.</p>

<speaker>Chev.</speaker>
<p>Prodigious virtue! Come, come! Lennox is cunning forty; I am foolish one and twenty. He is too old to be a lavish paymaster,</p>

<p>Ah, sir, that is your mistake! He is too young! He will pay better as he grows older.</p>

<p>Permission? Oh, yes—No! I'll be wicked but not unprincipled: I won't lie! That is a paltry scoundrel vice; no soul in it. Look you, if that sum will not content you, tell me what will?</p>

<p>Why you grumbling old blockhead, what would you have? May you not thank me for every shilling you are worth in the world?</p>

<p>Don't tell me Mr. Item! I am but your scavenger, and you put me to a deal of dirty work.</p>

<p>Well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Item.</speaker>
<p>Did I not take you to Monmouth-Street, make you cast your beggar's skin, transform you into something almost human, hire you apartments in the Temple, and pass you on my master for a rich usurer, a damned rogue?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Grime.</speaker>
<p>Very true. But you would not let me act my part! You took care to be the damned rogue yourself!</p>

<p>Before?</p>

<p>Mr. Mordent, I am driven upon an agonizing task, which a too painful sense of duty only could oblige me to execute.</p>

<p>Proceed, Madam; apologies, for feeling or for inflicting pain, are quite unnecessary!</p>

<p>And what is his authority?</p>
</sp>

<p>I know not. But I, it seems, have innocently been the cause that she is disowned and abandoned. Of such an act I cannot knowingly consent to be a moment guilty. The fatal period is come! that separation which I so much have dreaded, is inevitable!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>And you support your fate with patience.</p>

<p>I know! I know!—I am the vilest of men!</p>

<p>Madam I—I—I request I may be tortured by any thing but your candor.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Oh, exquisite! Continue! my nerves are strung!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>To despair of recovering those inestimable blessings was quite sufficient! But to be the cause of banishing a child from a father's arms and heart? to cast it an orphan on a tempestuous world? No! whatever

<p>And now, I have one last request to make; which I conjure you, by all our former affection not to deny!</p>

<p>To ask favours, where there is neither the power to grant nor the desire to be thanked, is fruitless,</p>

<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>I am but too well acquainted with the state of your affairs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>A humane motive for parting!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>The settlements you have made on me, in our early days of love, were ample. In the sincerity of affection, I vowed, if ever they should be necessary to your happiness, that moment they should again be yours.</p>

<speaker>Mor. </speaker>
<stage>(Greatly agitated.)</stage>
<p>Madam?</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor. </speaker>
<stage>(Indignantly.)</stage>
<p>Never!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Stop! Beware of rashness! You are a father, and have a father's sacred duties to fulfil. Take home your daughter: make her what amends you can for the desertion of a parent's love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>'Tis too much! Scorpions could not sting like this!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>On this last occasion, suffer a gleam of former kindness once more to warm your bosom. Money is a poor vehicle, for the affections of the soul! a contemptible token of the love I have borne you! but, such as it is, for that love's sake, give it welcome! A cold adieu I cannot take! It freezes my very heart! From my soul, I ever have loved, and ever shall love! Had I a heaven of happiness to bestow, would you but deign to accept it from me, it should be yours.</p>

<p>WE are now in private.</p>

<sp>

<p>I am glad we are.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>And now, Sir, I insist on a clear and explicit answer. Where have you lodged Joanna?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Len.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir, Where have you lodged Joanna?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Lennox, I will not be trifled with! where is she?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Len.</speaker>
<p>Nor will I be trifled with, Mr. Mordent: I say where is she? The contrivance was your own! I know you! The moment you set your eyes on her you began your cursed plots, to secure her for yourself; and, when you found I would not give her up at your persuasion, you put them in practice while you treacherously pretended to scure her to me.—I tell you, I know you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>This will not serve, sir, it is all evasion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="65" facs="64"/>
<speaker>Len.</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir, it is evasion! cunning, base, damned evasion! and I affirm she is in your possession.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Lennox, I am at this moment a determined and desperate man, and must be answered—Where is she?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Len.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I am as determined and as desperate as yourself, and I say, where is she? For you alone can tell?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>'Tis false!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Len.</speaker>
<p>False?</p>

<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Ay, false!</p>

<p>He is the falsest of the false that dares whisper such a word!</p>

<p>Hark you, sir, I understand your meaning, and came purposely provided. <stage>(Draws a pair of pistols.)</stage> Take your choice. They are loaded.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Len.</speaker>
<p>Oh, with all my heart! <stage>(Presents at some paces distant.)</stage> Come, sir.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mor. </speaker>

<speaker>Len.</speaker>
<p>Why do you turn it out of the line?— <stage>(Drops his arm. Pause,)</stage> I see your intention, Mordent! You are tired of life, and want me to murder you!—Damn it, man, that is not treating your friend like a friend!—Kill me if you will, but don't make me your assassin!</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Pause—both greatly affected.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor. </speaker>
<stage>(Tenderly.)</stage>
<p>Nay, kill me, or tell me where you have lodged the wretched girl.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Len. </speaker>
<stage>(With great energy.)</stage>
<p>Fiends seize me if I have lodged her any where, or know what is become of her.</p>
</sp>

<p>Your behaviour tells me you are sincere, and to convince you at once that I am no less so, know—she is my daughter!</p>

<p>I'll seek it through with you to find her.—Forgive me?</p>

<p>Would I could forgive myself!</p>

<stage>(With animation.)</stage>
<p>But it seems then she has escaped, and is perhaps in safety.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Oh that she were!—Donald used to meet her here, in the Green Park, about this time of the evening. <stage>(Listens,)</stage> I hear the sound of feet. <stage>(Looks.)</stage> 'Tis not a woman. Let us retire among the trees, and keep on the watch.</p>

<speaker>Joanna.</speaker>
<p>Whither shall I run?—Where shall I hide? How fly the pursuits of wicked men, and women still more depraved?

<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Yes, dear girl, your rare endowments surpass my hopes; and, convinced as I am that beauty is destructive, and wisdom impotent, I joy to find you thus adorned.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Joanna.</speaker>
<p>Wait to know me better. I fear you should prize me above my worth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>How shall I reward it? Fool that I am, madman that I have been.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Joanna. </speaker>
<stage>(Rapturously kissing his hand.)</stage>
<p>This is my rich reward!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>I have told you in part my desperate situation. If Grime would but give honest evidence—But of that there is little hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Joanna.</speaker>
<p>My greatest fear arises from what you have said of Lady Anne. I must not, will not be the cause of separation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Let me do her justice: She is a miracle of forbearance. I have hated and spurned at the kindness I did not deserve. Her perseverance in good has been my astonishment and my torture.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Joanna.</speaker>
<p>Oh that I could see you reconciled! Oh that I could gain the love of such a lady!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Of that, sweet girl, you are certain. Lennox is with her, and by this she knows your story; and I am sure adores your virtue.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Oh! noble girl! <stage>(Runs and embraces Joanna.)</stage> Forgive this rude tumult of affection, which I cannot restrain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Joanna.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Mordent, you are now a million fold more dear to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>I cannot bear it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Will you be my daughter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Joanna.</speaker>
<p>Oh, madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Will you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Joanna.</speaker>
<p>Adversity I could endure, but this unhoped-for tide of blessings overpowers me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Oh, how I hate myself!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>And why?—Can you be ignorant of the virtuous struggles which have caused the conflict you have felt? The strength of these sensations shew how fitted you are to be great and good.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>To be a—I dare not think!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Indeed you are wrong. Had I not been guilty of a thousand errors, you never would have had occasion for this self reproach. Like cowards, we both have shunned inquiry. Let us be more courageous; let us affectionately communicate our mutual mistakes, and while we examine we shall correct the mind, expand the heart, and render ourselves dear to each other, and beneficent to the whole world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Oh shame, shame!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady A.</speaker>
<p>Nay, my love—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Joanna.</speaker>

<p>Well, well, I will endure existence a little longer, if it be but to hate myself.</p>

<p>Come, come, guardian, dismiss these <hi>sombre</hi> familiars, they have plagued you long enough. Clement is in eager search of you, to communicate secrets of the utmost importance concerning his uncle.</p>

<stage>Mrs. POPE, Miss WALLIS, <hi>and</hi> Mrs. MATTOCKS <hi>come forward.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mrs.</hi> POPE.</speaker>
<l>AND now, thrice gentle friends, our plotting ended,</l>
<l>We hope you're pleas'd—at least not much offended?</l>
<l>Surely, you'll own it was a little moving,</l>
<l>To see a modern wife so very loving!</l>
<l>Who deems the marriage vow a thing expedient!</l>
<l>And is at once meek! faithful! and obedient!</l>
<l>Such whims were common in the golden age:</l>
<l>And still they may be met with—on the stage:</l>
<l>But grant they now are false, past contradiction,</l>
<l>We hope they yet may be endur'd—in fiction.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> WALLIS.</speaker>
<l>You've heard that good Queen Bess had maids of honour;</l>
<l>Whose courtly trade it was to wait upon her;</l>
<l>To quaff brown stout, yet not be overtaken,</l>
<l>Breakfast on beef, and sup on eggs and bacon?</l>
<l>In those strange days, I can't say what might happen!</l>
<l>Virtue might, then, be thought the woman's weapon!</l>
<l>But daughters now like me, whate'er we feign,</l>
<l>No where exist; but in a poet's brain!</l>
<l>Such blunders are too gross! No soul can brook 'em!</l>
<l>And yet I wish, for once, you'd overlook 'em.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mrs.</hi> MATTOCKS.</speaker>
<l>Poor Man! He's mad! An heir of one and twenty,</l>
<l>With frolicks, freaks, and pounds and passions plenty,</l>
<l>Who, being told where he may purchase beauty,</l>
<l>Begins to cant of conscience, love, and duty?</l>
<l>Was such stuff ever heard? Ye sprigs of fashion,</l>
<l>Say, is it thus you treat the tender passion?</l>
<l>'Ere such shall come, and prophets shall speak truth!</l>
<l>Yet, put him not in poet's purgatory;</l>
<l>For, should you damn him, we shall all be sorry.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> WALLIS.</speaker>
<p>Then be sweet temper'd!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mrs.</hi> MATTOCKS.</speaker>
<p>Grant the man his cause!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mrs.</hi> POPE.</speaker>
<p>And once more make us blest in your applause.</p>
