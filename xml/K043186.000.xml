<byline>BY T. VAUGHAN, ESQ.</byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. BARRYMORE.</byline>
<sp>
<l>THE title giv'n to our play</l>
<l>Is whimsical and odd, you'll say,</l>
<l>Because announc'd—The Wedding Day.</l>
<l>But know you not, my friends above,</l>
<stage>To the Galleries.</stage>
<l>'Tis what you one and all approve?</l>
<l>For when you squeeze each other's hand,</l>
<l>And find your wishes at a stand,</l>
<l>You press the Wedding Day, and cry,</l>
<l>Come, let's to church, my dear, and try</l>
<l>Who loves the truest—you or I.</l>
<l>Then as 'tis known a day of bliss,</l>
<l>Pray let it not prove <hi>here</hi> amiss;</l>
<l>For tho' elop'd—I know not how—</l>
<l>From <hi>Next door Neighbours</hi>—just below—</l>
<l>And hither come to make her bow—</l>
<l>Like other trips of gallant love,</l>
<l>Constant <hi>to both</hi> you'll find her prove.</l>
<l>Or who is right, or who is wrong,</l>
<l>With me to state does not belong;</l>
<l>But only to proclaim the banns,</l>
<l>And leave to you th' applauding hands;</l>
<l>Nor hope to find one critic here</l>
<l>Will dare forbid our Wedding Cheer;</l>
<l>But give their usual friendly boon,</l>
<l>And let's enjoy <hi>the honey-moon.</hi></l>
<l>To laugh is all our author means</l>
<l>In what she pourtrays in her scenes,</l>
<l>And aims, in all she dares to write,</l>
<l>To make her Wedding Day—a merry night.</l>

<head><hi>SCENE I.</hi><stage>An Apartment at Lord <hi>RAKELAND's.</hi></stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter a</hi> SERVANT, <hi>followed by Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>AT home? To be sure I am—how could you make any doubts about it?
<stage>[<hi>Exit</hi> Servant.]</stage>
Deny me to my old acquaintance, and favourite friend, Tom Contest!</p>
<stage><hi>Enter Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</stage>
<p>My dear Contest, I congratulate us both that your travels are completed, and that you are come to taste, for the remainder of your life, the joys of your own country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Whether to taste joy or sorrow I am yet in doubt; for I am uncertain in what manner I shall be received by my father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>Have not you seen him yet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>No:—nor dare I till I know in what humour he is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>In a good one, you may depend upon it; for he is very lately married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>To my utter concern! I heard some time ago indeed, that it was his design to marry again; but as he has never condescended to make me acquainted with it himself, I know nothing farther respecting the marriage than what public report has thrown in my way. Pray can you tell me who my new mother is?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>I am told she is very young, extremely lively, and prodigiously beautiful. I am told too that she has been confined in the country, dressed, and treated like a child, till her present age of eighteen, in order to preserve the appearance of youth in her mother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>But who is her mother? Of what family is she?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>That I don't know—and I suppose your father did not consider of what family she was, but merely what family she was likely to bring him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I have no doubt but he married on purpose
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
to disinherit me, for having written to him, "that I had fixed my affections upon a widow of small fortune, but one who was so perfectly to my wishes, that even his commands could not force me to forsake her."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>And were you in earnest?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>I thought I was then: but at present I am more humble. I have implored his pardon for those hasty expressions, and now only presume by supplication to obtain his approbation of my choice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>Is she a foreigner?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>No; an English woman.—We met at Florence—parted at Venice—and she arrived in London just four days before me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>And when will you introduce me to her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Are you as much a man of gallantry as ever? If you are, you shall first promise me not to make love to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>As to that, my dear friend, you know I never make a promise when I think there is the least probability of my breaking it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Then positively you shall not see my choice
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
till I am secure of her. But I can tell you what I'll do—I'll introduce you to my young mother-in-law, if you like.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>My dear friend, that will do quite as well—nay, I don't know if it won't do better. Come, let us go directly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Hold! not till I have obtained my father's leave:—for, after offending him so highly as not to hear from him these six months, I thought it necessary to send a letter to him as soon as I arrived this morning, to beg his permission to wait upon him. And here, I suppose, is his answer.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter a</hi> SERVANT, <hi>and gives a letter to Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<p>Your servant enquired for you, Sir, and left this.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage>[<hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST <hi>breaks open the letter hastily, and reads.</hi>]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>An invitation to go to his house immediately.
<stage>He reads the remainder of the letter, and then expressing surprise</stage>
—Why my father tells me he was only married this very morning! I heard he was married a week ago!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>And so did I—and so did half the town. His marriage has even been in the newspapers these three days.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Ay, these things are always announced before they take place: and I most sincerely wish it had been delayed still longer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>I do not—for I long to have a kiss of the bride.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! my Lord: as it is the wedding day, I cannot think of taking you now: it may be improper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>Not at all, not at all. A wedding day is a public day; and Sir Adam knows upon what familiar terms you and I are. Indeed, my dear friend, my going will be considered but as neighbourly. I can take no denial—I must go.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Well, if it must be so, come then.
<stage>Going, stops.</stage>
Notwithstanding the cause I have for rejoicing at this kind invitation from my father, still I feel embarrassed at the thoughts of appearing before him, in the presence of his young wife; for I have no doubt but she'll take a dislike to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>And if she should, I have no doubt but she'll take a liking to <hi>me.</hi> So come away, and be in spirits.
<stage>Exeunt.</stage></p>

<head>SCENE II. <stage><hi>An Apartment at Sir</hi> ADAM CONTEST's.</stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter Sir</hi> ADAM, <hi>drest in white clothes like a Bridegroom.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>Nothing is so provoking as to be in a situation where one is expected to be merry—it is like being asked in company "to tell a good story, and to be entertaining;" and then you are sure to be duller than ever you were in your life. Now, notwithstanding this is my wedding day, I am in such a blessed humour that I should like to make every person's life in this house a burthen to them. But I won't
<stage>Struggling with himself</stage>
—No, I won't.—What a continual combat is mine! To feel a perpetual tendency to every vice, and to possess no one laudable quality, but that of a determination to overcome all my temptations. I am strongly impelled to violent anger, and yet I have the resolution to be a calm, peaceable man—I am inclined to suspicion, yet I conquer it, and <hi>will</hi> place confidence in others—I am disposed to malice, yet I constantly get the better of it—I am addicted to love, yet I—No, hold!—there I must stop—that is a failing which always did get the better of <hi>me.</hi> Behold an instance of it.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Lady</hi> CONTEST <hi>slowly and pensively, drest like a Bride.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p><stage>Aside.</stage>
Now I will be in a good humour, in spite of all my doubts and fears.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Did you send for me, Sir Adam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my dear; your guardian is just stept home, to bring his wife to dine with us; and I wished to have a few minutes conversation with you. Sit down.
<stage>They sit.</stage>
I observed, Lady Contest (and it gave me uneasiness), that at church this morning, while the ceremony was performing, you looked very pale. You have not yet wholly regained your colour: and instead of your usual cheerful countenance and air, I perceive a pensive, dejected—Come, look cheerful.
<stage>Very sharply</stage>
—Why don't you look cheerful?
<stage>Checking himself, and softening his voice</stage>
—Consider, every one should be happy upon their wedding day, for it is a day that seldom comes above once in a person's life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>But with <hi>you,</hi> Sir Adam, it has come twice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>Very true—it has—and my <hi>first</hi> was a day indeed! I shall never forget it! My wife was as young as you are now—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>And you were younger than you are now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p><stage>Starts—then aside</stage>
—No, I won't be angry.
<stage>To her</stage>
—She was beautiful too—nay more, she was good; she possessed every quality.—But this is not a proper topic on the present occasion; and so, my dear, let us change the subject.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="11"/>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir Adam, is it true that your son is come to town?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>It is; and I expect him here every moment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>And have you invited no other company all day?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>Your guardian and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Ploughman, you know, will be here; and what other company would you have?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>In the country we had always fiddles and dancing at every wedding; and I declare I have been merrier at other people's weddings, than I think I am likely to be at my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>If you loved me, Lady Contest, you would be merry in my company alone. <hi>Do</hi> you love me? My first wife loved me dearly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>And so do I love you dearly—just the same as I would love my father, if he were alive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p><stage>Aside.</stage>
Now could I lay her at my feet for that sentence. But I won't—I won't.
<stage>Struggling with himself</stage>
Answer me this—would you change husbands with any one of your acquaintance?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>What signifies now my answering such a question as that, when I am sure not one of my acquaintance would change with me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>What makes you think so?
<stage>Violently</stage>
—
<stage>Softening</stage>
—Your equipage will be by far the most splendid of any lady's you will visit. I have made good my promise in respect to your jewels too; and I hope you like them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Like them! to be sure!—Oh my dear Sir Adam, they even make me like you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>A very poor proof of your love, if you can give me no other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>But I'll give you fifty others.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p><stage>Anxiously.</stage>
Name them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>First—I will always be obedient to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>That's well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Second—I will never be angry with you if you should go out and stay for a month—nay, for a year—or for as long as ever you like.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p><stage>Aside, and struggling with his passion.</stage>
Sure I
<pb n="10" facs="13"/>
was not born to commit murder? I had better go out of the room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<stage>Humming a tune.</stage>
<p>"And old Robin Gray was kind to me."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<stage>Rising in agitation.</stage>
<p>Oh my first wife, my first wife, what a treasure was she! But my treasure is gone!</p>
<stage>Sighing.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Not all your money, I hope, Sir Adam; for my guardian told me you had a great deal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>And did you marry me for that? What makes you blush? Come, confess to me—for there was always a sincerity in your nature which charmed me beyond your beauty. It was that sincerity, and that alone, which captivated me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Then I am surprised you did not marry your chaplain's widow, good old Mrs. Brown!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>Why so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Because I have heard you say "there was not so <hi>sincere</hi> a woman on the face of the earth."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<stage>Aside.</stage>
<p>And egad I almost wish I had married her. By what I have now said, Lady Contest, I meant to let you know, that in comparison
<pb n="11" facs="14"/>
with virtues, I have no esteem for a youthful or a beautiful face.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear! how you and I differ! for I here declare, I do love a beautiful youthful face, better than I love any thing in the whole world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<stage>In a half-smothered rage.</stage>
<p>Leave the room—leave the room instantly.
<stage>After a violent struggle.</stage>
No: Come back—come back, my dear—
<stage>Tenderly</stage>
—
<stage>Aside.</stage>
I'll be in a good humour presently—but not just yet.—Yes—I <hi>will</hi> get the better of it.—I won't use her ill—I have sworn at the altar, not to use her ill, and I will keep my vow.
<stage>He sits down affecting perfect composure, and after a pause</stage>
—Pray, Lady Contest, pray, have not you heard from your mother yet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Not a line, nor a word.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>It is wonderful that she should not send us a proper address! There is no doubt but that every letter we have sent to her since she has been abroad, has miscarried. However, it will be great joy and pride to her, when she hears of your marriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Yes—for she always said I was not born to make my fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>Which prediction I have annulled. And after all—Come hither—come hither—
<stage><hi>Takes her kindly
<pb n="12" facs="15"/>
by the hand</hi></stage>
—And after all, I do not repent that I have—for although I cannot say that you possess all those qualifications which my first wife did, yet you behave very well considering your age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>And I am sure so do you, considering yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>All my resolution is gone, and I can keep my temper no longer.
<stage>Aside</stage>
Go into your own chamber immediately.
<stage>He takes her by the hand and puts her off.</stage>
I'll—I'll—I'll—
<stage>Threatening as if going to follow her, then stops short.</stage>
No, I'll go another way.

</sp>

<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>You have behaved very ill; but as you appear sensible of it, I forgive, and am glad to see you. But I expect that your future conduct shall give proof of your repentance.

<p>Dear Sir Adam,
<stage>[half laughing]</stage>
I was never so surprised in my life! Always when you spoke of your son you called him Tom, and Tommy, and I expected to see a little boy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>And have you any objection to his being a man?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Oh no, I think I like him the better.
<stage><hi>To Mr.</hi> Contest</stage>
—Sir, I am very glad to see you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>I give your Ladyship joy.
<stage>Salutes her hand.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>I shall be very fond of him, Sir Adam—I shall like him as well as if he was my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="17"/>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p><stage>Aside.</stage>
Now am I in a rage, lest seeing my son a man, she should be more powerfully reminded that I am old; and I long to turn him out of doors. But I won't—no—I'll be the kinder to him for this very suspicion. Come, Tom, let me shake hands with you—we have not shaken hands a great while; and let this be a sign of the full renewal of my paternal affection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>Sir Adam, you have not introduced me to Lady Contest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Is this another son?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>What, could you be fond of him too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I could.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM-</speaker>
<p>And like him as well as if he were your own?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I could.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>But he is not my son.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>I can't help thinking he is.
<stage>Looking stedfastly at him.</stage></p>

<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>I tell you he is not.</p>
</sp>

<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, you are joking—I am sure he is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p><stage>Raising his voice.</stage>
I tell you, no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Why he is very like you.
<stage><hi>She goes up to Lord</hi> Rakeland, <hi>and looks in his face.</hi></stage>
No, he is not so like when you are close. I beg ten thousand pardons, Sir, you are not at all like Sir Adam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p><stage>Aside.</stage>
Zounds, now I am jealous—and I am afraid my propensity will get the better of me. But no, it shan't—No, it <hi>shall not.</hi>—My Lord, I beg your pardon, but I want half an hour's private conversation with my son; will you excuse us?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, Sir Adam—I beg you will make no stranger of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p><stage><hi>Taking Mr.</hi> Contest <hi>by the hand.</hi></stage>
Come, Tom.
<stage>Aside</stage>
—There, now, I have left them alone; and I think this is triumphing over my jealousy pretty well. Well done, Sir Adam, well done, well done.
<stage><hi>Exit with Mr.</hi> Contest, <hi>Sir</hi> Adam <hi>smiling with self-applause at the victory he has gained.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>My dear Lady Contest, though I acknowledge I have not the happiness to be your son, yet, permit me to beg a blessing on my knees—'Tis this—Tell me when and where I shall have the happiness of seeing you again?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="19"/>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Dear Sir, without any compliment, the happiness will be done to me.</p>

<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>Enchanting woman! appoint the time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>No—without his being present.</p>

<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>I don't know if I sha'n't like that full as well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>Appoint a time, then; just to play a game at cribbage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Or what do you think of "Beggar my Neighbour?"—would not that do as well?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>Perfectly as well. The very thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>But you must take care how you play; for it is a game you may lose a great deal of money by.</p>
</sp>

<stage>Affecting good humour.</stage>
What, my Lord, here still? holding conversation with this giddy woman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p><stage>Affecting coldness.</stage>
I assure you, Sir Adam, I am very well pleased with Lady Contest's conversation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>And I am sure, my Lord, I am very <hi>much</hi> pleased with yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>We have been talking about a game at cards.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>But you said Sir Adam was not to be of the party.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir Adam—but not Mr. Contest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>No, indeed you said Sir Adam.</p>

<p>Oh no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p><stage>Eagerly.</stage>
Yes—because, don't you remember I said—and you made answer—</p>

<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>I don't remember any thing—</p>
</sp>

<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>How! What!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lord</hi> RAKELAND.</speaker>
<p>Sir Adam, it would be a breach of good manners were I to contradict Lady Contest a second time; therefore I acknowledge that she is right—and that I have been in the wrong.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit, bowing with great respect.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>

Won't you ask him to dinner?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>Ask him to dinner! What a difference between you and my first wife!—Would <hi>she</hi> have wished me to ask him to dinner? would <hi>she</hi> have suffered a man to kneel—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>I did not suffer him to kneel a moment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>—But my first wife was a model of perfection, and it is unjust to reproach you with the comparison. Yet I cannot help saying—would she had lived!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>And I am sure I wish so, with all my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p><stage>Fetching a heavy sigh.</stage>
But she was suddenly snatched from me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>How was it, Sir Adam? Were you not at sea
<pb n="19" facs="22"/>
together? And so a storm arose—and so you took to the long-boat—and she would stay in the ship—and so she called to you, and you would not go—and you called to her, and she would not come. And so your boat sailed, and her ship sunk.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>Don't, don't—I can't bear to hear it repeated. I loved her too sincerely. But the only proof I can now give of my affection, is to be kind to her son; and as by what he acknowledged to me, his heart I perceived was bent upon marriage, I have given him leave to introduce to me the lady on whom he has fixed his choice—and if I like her—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Has he fixed his choice? Who is the young lady? What is her name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>I did not ask her name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>But I hope you will give your consent, whoever she is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>And if I do, in a little time they may both wish I had not. Young people are so capricious they don't know their own minds half an hour. For instance, I dare say you think very highly of that young Lord who was here just now; but if you were to see him two or three times a week, you would cease to admire him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>I should like to try. Do invite him here two or three times a week, on purpose to try.</p>

<p>Here, John!

Go and look for your mistress's wedding ring; she has dropt it somewhere about the house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>I am afraid it was in the street, as I stepp'd out of my coach. Oh! indeed, Sir Adam, it did not stick close. I remember I pulled my glove off just at that time; go and look there, John.
<stage>[<hi>Exit</hi> SERVANT.]</stage>
Oh! Sir Adam, some ill luck will certainly happen to one or both of us: you may depend upon it.</p>

<p>Childish nonsense! What ill luck can happen to us while we are good?</p>

<stage><hi>Enter Lady</hi> AUTUMN <hi>and Mrs.</hi> HAMFORD.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mrs.</hi> HAMFORD.</speaker>
<p>MY dear Lady Autumn, Mr. Contest is not of a proper age for a lover, much less for a husband of yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> AUTUMN.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Hamford, I believe, old as you pretend to think me now, you thought me young but a few weeks ago at Venice; when, on your first landing there, you imposed upon me your romantic tale, and prevailed with me to bring you to England.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mrs.</hi> HAMFORD.</speaker>
<p>Hold, Madam, do not conclude too hastily, that, because I have for a few days since my arrival in my native country, deferred my promise of revealing to you my real name and my connections here, that I am for this reason an impostor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> AUTUMN.</speaker>
<p>No; upon recollection, you certainly <hi>have</hi> been living on a savage island for these ten or twelve years, which gives you all these Hottentot ideas in respect to the advanced age of women. In some savage countries women are old at seventeen; but in this enlightened nation we are all young at seventy.</p>

<stage><pb n="23" facs="26"/><hi>Enter Mr.</hi> MILLDEN.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> MILLDEN.</speaker>
<p>Lady Autumn, I make no apology for entering your apartment thus abruptly, because I come with good news—Your daughter is married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> AUTUMN.</speaker>
<p>Married! What! while I have been abroad?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> MILLDEN.</speaker>
<p>No doubt—But I cannot give you any particulars of the marriage, nor tell you even the gentleman's name—for I only passed her guardian by accident in his carriage, and I had not an opportunity to enquire, nor he to inform me farther, than "that it was a most advantageous union for your daughter, for that her husband is a man of fortune and title."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mrs.</hi> HAMFORD.</speaker>
<p>There, Lady Autumn! you find you have a daughter old enough to be a wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> AUTUMN.</speaker>
<p>More shame for her—Why was not my consent asked?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> MILLDEN.</speaker>
<p>You were out of England, and no letters reached you. However, your daughter's guardian will call upon you in the evening, and explain to you every particular.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> AUTUMN.</speaker>
<p>But now, my dear Mr. Millden, and you my dear Mrs. Hamford, don't let this marriage escape your lips, if Mr. Contest should call this

evening—for if my daughter's husband should not, after all, be a man of some importance, I should wish to keep it a secret from Mr. Contest that I have a daughter married.

<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> MILLDEN.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Hamford, I observe a gloom upon your countenance; I hope no enquiries you have made concerning any part of your family since you arrived in England—

—You tremble! What's the matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mrs.</hi> HAMFORD.</speaker>
<p>I tremble till a visit which I am now going to make is over; and then, whatever is my destiny, I trust in that Power which has supported me through numerous trials, to give me resignation.</p>

<p>Your mother is arrived in town: your guardian heard so this morning, but he did not mention it to me till this moment, because he thinks it is proper for him to wait upon, and acquaint her with our marriage in form, before I throw myself at her feet, to ask her blessing.</p>

<speaker><hi>Mrs.</hi> HAMFORD.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, Sir Adam and Lady Autumn, these mutual reproaches, for almost the self-same fault, ought to convince you, that in your plans of wedlock you have both been wrong.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>However, it shall be <hi>my</hi> endeavour to be henceforward right: for after settling upon my young bride a handsome dower, I will peaceably yield her up;—and though it is a hard struggle, yet, like all my other struggles, it will, I have no doubt, give me happiness in the end.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p><stage>Crying till she sobs.</stage>
Good b'ye, Sir Adam—good b'ye—I did love you a little upon my word; and if I was not sure you were going to be so much happier with your first wife, I should never know a moment's peace.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>I thank you. And at parting, all I have to request of you is—that you will not marry again till I die.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir Adam, I will not—but then you won't make it long?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> ADAM.</speaker>
<p>I believe I shan't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> CONTEST.</speaker>
<p>And my next husband shall be of my own age; but he shall possess, Sir Adam, your principles of honour. And then, if my wedding ring should unhappily sit loose, I will guard it with unwearied discretion: and I will hold it <hi>sacred</hi>—even though it should <hi>pinch</hi> my finger.</p>
