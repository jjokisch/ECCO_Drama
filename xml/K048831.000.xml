<p>ALBINA had the honour of being known to your Lordship, almost from her infancy. Her faults, and her graces, You are already acquainted with, as she grew up in some measure beneath your Lordship's eye. She is now arrived at maturity; and if in her present state, my Lord, you should find her more polished, than when she had last the honour of your attention, it is chiefly owing to the hints with which you then favoured me.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>THE very favourable reception with which the Pieces I have presented to the Stage, have been honoured by the Public, has given them the appearance of great success; and it is probable that those who were witnesses of their reception, will be surprised to find this Tragedy prefaced by complaints of hardship and injury, and to know that it has been productive of a train of mortifications and disappointments to its Author.</p>
<p>It is with the utmost reluctance that I feel myself compelled to enter into the disagreeable circumstances which preceded the representation. This is however necessary, as I now present a Tragedy, which I presume to call <hi>original,</hi> to the cooler inspection of the Reader, though I know that the principal circumstances of the plot, and the leading traits of character, have appeared in other Plays, previous to the representation of this.</p>
<p>The idea of writing for the Stage struck me by mere accident, and the <hi>Runaway</hi> was my first literary attempt of any kind. I am as ready, as the severest Critic can wish, to admit that it has all the crudeness of a first attempt. It succeeded however, on the Stage, far beyond my most sanguine expectations; and during its run, which was stopped by the Benefits, was one of the most profitable Plays, both to the Author and Manager, that appears on the records of the <hi>Treasury-books</hi> at either House.—A success so encouraging opened a new prospect of advantage to my Family, which I have since pursued with alacrity; but this success closed with the unfortunate period in which Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> resigned the management of Drury-Lane.</p>
<p>When Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> obtained a share of the Patent, I flattered myself that I had some right to his attention, as Author of the last piece which was produced by his able Predecessor; but the first Winter in which he commenced the management, my Comedy, to use the technical term, was <hi>shelf'd.</hi> The vanity of a young Author was piqued; and I wrote to Mr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> in the civilest terms I could, to remonstrate on the occasion; but of my letter not the least notice was taken. As I was not then informed of Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi>'s general neglect of letters, I considered this slight as a particular insult to me, especially as the Comedy was not played again that year, but by command of their Majesties, and for the benefit of Performers. I therefore selt myself under a
<pb facs="4"/>
necessity of presenting my Tragedy at Covent-Garden; but, as I had some reason to dread Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>'s opinions, it was presented to him, in the Summer of 1777, by a Lady of Rank, with the name and sex of the Author concealed. After several weeks of anxious expectation, it was returned, peremptorily rejected. I then waited on him, and avowed the unfortunate Piece, but had little reason to flatter myself with the circumstances of my reception: Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> to d me, that there was no hope from alteration; that the Play was unfit for the Stage, and that he was convinced it never could be made fit: he disliked the whole idea of <hi>Gondibert</hi>'s situation; and thought every incident of the Fifth Act inadmissible, as he believed no audience would hear it. The last part of this opinion surprised me, as I had conceived the Fifth Act was the principal strength of the Piece; but I was compelled to submit: Nor is its <hi>rejection</hi> the injury of which I complain; had the ashes of my Tragedy rested undisturbed, I might have mourned over them; but I would have mourned in silence.</p>
<p>The Tragedy of <hi>Percy</hi> was soon after announced. I attended its representation with anxious curiosity, at this Play had been approved by that judgement which had decided so severely on mine. At the opening of the Piece, I was much concerned to see an old English story attempted, though it bore little resemblance to the legendary tales of <hi>Percy</hi> and <hi>Douglas;</hi> and that so much was said of Chivalry, and of expeditions to the Holy Land—circumstances which, though finely calculated for the Stage, had been much neglected by our Poets, in favour of the tales of Greek and Roman antiquity. Yet, as the Crusades are common historical facts, I could only consider my being in some measure anticipated, as unfortunate. But I can hardly describe my astonishment, or distress, when I saw <hi>Raby,</hi> the Father of the Heroine, appear in almost the same situation with <hi>Westmoreland;</hi> and resent his Son-in-law's imputation on the honour of his Daughter, in a train of ideas exactly similar to those which I had given to the Father of <hi>Adina;</hi> and that he even spoke several lines nearly verbatim; which will be found on comparing the two Tragedies.</p>
<p>I learnt from the Papers of next day, that <hi>Percy</hi> was a Translation from a Tragedy called <hi>Gabrielle de Vergy,</hi> written by M. <hi>Belloy.</hi> I was soon after informed, by persons who had read the original, (for I am unacquainted with the language) that in M. <hi>Belley</hi>'s Tragedy there is <hi>no Father.</hi> I had remarked, indeed, during the representation, that <hi>Raby</hi> seemed to have no connection with the plot; he was out of the way during all the business of the Play, and returned just time enough to challenge the defamer of his Daughter, and to call himself her Champion; which however neither introduces, nor retards a single event,</p>
<p><pb n="iii" facs="5"/>
Various were my conjectures on this occasion; but prudence suggested a cautious silence, as I had still hopes at Drury-Lane. Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> received me infinitely better than I expected, and regretted that I had not brought my Piece before, as Mr. <hi>Jephson</hi> and Mr. <hi>Craddock</hi> had each a Tragedy promised for the next Winter, (1778-9) which must put it off another Season; but assured me, in the most explicit terms, that no other Tragedy should come before it, provided it was proper for the Stage; which, he added in a very polite manner, he had no doubt of. He soon after received my Farce of <hi>Who's the Dupe?</hi> with equal frankness, and promised that it should be brought out in the best part of the Season, as some recompence for the delay of my Tragedy. More than satisfied, happy with my prospects, I had only to regret that I had misapprehended his neglect of my letter, and caused myself so many uneasy hours.</p>
<p>The <hi>Law of Lombardy</hi> was soon after put into Rehearsal, and I learnt, with great surprise, that it bore a resemblance to <hi>Albina</hi> in the conduct of the Piece, though not in the Story or Characters. I was greatly alarmed at the idea of more anticipation; which, whether accidental or otherwise, was destructive of every prospect of reputation or advantage to me. This resemblance was mentioned to Mr. <hi>Sheridan;</hi> and I thought myself happy when, by his interposition, Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> was prevailed on to read the Tragedy, on the suggestion that some alteration had been made; and they acknowledged that, if both Pieces were entitled to the Stage, the only means of doing justice to both, was to bring them out, at the same time, at different Houses; otherwise the novelty of one of them must be destroyed—and the idea of Rival Tragedies might be as advantageous as that of Rival Actors had been on some particular occasions. This matter, of very anxious expectation, was suspended near a month, as Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> met with great difficulty in finding the Copy of the Tragedy. In the mean-time, the speaking Pantomime of the <hi>Touchstone</hi> was brought out; and, as I was then in great good-humour with Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> I had a pleasure in endeavouring to suggest some useful alterations, and was happy when he accepted the new scene of <hi>Lady Fashion's Rout,</hi> which I considered as an earnest that he intended to accept the Tragedy. Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> at length found <hi>Albina,</hi> and I attended him by appointment. On this occasion I waited three hours, (which was rather longer than he had ever made me wait before): he came at length with the Tragedy in his hand; and I feel myself too much flattered by what he then said, to omit it, whatever length it may add to my tale.</p>
<p>He made a thousand apologies, (and in apologies for negligence Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> is remarkably easy and successful) but said he had brought the best in his hand, which was my Tragedy, saying, "I have now read every word of it. I was determined
<pb n="iv" facs="6"/>
not to see you 'till I had; and this it is that has kept me so long. Before I enter into particulars, I will tell you that I think your Tragedy a very good one; it will do you much honour, and be of service to the Theatre."On my acknowledgements, he added, "Upon my word, I really think what I say; and, without a compliment, I am surprised that such a Tragedy could have been refused. Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> must have seen it when his head was full of other business: if he had read it attentively, he could not have refused it. This Tragedy has a right to the Stage: it must and <hi>shall</hi> be done."</p>
<p>The Tragedy was then opened, and Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> shewed me several indentings against lines which he wished me to consider. He said the Characters were very strongly drawn, and the Story interesting; and frequently pointed out passages, which, on account of the Poetry, or the Thought, he was pleased to admire. The only objection of importance was, that he thought <hi>Gondibert</hi> should not see, or mention, the Bridal Bed, in the last Scene: but, on my attempting a timorous defence, he added, "Don't alter this, or any other passage, unless it strikes you as it does me; <hi>you</hi> ought to be tenacious: <hi>every original Writer must give up passages with difficulty: it is only Translators, and Borrowers, who are so ready to comply with every hint that is proposed."</hi></p>
<p>The judgement pronounced by Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> made me particularly happy, as Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> had promised, the same morning, that he would be guided by Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi>'s opinion, who said he would give the Tragedy to Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> himself, and tell him what he thought of it. This was adding favour to favour; and my thanks, I believe, sufficiently expressed my sentiments.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> a few days afterwards, took my Tragedy, as he imagined, into the country; but, on opening it, found that Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> had, by mistake, given him a Comedy. This occasioned another week's suspence: it was then however obtained and read; and I had scarce a doubt, considering every circumstance, that it would be put into immediate Rehearsal.</p>
<p>All my hopes were however confounded by Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>'s persevering with inflexible steadiness in his former opinion. He said, there had been no material alterations, (which was certainly true;) and that it was still his opinion, that the Tragedy could never be made fit for the Stage. When he was reminded that Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> entertained a very different opinion of it, he replied, "I don't believe he has read it: he may have dipped into it; but I am convinced he has not read it through." This was afterwards discussed in the presence of both, when Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> assured Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> that he had read the whole, and that it was his opinion it ought to be done; but Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> remained inflexible.</p>
<p><pb n="v" facs="7"/>
When I next saw Mr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> it was on the subject of my Farce. He observed me dispirited, and kindly taking my hand, said, "Never mind 'em; you and I will shew that <hi>we know</hi> a good Tragedy."</p>
<p>This Farce Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> had offered to take, and put into immediate Rehearsal; but, as I had then no doubt of its being played in an advantageous part of the season at Drury-Lane, I had no inducement to change the House for which it was intended. <hi>Who's the Dupe,</hi> however, in consequence of repeated breaches of appointments and promises, was not produced till the middle of the Benefits, when it could not have a regular run; and I was then to pay an Hundred Guineas (Thirty of which had been added by the present Managers) for the chance of a Benefit, at a time when the current business of the Theatre would not produce that Sum.</p>
<p>The pecuniary disappointment I did not consider as material in this instance, as I hoped that the applause with which the Farce was uniformly received, would have put an end to the difficulty of getting my Pieces on the Stage, which was infinitely more harrassing to my mind than the labour of producing them. I was however soon after greatly hurt, to hear that Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> evaded the subject when it was accidentally mentioned, and advised me to write a Comedy.—It was necessary, for this purpose, that I should have some Comic ideas; and <hi>they</hi> were all completely driven from my mind by the vexations I had undergone. I had indeed made some progress in writing a Piece founded on Turkish manners, the Scene of which is laid in Asia, and slattered myself with success from the novelty of the attempt; but it lies, and must lie, in its present state, till I have reason to believe it will meet with a fair and candid reception from the Theatres.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi>Craddock</hi>'s Tragedy was then preparing for rehearsal, and the parts given out; but another Play of Miss <hi>More</hi>'s was discovered to be nearly finished; and Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> was so eager to bring it out, though it was then near the conclusion of the season, that she has said he would hardly give her time to finish it. There was only one capital Actress at either House, who would undertake a new part in May; and, though she belonged to Drury-Lane, she was cast in Miss <hi>More</hi>'s Pray at Covent-Garden, in consequence of the levelling power of the Coalition; and Mr. <hi>Craddock</hi>'s Play was put off 'till next season.</p>
<p>Another Play by Miss <hi>More</hi> alarmed me greatly. The terror of suffering again what I had felt at <hi>Percy,</hi> induced me to write to her in much agitation; a d I am sorry that I was prevented from sending that Letter, and induced to believe it was impossible that the same palpable resemblance could again happen. Under this conviction I attended the representation, and heard with astonishment,
<pb n="vi" facs="8"/>
what appeared to me to be every essential circumstance in the Plot, and Character, of my Play; and to observe, that it was changed principally in those places which had been objected to in mine. In <hi>Orlando,</hi> as in <hi>Gondibert,</hi> the action springs from Love, which took its rise in a situation wherein Hope was impossible; though the object is changed, from the Widow of his Brother, to the betrothed Mistress of his Friend.</p>
<p>The character and offices of <hi>Editha</hi> were given, though the sex was changed. From the same motive of aggrandizing his fortune, though without the same stimulus of a degraded situation, he worms himself into the considence of the despairing Lover, and persuades him that he is secretly beloved by <hi>Isabella,</hi> whilst she receives the addresses of another. <hi>Orlando</hi> breaks into a rhapsody similar to that of <hi>Gondibert,</hi> persuades himself he had seen many proofs of that concealed passion, and gives himself up to the guidance of his artful Counsellor; which produces a catastrophe that is nearly the same. <hi>Orlando,</hi> in the dark, intending to stab <hi>Rivers,</hi> by a fortunate mistake stabs <hi>Bertrand;</hi> and the principal situation of the catastrophe is produced exactly in the same manner in both Plays; which is, by the critical entrance of the person supposed to be murdered. The greater part of this, however, passes behind the scenes in <hi>Fatal Falsehood;</hi> by which the dramatic effect is weakened; but the principal objections made to mine, are removed. The character of the Sister of <hi>Rivers,</hi> and other parts of the Play, differ from mine; but there is a scene between the Father and his Daughter, on her being rejected by <hi>Orlando,</hi> that bears the same resemblance, in the literal expression, to the scene between <hi>Westmoreland</hi> and <hi>Albina,</hi> in the fourth Act of this Play, as the scene in <hi>Percy</hi> did to that between him and <hi>Edward.</hi></p>
<p>How all these wonderful resemblances happened, it is impossible for me to know—nor do I know that Miss <hi>More</hi> ever saw my Tragedy—it was in Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi>'s possession (under the name of <hi>Edwina)</hi> soon after the conclusion of the season in which he he left the Stage; about which time, I have since been informed, Miss <hi>More</hi> was an inmate at Hampton, and that the Play, afterwards called <hi>Percy,</hi> was then translating. My Tragedy was afterwards in Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>'s Closet, at the same time with <hi>Percy,</hi> and again nearly at the same time with <hi>Fatal Falsehood.</hi> I know that Managers are continually employed in giving advice, and in suggesting alternations to Authors; and I have frequently heard, before I had any experience in this anxious warfare, of the danger when once an idea is afloat in the Theatrical Hemisphere, of its getting into other plays. Amidst the croud of Plots, and Stage Contrivances, in which a Manager is involv'd, <hi>recollection</hi> is too frequently mistaken for the suggestions of <hi>imagination.</hi></p>
<p><pb n="vii" facs="9"/>
Should it, after all, appear to the Public, that there is nothing more in these repeated resemblances, than what may be accounted for by supposing a similarity in our minds; and that, by some <hi>wonderful</hi> coincidence, Miss <hi>More</hi> and I have but one common stock of ideas between us, I have only to lament that the whole misfortune of this similarity has fallen upon me: and, as in this case, we must continue writing in the same track, it seems reasonable that we should have our productions brought forward in turn; instead of which Miss <hi>More</hi> has had two Tragedies brought out, both of which were written since mine, whilst I struggled for the representation of this, in vain. But, as there seems to be little hope of my obtaining this, or any other favour, from the Winter Managers, I presume at least, that, as I do not pretend to prove—what it is impossible for me to know—that Miss <hi>More</hi> ever read, or copied me, that it will be admitted that I have not copied her; had I not been able to ascertain the fact, that my Tragedy was written long before <hi>Percy</hi> and <hi>Fatal Falsehood</hi> appeared, no proof would have been required, beyond their extreme similarity, that I had been guilty of the grossest Plagiarism.</p>
<p>I now found myself deprived of all hope of <hi>Albina</hi>'s appearing to the Public as an Original Play; yet I still conceived myself sure of its being represented at Drury-Lane the next Season: but I soon after accidentally learnt, that Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> had promised another Tragedy; and, as Mr. <hi>Craddock</hi>'s had been put off, I well knew that three would not be done:—this, with his evading the subject, and saying that he thought Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> would still do it, reduced me to the disagreeable necessity of asking an explicit declaration, when I heard with inexpressible astonishment—"That he neyer intended to do the Play at Drury-Lane, and that the next Season was engaged to Mr. <hi>Craddock,</hi> and another Gentleman."On being reminded of his promises and encomiums, he said—"It was still his opinion, that the Tragedy was a very good one, that it ought not to have been refused, and that he had proposed to prevail on Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> after all to bring it out; but, as this had been improperly mentioned to Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> there was now an end of it." I was then charged with having pieced conversations together, which Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> said should never happen again; and, from the whole of his behaviour, it appeared to me that he meant this to close his doors against me.</p>
<p>This most injurious and unaccountable conduct appears to me to be the effect of that coalition of the Theatres, which, by uniting the interests and prejudices of the Managers, deprives an Author of all hope, after a Piece has been rejected by <hi>one.</hi> Had Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> been unconnected with Covent-Garden, I have no doubt, from the opinion he conceived of my Tragedy, but that it would have been brought out in a most advantageous
<pb n="viii" facs="10"/>
manner. Ideas of rivalship, which is the natural and proper effect of two Houses, would have been as favourable to me, as their union has been ruinous.</p>
<p>The morning succeeding my interview with Mr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was asked to bring out a Tragedy for me, at the Haymarket, which both the Winter Managers had refused. His answer was—<hi>When an Author of reputation thinks proper to bring me a Piece, I don't think I have a right to deliberate. If Mrs.</hi> Cowley <hi>invites the Town to a Tragedy at the Haymarket, I am only the Midwife, to give it a safe delivery to the World; when one does not know a Writer, it is different.</hi></p>
<p>This candid and liberal answer I have great pleasure in recording. The Tragedy, when read, drew an approbation not less warm from Mr. <hi>Colman,</hi> than from Mr. <hi>Sheridan:</hi> and it was not merely praise; Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> put it into immediate rehearsal, for which I think myself under the highest obligation, as Tragedy is inconsistent with the sportive Genius of the <hi>Haymarket;</hi> and there was little hope of advantage equal to the expensive preparation of a regular Tragedy. It was however presented, with no other alteration than the curtailments, which were necessary, on account of the length, where the time of representation is shorter than in the Winter Theatres—and with the disadvantage of having one of its principal <note n="*" place="foot"><hi>Editha;</hi> since given to Miss <hi>Sherry.</hi></note> Characters performed in a style which excited laughter; yet it was received with a degree of applause, for which I should be ungrateful, were I not vain of it.</p>
<p>Had I taken up my pen merely in pursuit of applause, I should have been completely gratified; but this, though so ostentatiously held out as the motive for productions in the Poetic line, has seldom, in any age or country, produced works of any considerable reputation. Dramatic Writers, in particular, have always sought for support from their labour, which is too great to be undertaken for amusement. This may appear a vulgar topic; but to me it is a very serious subject of complaint, that, by the conduct of the Winter Managers, I have been deprived of a reasonable prospect of several hundred pounds, and have spent years of fruitless anxiety and trouble. My productions have been uniformly received by the Public with applause; yet I find the doors of the Winter Theatres shut against me.—To this severe fate I most reluctantly submit.</p>

<l>Extorted—all she ask'd—a smile from You;</l>
<l>Her grateful mind a new-born ardor caught,</l>
<l>A loftier fancy, and sublimer thought;</l>
<l>To her rapt eye the Martial Ages rose;</l>
<l>And, as her Muse impell'd, her Story flows.</l>
<l>'Tis true, she calls you from the tempting shade,</l>
<l>The zephyr'd meadow, and the leafy glade;</l>
<l>And not to cheer with Satire's poignant hit,</l>
<l>Ironic Humour, or the flash of Wit.</l>
<l>Her wand she waves; and, instant to your eyes</l>
<l>Tempestuous passions, guilty deeds, arise!</l>
<l>For these our Author's magic line was drawn;</l>
<l>For these she bids you from the fragrant lawn:—</l>
<l>To rend with fear, to melt with tender woe,</l>
<l>And bid the graceful drops of pity flow.</l>
<l>Majestic <hi>Nature</hi>'s plan she follows there,</l>
<l>Who, when thick vapours clog the sultry air,</l>
<l><pb facs="13"/>
When glowing Sirius, from his fervid eye,</l>
<l>Sends noxious languors through the sick'ning sky,</l>
<l>Arous'd—amidst her THUNDERS she appears,</l>
<l>And in terrific grandeur strikes our ears!</l>
<l>The wide-stretch'd concave blackens with her ire;</l>
<l>Through lab'ring aether darts the living fire;</l>
<l>The heav'ns, the earth, all aid her mighty rage,</l>
<l>And elements with wrathful elements engage!</l>
<l>Then—whilst the trembling world is lost in fears—</l>
<l>She melts the lurid clouds in healthful tears.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l><hi>Your</hi> tears we mean to prompt, whilst You, secure</l>
<l>Amidst the coming storm, the wreck endure:</l>
<l>Harmless <hi>our</hi> tempest roars within this pale,</l>
<l>Whilst ventilators catch the cooling gale.</l>
<l>But, should a tempest in <hi>your</hi> quarter rise,</l>
<l>'Twould scare us more than thunder in the skies▪</l>
<l>Guiltless to <hi>You</hi> the storm within these doors;</l>
<l>Do You then save <hi>us</hi> harmless, Sirs! from yours.</l>

<l>BEAR back my duty to my royal Master;</l>

<l><hi>—Yet</hi> would I hope the flying rumour false.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
<l>Too well, my Lord, the tidings are confirm'd;</l>
<l>Again the sacrilegious Turk hath broke</l>
<l>The peace he ask'd—again the Crescent's rear'd</l>
<l>Upon the Holy Plains, whilst yellow streamers,</l>
<l>Fann'd by the wanton air, which late embrac'd</l>
<l>The Christian standard, to the world proclaim</l>
<l>The impious war.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>Give back the years, O Time!</l>
<l>When such a tale as this had fir'd my soul,</l>
<l>And sped me to th'unrighteous camp, on wings</l>
<l>Of holy zeal! The fire's not yet extinct,</l>
<l>But cank'ring age the sinews of my youth</l>
<l>Hath eat away.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="16"/>
<speaker>GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
<l>Be not thus thankless to an age,</l>
<l>Which in its slow advance, to gain a welcome,</l>
<l>Brought honours, triumphs, and a nation's love!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>Forbear! Thou com'st a messenger of war;</l>
<l>Away then with the flatt'ring arts of peace,</l>
<l>And deal in words more suited to the times!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
<l>Your pardon, Lord! Know then, the King in haste</l>
<l>Orders his vet'ran Nobles to attend him.</l>
<l>A powerful army he'll in person lead</l>
<l>To Asia's plains. Ten thousand choicest warriors</l>
<l>Mean time are his precursors to the field,</l>
<l>Led on by him they love—the gallant Edward—</l>
<l>Who, ere the down of youth forfook his cheek,</l>
<l>Deeds had perform'd that laurell'd age might envy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>His manhood will fulfill his youth's fair promise—</l>
<l>—A star, or I mistake, which rose in splendor,</l>
<l>And will in glory set. Had Heaven bestow'd</l>
<l>On me a son like him, without regret</l>
<l>I'd sink into the arms of nerveless age;</l>
<l>Count <hi>his</hi> exploits, grow vain upon his conquests;</l>
<l>And, when my Country claim'd her ancient warrior,</l>
<l>I'd proudly show my Son.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
<l>Though from your prayers a Son hath been witheld,</l>
<l>A Daughter was bestow'd, so rich in graces,</l>
<l>So excellent in mind—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>She's my heart's darling—</l>

<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>Welcome, young Hero! I partake the transports</l>
<l>Which this high honour, this unsought command,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>My Lord!</l>

<sp>

<l>How's this! have I misread your heart?</l>
<l>Now, whilst our fiery youth are all in arms,</l>

<l>Edward, as if oppress'd with maiden shame,</l>
<l>Blushing, averts his head—</l>

<l>Well may I blush!</l>
<l>The Soldier, chosen by the King, to lead</l>
<l>His warlike bands, and carry Britain's thunder</l>
<l>To holy Zion's gates—he whose rapt bosom,</l>
<l>No flame, but glory, should confess—</l>
<l>—He stands before you, with a fainting heart,</l>
<l>To tell a tale—of love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>The time's unapt;</l>
<l>Yet 'tis a tale at which a Soldier needs not blush.</l>
<l>He, who most ardent in the sanguine field,</l>
<l>Contemning danger, braves the whizzing storm;</l>
<l>He is most fit to storm a Maid's reluctance,</l>
<l>He best deserves the happiness of love.</l>

<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>This, from a Hero's mouth, warrants my sighs.</l>
<l>Edward no longer then shall fear to own</l>
<l>The power of silken tresses, and fair eyes:</l>
<l>But, Westmoreland! with equal patience hear</l>
<l>That she, who in my heart hath rais'd this flame—</l>
<l>—She, who doth pityless receive its sighs,</l>
<l>Is matchless Raimond—is thy beauteous Daughter!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>Heaven, I thank thee! <stage>[aside.]</stage> Is this a sudden passion,</l>
<l>Bred from the fever of hot youthful blood?</l>
<l>Or kindled by some casual glance?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Oh no!</l>
<l>A faithful Love—with my existence twisted;</l>
<l>Nor know I when th'attachment first began.</l>
<l>Deep in my heart she'd fix'd her beauteous image</l>
<l>When, by my father sent, I England left</l>
<l>For distant lands.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>So early!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>E'en so early.</l>
<l>Ere glory or ambition touch'd my breast,</l>
<l>Albina fill'd it with resistless love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>Had you disclos'd your passion to my Daughter?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>If the unartful language of mine eyes</l>
<l>Disclos'd the tale, she knew I was her slave;</l>
<l>But youthful bashfulness seal'd up my lips:</l>
<l>And when I left—reluctant—Albion's shores,</l>
<l>Not one soft glance my longing eye could catch</l>
<l>To sooth the raging passion in my breast.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="19"/>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>But Gallia's shores a ready cure bestow'd:</l>
<l><hi>Her</hi> beauties kindly heal the wounds they give,</l>
<l>Nor let their lovers <hi>languish</hi> in their chains.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>In vain the beauties of the Gallic Court</l>
<l>Spread out their nets—In vain the dames of Italy</l>
<l>Display'd their charms—Impatient I return'd</l>
<l>To lay my heart at your Albina's feet—</l>
<l>—Oh day of horror! She was wife of Raimond!</l>
<l>Fury, despair, seiz'd my distracted mind—</l>
<l>I curs'd his fortune, curs'd myself, and loath'd</l>
<l>His hated name—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>Young Lord, you do forget</l>
<l>Earl Raimond was my Son—the chosen Husband</l>
<l>To whom <hi>I</hi> gave Albina.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Oh pardon, Sir, the transports of my grief,</l>
<l>Which, at this <hi>distant</hi> period, shake my frame,</l>
<l>And guess from them what Edward hath endur'd!</l>
<l>Earl Raimond's arms, and mine, against the Saracens</l>
<l>Our monarch did command—and then I <hi>prov'd</hi></l>
<l>That I was <hi>worthy</hi> of Albina's hand.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>Your valiant acts by fame have been proclaim'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Of fame, of valour, 'tis not that I boast,</l>
<l>'Tis not the prowess of my arm in war,</l>
<l>'Tis of a deed a Roman might have claim'd,</l>
<l>And you will thank—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>You warm my expectation.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>'Twas on a day, when truce had been proclaim'd,</l>
<l>I pass'd beyond the lines t'observe the foe.</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="20"/>
Directed by the gleams of burnish'd mail,</l>
<l>Within the bosom of a tufted thicket,</l>
<l>Three Saracens, waging unequal fight</l>
<l>Against one English warrior, I espy'd.</l>
<l>My bounding courser bore me to the spot—</l>
<l>There Raimond I beheld, o'erpow'r'd and prone:</l>
<l>Lifting this temper'd sword, I cleft the arm</l>
<l>Which, aiming at his heart, had instant pierc'd it—</l>
<l>He rose with strength renew'd, and we grew victors.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>Talk not of <hi>Roman,</hi> 'twas a <hi>Briton</hi>'s act,</l>
<l>And well became a Christian warrior.</l>
<l>Go to Albina—boldly speak your passion—</l>
<l>She must, she shall, reward thy truth and honour!</l>
<l>Tell her, her Father doth approve thy suit,</l>
<l>And speeds thee, with his wishes, to her heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>For this, O noble Westmoreland! I thank thee;</l>
<l>But vainly I've assail'd with warmest vows</l>
<l>Albina's heart: Sorrow, like a chill atmosphere,</l>
<l>The beauteous dame surrounds, quenching each dart—</l>
<l>Each burning dart of love.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>Oh, you've not yet been vers'd in women's ways.</l>
<l>You, who can brave Bellona, when she shakes</l>
<l>Her iron locks, I warrant, are dismay'd</l>
<l>At Beauty's frown, and tremble if she sweeps</l>
<l>Her train in scorn: But you must learn t'o'erlook</l>
<l>An hundred follies—vanity behold</l>
<l>In every shifting form, and yet be pleas'd—</l>
<l>Still patiently admire, or never hope</l>
<l>to win fantastic woman.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Oh, such services</l>
<l>Albina never claim'd; yet, if she did,</l>
<l>Whole years I'd spend to gratify her taste,</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="21"/>
And would be any thing to please her phantasy—</l>
<l>But now, to those sweet homages which Love</l>
<l>Delights to pay, a cruel period's fix'd—</l>
<l>Within three days, England I quit for Palestine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>'Tis a short period. It will scarcely serve</l>
<l>To break a piece of gold, or carve her name,</l>
<l>With your's entwin'd, on some young willow's bark.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Ah, my good Lord, treat not my griefs thus lightly!</l>
<l>For if I leave your Daughter, Raimond's widow,</l>
<l>I go to certain death—if Edward's Bride,</l>
<l>I will return in triumph to her arms,</l>
<l>Lay my proud laurels at Albina's feet,</l>
<l>And seek no future glory, but her love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WESTMORELAND.</speaker>
<l>Well, to my Daughter I will plead your cause.</l>
<l>This do I owe the love your Father bore me,</l>
<l>And to the fame your virtues have attain'd—</l>
<l>Here meet me in an hour, and hope success.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>This—this, O Westmoreland! I dar'd to hope;</l>
<l>Yet joy and gratitude, like fires confin'd,</l>
<l>Struggle within my heart for room—for utterance—</l>
<l>My tongue, unus'd to descant on felicity,</l>
<l>Denies its words—yet trust to me—</l>
</sp>

<l>Why shines the sun thus <hi>gaily</hi> on the world?</l>

<l>To griefs like mine,</l>
<l>Time brings no lenient balm. Each dawning day</l>

<l>Born, Adela, to an exalted rank,</l>
<l>Bright pomp attending on my early years,</l>
<l>And blessings springing round me as I trod—</l>
<l>—Oh! thou should'st wonder that my swelling soul</l>
<l>Can stoop a moment to this vile dependence—</l>
<l>—It cannot stoop! Misfortune bears upon me,</l>

<l>Reason! Distraction!</l>

<l>When you, my Lord, did study in the schools,</l>
<l>I've heard you much of Reason talk, Philosophy,</l>
<l>And Virtue—now, when all their force you want,</l>
<l>You spurn them, with a blind contempt, away.</l>

<l>They have <hi>no</hi> force, <hi>no</hi> pow'r, beyond the schools</l>

<l>Oh! were she <hi>not</hi> my Sister!—Egbert, Egbert!</l>
<l>I could turn girl, to think on what I've lost—</l>
<l>—But two short days before my Brother's marriage,</l>
<l>I from the war return'd; and the first hour</l>
<l>She met my ravish'd eyes—was at the altar.</l>

<l>Will she not wed again?—</l>
<l>I could have borne my life without more bliss</l>
<l>Than the soft rights which custom gives a Brother;</l>
<l>To see her ev'ry day—to fix my eyes,</l>
<l>Whole hours, with doating love, upon her face—</l>
<l>To feast my ears with the bewitching music</l>

<l>Impossible!</l>

<l>The public voice condemns your eager marriage;</l>

<l>Where's the proud Dame, whose glory would not be</l>
<l>Lord Edward's love? Is there a fame so bright</l>

<l>Where you, a Mars, the living canvas shews;</l>
<l>And for a while, with ardent gaze, survey'd it—</l>
<l>Saying, "Had I the pencil held, that helmet</l>
<l>Had been Love's chaplet; and the uncouth armour</l>
<l>Upon those graceful limbs, bright Hymen's flow'ry robe".</l>

<l>They suit too well the tenor of my mind!</l>
<l>Edward, alas! thou seest, no happy Bridegroom,</l>
<l>With ardor waiting, and impatient joy,</l>

</sp>

<l>He is already found. Thy thin-drawn arts</l>

<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>This rude, intemp'rate anger, will not heal</l>
<l>Thy Daughter's shame. I tell thee, thou fierce Lord?</l>

<l>What! prove Albina in the face of day</l>
<l>A wanton!—Her, on whose pure chastity,</l>
<l>Within a few short hours, I would have stak'd</l>
<l>My everlasting weal!—Oh, thou fallen Angel!</l>
<l>I'll mourn thy fault, but in my heart 'tis buried!</l>

<l>All this might cozen a fond female's anger;</l>

<l>In our long line of noble ancestry,</l>
<l>Not one base act e'er spotted the fair name,</l>
<l>Or slander dared to breathe on't!</l>
<l>Unsullied I receiv'd the glorious heritance,</l>
<l>And will, untarnish'd, bear it through the world.</l>
<l>Thou hast defam'd my child—Her who will bear</l>

<l>My Liege! <hi>I</hi> answer the demand. Lord Edward</l>
<l>Did yesterday, with humble suit, entreat</l>
<l>That in his favour I would move my Daughter—</l>
<l>—Feigning true passion, and unequall'd love.</l>
<l>With warm regard I did accept the charge,</l>

<l>This morn was fix'd, by hymeneal rites</l>

This very morn, whilst I, with joy impatient,</l>
<l>Prepar'd to hail him Son—</l>
<l>He came, with slander charg'd—breathing base falsehoods</l>
<l>To stain her name, and gloss the violation</l>
<l>Of his pledg'd faith—Therefore I challenge Edward!</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>This charge, by Westmoreland's good Earl alledg'd,</l>
<l>We have, with wonder and concern, attended.</l>
<l>'Mongst the bright Ladies who adorn our court,</l>
<l>Not one so peerless stands as Countess Raimond;</l>
<l>Not one whose fame more fitly suits her birth;</l>
<l>Nor one whose honour more becomes her fame.</l>
<l>Why then, Lord Edward, hast thou, causeless, stain'd it?</l>

<l>Might have beheld thee wear with envy?</l>

<l>That Raimond's chastity I held unquestion'd,</l>
<l>As the high myst'ries of our holy faith.</l>

<l>That I aspir'd to greatness, and perceiv'd</l>

<l>Yet they have left a mind defies their vengeance—</l>
<l>Which, though these limbs were lock'd in bolts of steel,</l>
<l>And darkness wrapt these precious founts of light,</l>

<l>He for whom I'm exil'd, for exil'd Gondibert</l>
<l>Shall weep with his heart's blood; and ev'ry vein</l>
