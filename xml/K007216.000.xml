<p>UNDONE! ruined! and undone, past redemption.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I wish you had not writ that letter to Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> to desire him to come back to Madrid.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Who could divine that my brother would return from Naples, without giving me any notice of his intention; and that he should come at so critical a juncture?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Well, Ma'am, I always thought your writing to Don Carlos would come to no good.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Let me hear no more of your prate, I beseech you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Do you think, Ma'am, Don <hi>Carlos</hi> will be here to-night?</p>

<p>I expected him last night, you know, and shall expect every moment, 'till I hear farther from him.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Softly, here is my brother.</p>
<p><stage>(<hi>Enter</hi> Don PEDRO.)</stage> You seem uneasy: has any thing happened to vex you while you were abroad?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p><hi>Leonarda,</hi> leave the room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside)</stage> With all my heart; I am very glad to be out of the way.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>You know, sister, when our father died, a very considerable succession devolved to me: however, being then with my regiment at Naples, I did not come to take possession, but left every thing to your care and management.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>I hope, you have had no reason to repent—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>Pray hear me out. A particular friend writ me word, that in the month of April last, you left your lodgings, with Don <hi>Alonzo,</hi> nephew to Don <hi>Guzman;</hi> and that while you were walking together on the Prado, Don <hi>Carlos</hi> came up, charged him sword in hand, and killed him on the spot. In a word, it is this intelligence that has brought me to Madrid.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> LEONARDA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Sir, the relation of Don <hi>Guzman,</hi> is below, and he desires to be admitted to you.</p>

<p>Don <hi>Ferdinand!</hi> shew him up.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>Sister, retire into the next room for a few minutes; and I desire that what has just now passed between us, may go no farther to any one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Softly, as they are going out.)</stage> Well, Ma'am, what was it he had to tell you?</p>

<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Oh, <hi>Leonarda,</hi> he knows all.</p>

<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> I rejoice to find you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>Your air speaks a mind in agitation; what's the matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Don <hi>Carlos</hi> is at this very moment in Madrid.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>How do you know?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>I just now saw him muffled up in the street: I immediately gave a servant the word, and he has dogged him, and his man, to a little inn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>You are positive you saw Don <hi>Carlos?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Positive. Now, as I am shortly to be married to my cousin, it is highly incumbent upon me to render myself acceptable to my uncle; and, I am certain, I can do nothing more likely to please him, than taking vengance on Don <hi>Carlos.</hi> I therefore expect that you will accompany me to the place where the servant is ready to lead us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>Most willingly. <hi>Lopez,</hi> my sword. Is your man below?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>He waits at the door to conduct us.</p>

<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Very terrible things, to be sure Ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Don <hi>Carlos</hi> is arrived at Madrid, and my brother is gone to kill, or deliver him up to justice. I should have called them back, fallen at their feet

<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>How now!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Bell rings again.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>As I hope to be saved, I heard the little bell ring below; he's come here, and is now at the garden-door.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>

<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Fly quick, good <hi>Leonarda,</hi> fly. If this be so, I am happy; and may still preserve him from the malice of his enemies.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>Beautiful <hi>Aurora,</hi> I find myself alive, but in the pleasure of seeing you once again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Oh, <hi>Carlos! Carlos!</hi> my brother arrived here, from Italy, yesterday.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>Your brother!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>I had no notice of his coming; otherwise I should have apprised you, that you might have deferred your journey, at least for some time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>It will be impossible for me to stay in your house then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Not so.—I have prepared a retreat for you, where his utmost cunning will never be able to find you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Ma'am, but the constables—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Nor they, neither—hear my lady out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>This house consists, like many others in Madrid, but of two stories: the upper, I occupy myself; the lower, which, on my father's death, I found I had no occasion for, I let to one Octavio, a wine-merchant; on this division of the building, a back staircase, which made the communication between the two stories, with a small closet adjoining, became useless; and, by mutual
<pb n="9" facs="8"/>consent, was stopped up, by a partition on the side of the apartment below, as well as on this. When I had thoughts of bringing you back to Madrid, it occurred to me, that the partition on my side might again be secretly opened, and prepared in such a manner, as would effectually screen you from any search, should it ever be suspected that you were in the house: accordingly, the thing is done, <hi>(pushes back a pannel,</hi> and this moveable pannel will, when you please, admit you into a place of security; and, when fastened on the in—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p><hi>Aurora,</hi> I have too grateful a sense of your kindness, to avail myself of a retreat, which must expose you. In this emergency, the best way is to return to the place from whence I came.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>That's my advice, Sir; let us go to the inn directly, take our mules, and set off.—Ladies, my master, and I, have the honour of wishing you all health and happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Oh! hold, Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> you must not go.—You have, by some accident or other, been seen, since you came to Madrid, by young <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> His servant dogg'd you to your inn; and he, and my brother, are just gone in search of you.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Knocking.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Oh, heavens, Ma'am!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>Don't be alarm'd; we have arms to desend ourselves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>No, no, ladies, don't be alarmed. We have arms to defend ourselves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Talk not of defence, I beseech you; but in pity to me, go into the place I have shewn you: and we will consult together for your better and safer accommodation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>What the lady says, Sir, is just and reasonable—I have considered the matter; and, if
<pb n="10" facs="9"/>you don't do it, I'll give myself up to justice immediately, and try to be admitted king's evidence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>I'll do any thing for your safety.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Here, here, get you in. The closet's on the left hand, where you'll find a bed and a pallet; and, for your lives, don't come out upon any account whatsoever.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>No, upon no account—Come, let us go into the next room.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit.</hi> [<hi>D.</hi> Car. Musk. <hi>go behind Pannel.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Peeping out)</stage> Hip, Signora <hi>Leonarda,</hi> I have not eat a mouthful to-day—won't you leave us a bottle and a crust?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>In, in, in,</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter Don</hi> PEDRO <hi>and Don</hi> FERDINAND, <hi>sheathing their swords.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>So, at length we are got into, at least, a temporary shelter. Who is the person I have wounded?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>I think some one said, the secretary of the Duke of Medina.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter a Servant.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>Sir, Signor <hi>Octavio,</hi> the wine-merchant below, desires to speak to you.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> OCTAVIO.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>I understand, Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> you have had a scuffle in the street; you are known; and the person you have wounded, is the Duke of Medina himself; who was going, incog, to the lodgings of a courtezan in the quarter where you affaulted him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>Fatal accident!—the Duke himself!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Why do you stand like one confounded? Do you not hear what Signor <hi>Octavio</hi> says? You
<pb n="11" facs="10"/>and your family must be gone from hence; I will stay behind, and see your lodgings let with all possible diligence, to prevent suspicion of your being in town.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>If you will commit the key of your apartments to my charge, I will do my utmost to quash whatever enquiries may be made after you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Gives a key)</stage> Get a coach to the garden door. <hi>Leonarda!</hi> sister! I must dispose of them in safety, the first thing I do.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Octavio.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> AURORA <hi>and</hi> LEONARDA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>What are your commands?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>To tell you that Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> came hither just now, to desire I would accompany him on an affair of honour; that we have missed the person we went in search of, and by mistake affulted the Duke of Medina.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir, and what—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>I must withdraw immediately to a place of safety: a coach is at the door, and I will see you and your maid safely lodged in the Ursuline nunnery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>I have told you that my safety requires I should absent myself, and I will not leave you behind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I'm sure I'll not go into a nunnery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>Then I'm sure you shall go into the street.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage> What will become of Don <hi>Carlos?</hi></p>
</sp>
<stage>(A noise behind.)</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> OCTAVIO, <hi>who signifies the coach is ready.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>Hark! the officers—look to the door, <hi>Octavio.</hi></p>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Octavio.</stage>
<p><pb n="12" facs="11"/>
Come, give me both your hands—Nay, no struggling!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Well but, Sir, brother, let me speak to you. Was there ever so unfortunate a creature!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt.</stage>
<stage>Enter <hi>OCTAVIO,</hi> and three Alguaziles; two of whom search about.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>Come in, gentlemen, come in, and welcome; but why force the door?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st. Off.</speaker>
<p>I want a gentleman, called Don <hi>Pedro;</hi> my people understand these are his lodgings: he has wounded a gentleman in the street.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>Don <hi>Pedro!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st. Off.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay: you know him well enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>I knew a sister of his, who had these lodgings; but, she has been gone from them some time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st. Off.</speaker>
<p><stage>(to his people)</stage> Well, have you found any one?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d. Off.</speaker>
<p>No, they have been too cunning for us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>Upon my credit, that Don <hi>Pedro</hi> you look for, is not here; he has been in Italy these three quarters of a year. Please to accept a couple of doubloons. You must certainly have been imposed upon.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Gives money.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>1st. Off.</speaker>
<p>To be sure, as you say the gentleman is not here, we'll take your word. I see he is not here. Come along, comrades.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt Officers.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>Let me lock this door before I go out.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Don GUZMAN.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p><hi>Octavio,</hi> your servant, alas!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>I find then, Sir, your nephew has told me all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>I am come to talk to you about these lodgings. I suppose you would let this tenement a
<pb n="13" facs="12"/>bargain, to any one, that would take it off your hands?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>To be sure, Sir, on an occasion like this—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Well, if twenty dollars a month will be sufficient, I will e'en hire the premises for my own use, and take possession directly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>Surely, Sir, twenty dollars are too little.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Well, but consider, it's doing the young man a favor; for seeing my family in the house, would prevent further enquiries, and satisfy the police, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>I really think, Sir, that, as your chief motive for taking the apartment is to serve Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> the sooner you and your family come into it, the better.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>I am of that opinion too; and as very luckily my time is just up where I now lodge, and I want some larger rooms, in consequence of my daughter's marriage, which I shall shortly celebrate, I shall send to you for the key, within this half hour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oct.</speaker>
<p>You will oblige me, Don <hi>Guzman,</hi> by charging yourself with the key now; for having a small vineyard near town, I have shut up my apartments below, and sent all my servants, men and women, to work there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>And you want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, well, go your ways, and mind your business; I'll take the key from you.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt.</stage>
<stage>Don <hi>CARLOS</hi> and <hi>MUSKATO</hi> come from behind the pannel.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>They are gone out again, and have locked the door upon us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>Did you hear all that has passed, <hi>Muskato?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, every word of it; but don't grow desperate; things are not so bad as we expected; this is a respite at least, if not a reprieve.</p>

<p>A respite! Has not Don <hi>Guzman</hi> taken this house over my head, and am I not by that means in the hands of my most cruel and avowed enemy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, but he does not know you are in his hands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>The worst on't is, that the merchant below is gone out, with his family, and has lock'd up the doors: so that our retreat is stopped. By forcing the lock of the door, we may get out before our enemy returns: I know the danger of shewing myself at this hour, but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, nothing is so dangerous as staying here, if we can get out; so, pray let us force the door; I have broke a lock before now, upon a less justifiable occasion; and I'll do my endeavour to master this— <stage>(goes to the door, and returns in a fright.)</stage> Quick, Sir, quick; back to our hiding place.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>What's the matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Don <hi>Guzman</hi>'s people are in the house; come here, and hide yourself, and ask no questions.
<stage>(They get behind the pannel.)</stage></p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> BEATRICE, <hi>and</hi> LAZARILLO.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>And so, these are the lodgings we are in such a hurry to leave our old ones for?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Ay; how do you like them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Like them, not at all. In the first place, that door has not common sense in it; then the stairs are the wrong way; and the windows! mercy on us, what pigeon-holes! and a mile and a half from the ground.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Ay, there's the fault; you want to be gaping and staring into the street.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p><hi>Lazarillo,</hi> run to the old gentleman, and tell him, if he has not already signed the agreement,
<pb n="15" facs="14"/>he must by no means take this house.—I hear a each; sure it is not my lady already?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>But it is though; you had better tell her you don't like the house,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>So I shall, I promise you.</p>
<p><stage><hi>Enter</hi> MARCELLA.</stage> La, Ma'am, you are in great haste; I did not expect to see you these three hours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>I set out to oblige my father; nothing would satisfy him, but I must come directly, to see the apartments.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>If the kennel was mine, I should think of nothing but pulling it down, and selling the rubbish to the best bidder. Take a ready furnish'd house, indeed!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Beatrice is difficult to please, Ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>So she is indeed—my father tells me, Lazarillo, that it is to please your master, he takes these lodgings; and I suppose it is by his desire that we come to them so suddenly. Do you know the reason of Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s extraordinary attachment?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Why, Ma'am, I am generally pretty well acquainted with my master's secrets.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>I beg your pardon; I did not know it was any secret, or I should not have asked.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Ma'am, there's no secret; that is to say, no absolute secret: but, as far as this here, Ma'am, the air and situation, I believe—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>In short, Ma'am, Signor <hi>Lazarillo</hi> is a person who seldom chuses to seem ignorant of any thing. Did your master ever tell you why he liked these longings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>I can't say he ever did.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Look you there, Ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Well, Mrs. <hi>Beatrice,</hi> I did not speak to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Never mind her, <hi>Lazarillo,</hi> but go and take care of these things I brought in the coach</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Lazarillo.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Beatrice!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Ma'am, here I am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>I feel myself very unhappy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>O fye, Ma'am, to tell me so, on the eve of your marriage, as it were.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>'Tis the thought of that makes me melancholy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Is it indeed? I'm sure then, Ma'am, you and I are of very different dispositions—I wish I was going to be married; the deuce a thing should I think of, but that would make me very glad.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>How, Beatrice! suppose you were going to set out upon a journey, which presented you with the most beautiful prospect; but on the first advances you made, you found yourself on the brink of a precipice, what would you do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>A very great precipice, do you mean; or, only a little sort of a declivity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! I'm not in a jesting humour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Well, but, Ma'am, let me understand you.—You ask me, if I was going to set out on a journey, which presented me with the most beautiful prospect; and, on the first advances I made, I found myself on the brink of a precipice—what I would do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Ay.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Why then, Ma'am, I'll tell you—In case it was not a very ugly precipice indeed, I would muster up all my strength—shut my eyes, so—and give a great jump.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>In short, Beatrice, my cousin, Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>—</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>How happy am I, to arrive at a moment when you pronounce my name!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>I had just begun to talk to Beatrice, when your coming into the room, interrupted me—I will take up the discourse again, if you please; and finish what I was going to say to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>I am content.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Stand there then, Sir; and we'll proceed in our discourse, as if you were fifty miles off—Come, Ma'am, begin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>I say then, <hi>Beatrice,</hi> my cousin, Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> no doubt imagines that marriage is a dispensation from the trifling duties, exacted by complaisance, since he already begins to fail in those marks of tenderness and regard, I expected to find from him—he forgets that love is nourished by attention; and that the slightest negligence kills it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Ah, dear <hi>Marcella,</hi> did you know how uneasy you make me by this kind of discourse—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>And why uneasy?—what I spoke, was said to <hi>Beatrice</hi>—and you need take no notice of it, as you need not be supposed to overhear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>That's right Ma'am—and to let you know another thing, Sir, you are not to take the words out of my mouth—my lady spoke to me; and it's my part to answer—and here's the way I do it—I suppose, Ma'am Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> is like the rest of his sex; who for the most part, follow women as they hunt hares and foxes; when the animal's catched, the sport is over.—I once had a sweetheart myself, Ma'am, that used to call me his queen, and his Venus and his Adonis—To be sure I used him very ill, then he used to be so melancholy, so pathetical, so poetical. I remember his once repeating to me these very moving lines—</p>
<pb n="18" facs="17"/>
<l>When first I attempted your pity to move,</l>
<l>Why seem'd you so deaf to my prayers;</l>
<l>Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love,</l>
<l>But why did you kick me down stairs?</l>
<p>Were they not, Ma'am, very moving? oh dear—Come, Ma'am, he, looks penitent; give him your hand to kiss, and tell him you are friends with him.—Look you there, Sir, I knew it—There's nothing does with us, like a little coaxing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Your father, my dear <hi>Marcella,</hi> is determined to have our wedding a publick one; and Saturday next he assures me, shall be the happy day. Just as I left home, a good many of your things were brought, which I have ordered to be sent here, with some boxes of rich wine, and foreign sweetmeats, for the ball I intended to give a select number of our friends, to-morrow night. In the mean time, I'll step back to the old lodging, to see things properly taken care of.—<hi>Lazarillo,</hi> bring up those parcels.— And you, Mrs. <hi>Beatrice,</hi> will not find yourself forgotten.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>O then there's something for me! <hi>Lazarillo,</hi> make haste up with the things—I—suppose it's the new gown he promised to give me; and that your mantua-maker took measure of me for. I long to see it.—<hi>Lazarillo,</hi> I say, will you be all day?</p>

<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>I have something for every body—but that's your bundle, I believe— <stage>(slings down a parcel, which she immediately opens)</stage>—Here, comrades, set the table yonder, that I may put these things on it; quick, quick.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Dear Madam, look here; upon my life, it's very pretty: and every thing complete; a veil, and a petticoat, and lined all thro' with silk. I have a good mind to try it on now—Do you think it will become me, Ma'am?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, if your friends and family could be apprised of your situation, and design; but as the matter stands, Sir, I don't think we shall be able to make our escape by violence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>We can't pick our way through the walls then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>No, Sir, I think it much better picking here.—Suppose I take upon me a disguise, make my escape, inform your friends where you are, and have 'em ready—</p>

<p>What disguise?</p>
</sp>

<p>To tell you the truth, I am afraid to stay with Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> left, as valets are apt to ape their masters, I should be tempted to imitate him; and, as he had married your mistress, the devil might put it into my head to marry you.</p>

<p>Like enough.</p>

<p>Nay, some officers have, as I understand, been seen, within these two hours, walking backwards and forwards, before this house, and looking at it very inquisitively.</p>

<p>Here!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>How now! have you a mind to break the drums of my ears? What do you want, turbulence?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Lord, Sir, I'm surprized at you. How can you have the idea of making the best room in your house a bed-chamber.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Because I like it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, it will be shocking.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>What's that to you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Besides, I suppose Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> will remove to my lady's chamber in a night or two.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Ha, now you have got that in your head; and who bid you suppose about it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir, it's no business of mine, to be sure, if you have a mind to turn the house upside down;
<pb n="26" facs="25"/>only I love to set people right, and see things done properly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Well, but my nephew chose that room particularly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Why, so I told Mrs. <hi>Beatrice,</hi> Sir. I said, my master had made particular choice of that room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Very well then, let his bed be put in it; but remember, Sir, it's done by no order of mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>I believe there never was your fellow for impertinence, since the world begun. But why should I be surprized at this, when I am told, you give out all over the neighbourhood, that I am going to marry you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Ay, you may well laugh.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>I never gave out any such thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Don't lie, for I can prove it upon you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>I say then, Sir, I never did; for the thing was first mentioned to me: and, isn't it common enough, when a genteel likely girl lives in the house with a gentleman, for people to talk?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Well, I shan't dispute the matter with you, now. Go, take the coach, and fetch your young lady home, she's at her aunt's. Why don't you go where I bid you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>I'm settling myself, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! marry!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>What's the matter with you? I promise you I don't know whether I would take the old fellow, if he would have me; so he need not make himself uneasy.</p>

<p>I have the misfortune to be the wife of the most jealous, and suspicious of mankind, who is at the same time the most cruel. Upon a person's looking after me in the street, just now, he took something into his head, drew his poinard, and was going to strike me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>O for shame! What can I do for you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>I intreat you to go down into the street, and speak to him not to misuse me; you will easily know him, he is in a red cloak, and wears a gold laced hat, with a black feather.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>I'll go down madam. Step into that chamber; no body shall molest you. I warrant I'll give a good account of your jealous pate, and if words won't do, rougher means shall.</p>

<p>I was obliged to leave you here last night. It is too long a story to tell you now. Doubtful of what was become of you, and fearing the danger you might be in, I have prevailed upon the portress of the convent, where my brother had confined me, to let me out. Determined to make my way to you thro' all impediments. Here is a master-key to the house, which I happened to have providentially about me; take it, and let yourself out in the dead of night—for your own sake, for my reputation, I must leave you.—Farewell.</p>

<p>If I can see <hi>Beatrice,</hi> I think I may venture to tell her my story, and commit you to her care; 'tis the only thing I have for it; and the worst come to the worst, my mask and my sword shall defend me from every body else.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Heavens and earth, what do I hear! is not that <hi>Marcella's</hi> voice?—I am entangled so on every side, that it is impossible for me to extricate myself: must then the retreat I contrived for another, be my own destruction!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Where's my father?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>I don't know, Ma'am, but I've told him all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Told him! what have you told him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Why, about the woman, Ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>I'm sorry for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="36" facs="35"/>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Are you? I'm sorry too then, but you would not have had me tell him a lie, and he ask'd me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>In short, <hi>Beatrice,</hi> Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s behaviour has shaken my resolution—It betrays no marks of guilt; and, after all, if we should be mistaken—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Ma'am, if there is any raistake, you led me into it I'm sure; for I said at first, the woman was only a thief.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Go and desire my father to come to me here. I believe he is in Don <hi>Ferdinand's</hi> room.
<stage>(Marcella sits down in the chair which Aurora has just left).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Ma'am; but pray don't lay all the blame upon me. I never was used thus in any house in my life.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Don CARLOS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>I have ventured as far as my apprehensions would give me leave, but without being able to meet <hi>Beatrice;</hi> however, it is so far well, that I have met nobody else—Perhaps her weakness may now have left her
<stage>(approaching Marcella.)</stage> Dearest, tenderest creature, how is it with you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Ah!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>Confusion, what's this!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p><hi>Don Carlos.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>That wretch.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Whence come you, Sir? How got you here? Help,—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>Hold, Ma'am—where is the lady I left here just now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>What lady, what are you talking of? I saw no lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside.)</stage> Aurora then, has recovered, and gone back to our retreat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="37" facs="36"/>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>On reflection, I find myself in the most critical situation—My honour is at stake as well as your life. Only let me know in one word, why did you come here.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> BEATRICE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Your father and Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> are both gone—<stage>(<hi>Seeing</hi> Don <hi>Carlos.</hi>)</stage>—Ah, Madam! here is a man then, after all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>The man is Don <hi>Carlos</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>We shall be every one hang'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>How he got in, or his reason for coming, I cannot prevail on him to discover. For my part, I believe he is mad.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>His eyes look very ugly, I assure you; stand farther from him, Ma'am, he may have broken from his keepers—What do you want here, Sir? and which of our people let you in?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>None of your people let me in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>I suppose then you were the man Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> saw?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>I was.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>We must get him out, Ma'am, while your father and Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> are abroad; it will be better than calling the servants to take him, for reasons—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>But how shall we get him out?—He is subject to be seen by all the servants in the house, every one of whom know him—and at last, perhaps, he may be stopped by the centinels at the door.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>The centinels!—I never thought of them, —Lord! Lord! How shall we contrive!—One can't think of hanging the wretch.—Stay, there's a thought come into my head.—There is in my room, a military hat and cloak of your late
<pb n="38" facs="37"/>brother's; let him put on them; the centinels will take him for an officer—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Ay, <hi>Beatrice,</hi> let us carry him up into your chamber immediately.—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Follow that lady, Sir.
<stage>(Exit <hi>D.</hi> Car.)</stage> There's something that puzzles me in this business notwithstanding: for, I can hardly believe the man would come into this house, merely for the pleasure of being hang'd, let my lady say what she pleases.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>THE Duke of Medina, then, is entirely out of danger?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>His physicians have pronounced him so. I writ the Duke a candid account of our Rencounter. His Grace takes the blame of the whole affair upon himself, and assures me, upon his honour, he will not suffer me in any way to be troubled or molested about it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>It speaks the generosity which always ought to distinguish the nobleman. Hold, Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> stand back a little; do you see that fellow
<pb n="39" facs="38"/>that creeps yonder under the wall, looking behind him every moment?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>Ay, what of him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>He comes this way. Let us stand a little under that piazza, and observe him; I have my reasons for it.</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> MUSKATO.</stage>
<sp>
<p>What an infernal thing is a life of apprehension! I am out of the house, that's one comfort; and in some measure the way is paved for my master; for I have been among his friends, and fix of them, brave, young fellows like myself, will be ready to favour his escape; when our Dons are taking their digestive naps after dinner. I only wait their arrival, to give Don <hi>Carlos</hi> the signal from this little popper; <stage>(shews a pistol.)</stage> but I must first take a view of the house, in order to determine on which side I had best stand, when I give the alarm, that it may be sure to come to my master's ears. <stage>(Going off, suddenly starts.)</stage> Who do you want? It is not I! Lord have mercy on me, I thought some one had touched my shoulder. I'll shoot the first man that looks at me.</p>

<stage>(Exit Lazarillo.)</stage> The fellow's not at home, whom I sent to dog Don <hi>Carlos</hi> last night, or he could tell directly whether this is the same person that was with him.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, do you know him?</p>

<p>Why, Sir, I think I have seen his face before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Is he the servant of Don <hi>Carlos?</hi></p>
</sp>

<p>The very man.</p>

<p>Then let us go and seize him directly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>Hold, Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> you and your servant will be sufficient to deal with him, and it is absolutely necessary for me, to pay the compliment of calling at the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi>'s immediately; however, I'll be with you at your house in less than half an hour.</p>

<p>No, Sir! I'm not at all alarmed.</p>

<p>It is only a little commission I have to charge you with. In the first place, my dear girl, there is my purse, and ten thousand—</p>

<p>We are ready, Ma'am. Come, Sir, you must be cautious not to shew any confusion.—Come along the hall with a strut, and in passing by, look impudent, more impudent still; Oh, I shall never get you to look half impudent enough.</p>

<p>Upon my word, Sir, I can't say—perhaps I may, and perhaps I mayn't—you have frighten'd every thing quite out of my head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>He is his servant, Sir.</p>

<p>Well, Sir; yes, I am his servant, if that will content you.</p>

<p>Do you make a jest of us?</p>

<p>No, Sir, no; but I am ticklish, and your man has got his fingers in my collar: bid him take them away, and I'll speak.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Let him go—Well, now, Sir, where is Don <hi>Carlos?</hi></p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>What a clock!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir; because I would be as precise in answering your question, as possible: and, if it is now about half an hour after one, as I partly conjecture, Don <hi>Carlos</hi> is at this moment, picking his teeth, after dinner, in the city of Lisbon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>'Tis false, sirrah; I know he is at this moment hid somewhere in Madrid.—Lay hold of him again.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="44" facs="43"/>
<hi>Enter</hi> MARCELLA <hi>and</hi> BEATRICE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>What is the matter here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Only a couple of terrible fellows, Madam, that have got a poor criminal in their clutches, and are going to play the devil with him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>This is the servant of Don <hi>Carlos;</hi> I catched him just now in the street, measuring the outside of our house, with his eyes, from top to bottom.—I know his master is at present in Madrid; and I suspect, this emissary of his was not lurking about this neighbourhood for any good purpose:—rather, perhaps in meditation of some farther destruction of our family;—for, searching his pockets, we found a pistol.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>You found a pistol!—Do you say you found a pistol in my pocket?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>There it is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Oh, do you call that a pistol?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Ay, what do you call it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>I keep it to light my pipe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Well, but Sir, let me look at this person; because I was very well acquainted with Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> and his servant too, if this be the same he had before he left Madrid.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Do look at me, Ma'am, did you ever see my face before!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Never, upon my honour,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>See there gentlemen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Why you yourself said but now, that you belonged to Don <hi>Carlos.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Did I!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Yes, this moment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>I don't think I said any such thing: and I am almost sure I did not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir, you are mistaken here; he that lived with Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> used to make love to me;—a good, genteel, personable fellow:—
<pb n="45" facs="44"/>whereas this is one of the worst looking ill-made, aukward, ugly hounds, I ever saw in my life.—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Sir, believe what I say to you; this is the servant that lived with Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> when he was last in Madrid; and he was always just as ugly as he is now. I even recollect his name; it began with juss—or fuss—or—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>There is neither juss nor fuss in my name; so you may give me my liberty, and make no more fuss about the matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir; I think you had better turn him about his business.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>I think the contrary.—Pray, Ma'am, return to your chamber.
<stage>(<hi>Exit</hi> Marcella.)</stage> <hi>Lazarillo,</hi> lock that door, keep the key.—'Tis in vain to strive to escape, Sir; I shall lock you up here, till I come back with proper officers.—</p>

<p>'Tis a long story to tell:—however, make yourself easy; your master has escaped. He offered to stay with me, or make me the companion of his flight: the former, you may be sure, I would not hear of; and in the latter case, I know I should only be an impediment to him.</p>

<p>We have him here within; and he says he won't go without you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>I am very much obliged to him; but what good will that do me? However, at any rate, I should be glad to take my leave of him, before we part. Can't you put back the lock of the door.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>It's impossible; but comfort yourself; my lady, and I, have been both crying for you; and I dare swear we shall cry a great deal more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>You think we shall suffer then?</p>

<p>Certainly, I wish you well through it; take care of yourself.</p>

<p>You are greatly concerned about something.</p>

<p>I am, I confess, my dear Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> don't be surprized at what I am going to say to you: it stands me upon to keep this lady from my uncle's sight; I beg, therefore, you will not mention any thing about her: and pray, Ma'am, do you step into this cabinet.</p>

<p>I am sorry for that, Sir.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Here I am, Sir, what's your pleasure?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>What you won't let me enjoy ease, and quietness. They tell me, nephew, you have seized the servant of Don <hi>Carlos.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, but he has escaped.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>How has he escaped?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>That's more than I am able to say. I left him locked up here; and, when I came back again, I could not find him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Oh, very well; I warrant you I'll find him: I hear tales of a very ugly nature from one side and the other, of men, and women being concealed in the house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>'Tis most certain, Sir, that I met a strange man in the house last night; but I don't pretend to determine how he got in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>My daughter says there was a strange woman; and, for any thing that appears to the contrary, both the lurking toads may be in the house still; and, if somebody does not ferret them out, we may have our throats cut one of these nights, when we are asleep in our beds, and dreaming of no such matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, I can't think they are in the house still.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Oh! but I'll be sure; and, therefore, I am determined to hunt every hole and corner. And first, I'll begin to examine this room, perhaps they may have hid themselves—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Hold, Sir, you must not go in here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>No! And why not, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Do go in, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Nephew, I will go into that place.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, Sir, I have the greatest respect for you, but here my honour is engaged; and by Heaven, I will defend this door with my life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>This is very pretty behaviour, I protest; however, Sir, since you are so violent, I will not contend with you at present; I'll take this room in my way back: and will you, Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> be so obliging as to accompany me; while I search the rest of the apartments.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>You must not go this way, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Must not!—By my faith, but I will though.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>For shame, Sir, it looks as if you doubted my lady's honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>I say, Sir, do go in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, don't think of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Then I'll go in there.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, that must not be.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Yes, with a pack of mad people.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Laz.</speaker>
<p>Spirits, Sir, spirits—As I am a living man, your nephew, Don <hi>Alonzo,</hi> appeared to me this instant upon the stairs, in his regimental cloaths; I saw him as plain as I see you. His face was as long as my arm, and as pale as a piece of chalk; his eyes glared like two coals of fire, and he had a flambeau in his hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>I won't believe a word of this, it's all a monstrous lie—A ghost, and a piece of chalk, and a flambeau, and stuff; draw all your swords and follow me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Oh! hold! hold!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>

<sp>
<pb n="52" facs="51"/>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>No, come back. How have you the audaciousness, Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> to appear in this place? And what do you think must be the consequence of my seeing you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>I have delivered myself into your hands, Don <hi>Guzman,</hi> on the faith of your promise, that the memory of all past acts should be cancelled between us; but conscious of my innocence, I disdain to owe my safety to an undersigned clemency; recall what you have said, I release you from your word, if you can have more pleasure in satisfying an unjust revenge, than in sacrificing it to a point of honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Go away, and never let me see you more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>This may do for you, Don <hi>Guzman,</hi> but I am to be answered in another manner. The loss of a nephew may be forgiven, but not the ruin of a sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Car.</speaker>
<p>Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> I never wronged you, I esteem, I admire, I love your sister; and as a debt due to her reputation, brought into danger, by her inviting me to this house (where by a train of accidents I have been shut up against my will) before you all, I take her for my wife.</p>

<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>Brother—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Fer.</speaker>
<p>There is one circumstance, in this dark affair, which surprises me more than any thing else. Where is your servant, Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> whom I seized just now in the street? I left him locked up here, and in less than a quarter of an hour—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>

<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Pushing back the pannel)</stage> Are we all friends; is it peace, and good fellowship, without respect of persons?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Sirrah, I desire to know—</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="53" facs="52"/>

<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>I am included in the treaty, Sir.</p>
</sp>

<p>This brings things into my head. Hark, you rogue's face, was it not you that stole my gown?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Well, and where is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Why, you must know I put it on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<p>Put on my gown!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>Oh Lord, yes; I make one of the genteelest ladies you ever laid your eyes on; ask Don <hi>Guzman</hi> else. Being somewhat more corpulent than you, indeed, your gown has suffered a little in the seams; but don't make yourself uneasy; to recompence the damage, I throw myself and fortune at your feet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<p>This is the fact, as well as it can be related, in a few words.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Ped.</speaker>
<p>I do not doubt the truth of it. Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> you say you are willing to marry my sister; take her, and may you be happy together.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Guz.</speaker>
<p>Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> out of the great regard I have for you and yours, and for my own promise, I do forgive Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> and wish him happy with your sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Musk.</speaker>
<p>My dear master, I wish you joy, from the bottom of my heart, of being released from all your troubles, by the generosity of this good old gentleman: his behaviour has been that of a noble Spaniard; and I hope our friends will testify their satisfaction, by joining to applaud it.</p>
