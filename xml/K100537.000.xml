<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>THE Author of these poetical Attempts, begs Leave to say, that she should not have printed them, but that she is precluded from all Hopes of ever seeing the Tragedy brought upon the Stage, by there having been two so lately on the same Subject. If her's should be found to have any greater Resemblance to the two represented, than the Sameness of the Story made unavoidable, of which she is not conscious, it must have been accidental on her side, as there are many Persons, of very distinguished Rank, and unquestionable Veracity, who saw her's in Manuscript before the others appeared, and will witness for her, that she has taken no advantage of having seen them. She must here do Mr. <hi>Crisp</hi> the Justice to say, that any Resemblance must have been equally accidental on his part, as he neither did, nor could see her <hi>Virginia</hi> before his own was play'd;
<pb n="viii" facs="7"/>
Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> having declined reading her's, till Mr. <hi>Crisp's</hi> was published.</p>
<p>She is sensible of the Danger of appearing in Print, and of the many Imperfections in these Pieces; but hopes, her Sex, and the early Time of Li'e at which most of them were wrote, will plead her Excuse; she asks no more, than to be read with the fame Candor and Indulgence with which she herself reads the Productions of others.</p>
<p>One thing more she begs Leave to say, that she was greatly encouraged to this Publication, by the favorable Reception three Odes of her's met with, which were inserted in a weekly Paper called <hi>The Old Maid:</hi> as this Volume may possibly come into the Hands of Persons who are Strangers to the Paper, she has reprinted those Odes with the others.</p>
<p>And now, invoking the Powers for friendly Gales, she ventures to launch her little Bark into the wide Sea of Criticism, and Trembling quits the Shore.</p>

<stage>NUMITORIUS, VIRGINIA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>WEEP not, Virginia, all shall yet be well;</l>
<l>Now by my Sister's Shade, thy virtuous Mother,</l>
<l>I swear the Tyrant shall not force thee from us;</l>
<l>Why shou'dst thou fear his Power? the Monster dares not,</l>
<l>Howe'er he hop'd with Threats to move thy Soul,</l>
<l>Attempt to violate a free-born Virgin.</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="11"/>
But say, Virginia, did not Appius try</l>
<l>Each softer Method to seduce thy Virtue,</l>
<l>E'er his stern Fury rose to threaten Force?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VIRGINIA.</speaker>
<l>O Sir! with all the Blandishments of Vice</l>
<l>He first essay'd my Youth. With offer'd Power,</l>
<l>And Vows of tenderest Passion, he protested,</l>
<l>That did not his own Law forbid his Purpose,</l>
<l>He wou'd divorce the Partner of his Bed,</l>
<l>And place me there.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>His Law! The Gods are just,</l>
<l>And on himself retort his Insolence;</l>
<l>Yes, let him sigh for a Plebeian Maid,</l>
<l>And sigh in vain: by Heaven 'tis righteous Vengeance.</l>
<l>But does he talk of Laws? He, who has broke</l>
<l>Through every sacred Bond? Who, on Pretence,</l>
<l>Of framing Laws, has bid them all Defiance,</l>
<l>And owns no Obligation but his Will?</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="12"/>
Is this our Legislator? But proceed:</l>
<l>Tell me, Virginia, did he dare to offer</l>
<l>Terms of Disgrace and Shame?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VIRGINIA.</speaker>
<l>O Numitorius!</l>
<l>Spare my Confusion—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>I trust, Virginia, you receiv'd his Love</l>
<l>With all the Pride of Virtue, all the Scorn,</l>
<l>And strong Resentment, of a Roman Maid</l>
<l>Who loves her Honour and her Liberty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VIRGINIA.</speaker>
<l>Yes, fired with generous Rage, and fierce Disdain,</l>
<l>I told him, were he free, his Law repeal'd,</l>
<l>Himself the Son of Jove, I wou'd reject</l>
<l>His lawful Vows, and think the brave Icilius</l>
<l>Superior to the Tyrant of his Country.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>How bore he this?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="13"/>
<speaker>VIRGINIA.</speaker>
<l>He stood a Moment speechless,</l>
<l>Then, his Eyes flaming, wild with mad Revenge,</l>
<l>And disappointed Love, 'Tis well, he cry'd,</l>
<l>My Power may reach you yet, remember, Maid,</l>
<l>You have not now your Tribunes to protect you;</l>
<l>Appius is Lord of Rome: then sudden turn'd,</l>
<l>And left me dead with Terror, for too well</l>
<l>I know his Power, and tremble for my Honor.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>Why was this base Attempt at first conceal'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VIRGINIA.</speaker>
<l>Alas! I fear'd Icilius' Warmth of Temper;</l>
<l>I knew his Love, and his impatient Spirit,</l>
<l>And hop'd my Scorn wou'd cure the Tyrant's Passion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>Fear not, Virginia, soon our Roman Legions</l>
<l>Shall drive these rash Invaderst rembling back;</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="14"/>
And crown'd with Laurel, midst his Fellow Soldiers,</l>
<l>Thy Father shall return to join thy Hand</l>
<l>With young Icilius, and secure thy Virtue:</l>
<l>The holy Marriage Bed the wildest Nations,</l>
<l>E'en savage Gauls, regard with sacred Awe.</l>
<l>But I too long detain thee, 'tis the Hour</l>
<l>In which thy gentle Friend, the fair Icilia,</l>
<l>Expects thy Presence.—Ha! Trebonius here!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>WELCOME, my dear Trebonius, from the Camp:</l>
<l>How fares my valiant Brother?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="15"/>
<speaker>TREBONIUS.</speaker>
<l>Well, my Friend;</l>
<l>If Romans can be well when Slaves to Tyrants.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>What brings you here?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TREBONIUS.</speaker>
<l>Obedience to my Leader,</l>
<l>And Shame to see the Roman Legions fly:</l>
<l>Cornelius sends by me for fresh Supplies</l>
<l>To stop the conquering Equan Troops: Tomorrow</l>
<l>May bring them to these Walls. O, Numitorius!</l>
<l>These Eyes have seen the bravest Sons of Rome</l>
<l>Driven to their very Camp, like fearful Fawns,</l>
<l>By these oft beaten Equi, by the Foes</l>
<l>They once disdain'd, nor cou'd my Soul condemn them:</l>
<l>Why shou'd they spend their dearest Blood for Appius?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="16"/>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>For him indeed, for to his tow'ring Genius</l>
<l>His Brother Tyrants bend; they wait his Nod,</l>
<l>And take the Word from him; at his Command</l>
<l>They steep their impious Hands in Blood, or load</l>
<l>With slavish Chains their freeborn Countrymen.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TREBONIUS.</speaker>
<l>Each Hour brings fresh Disgrace; our conquering Army,</l>
<l>Which pour'd the Tide of Victory along,</l>
<l>And like a Torrent overflow'd the Nations,</l>
<l>Now ebbs, retiring, at the slightest Breath</l>
<l>Of Opposition.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>Gods! shall Romans fly,</l>
<l>And from the timorous Equi? Shall the Stag,</l>
<l>The trembling Stag, pursue the lordly Lyon?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="17"/>
<speaker>TREBONIUS.</speaker>
<l>O, Rome! imperial Rome! How art thou fallen!</l>
<l>Behold! the Roman Eagle, which e'erwhile</l>
<l>Soar'd with strong Pinion o'er the wondring World,</l>
<l>Now spiritless, unnerv'd, with drooping Wing</l>
<l>Sits languid, all its daring Flights forgot,</l>
<l>Crush'd by th'oppressive Hand of Tyranny!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>Yes, we are fallen indeed! O, my Trebonius!</l>
<l>I blush to tell thee, but this Monster Appius</l>
<l>With brutal Love has dar'd t'insult Virginia,</l>
<l>Pledg'd as she is to brave Icilius.—</l>

<l>NUMITORIUS,</l>
<l>This Moment as Virginia past the Forum,</l>
<l>To visit fair Icilia, she was seiz'd</l>
<l>By Claudius, Appius' most abandon'd Freedman,</l>
<l>Who call'd her Slave, and rudely dragg'd her off</l>
<l>To the Tribunal of his Lord. I hasted</l>
<l>To tell you this, nor know I more that past.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>To his Tribunal? Gods! what can it mean?</l>
<l>The Tyrant cannot dare—O, Soldier! Friend!</l>
<l>Wilt thou assist us? Think of brave Virginius;</l>
<l>Is't fit his Daughter?—But I know thy Virtue.</l>

<l>O, gracious Appius!</l>
<l>To whom the Injur'd never kneel in vain,</l>
<l>To you I bend for Justice: this bright Maid,</l>
<l>Who long has past for old Virginius' Daughter,</l>
<l>Is Daughter of my Slave, born in my House,</l>
<l>And thence by Fraud convey'd to Numitoria,</l>
<l>Who bred her as her own Virginius absent.</l>
<l>To hide th' approbrious Curse of Barrenness:</l>
<l>This in the Hour of Sickness was confess'd,</l>
<l>With penitential Sighs and Tears, by her</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="20"/>
Who gave her Birth; I therefore seiz'd upon her,</l>
<l>Nor will resign her but to brave Virginius,</l>
<l>If he disprove my Claim: since he is absent,</l>
<l>From you, the Friend of Justice, I demand,</l>
<l>That she remain with me till his Return.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>APPIUS.</speaker>
<l>'Tis just, nor can I stop the Course of Law:</l>
<l>Lictors, make Way, and let the legal Claimant</l>
<l>Lead off th' unhappy Virgin. See Virginius</l>

<l>Deserves it, but let Chastity be safe.</l>
<l>O Romans! by the sacred Name of Father,</l>

<l>The giddy Height</l>
<l>To which mistaken Rome has rais'd them, turns</l>
<l>Their maddening Brains, or Appius would behold</l>
<l>His sure Destruction in this wild Attempt.</l>
<l>The Gods are just, and tho' unseen to Men,</l>

<l>I yet have Hope, Trebonius; had he dar'd</l>

<l>This poor Device, this Tale of fancy'd Slavery,</l>

Virginius' Presence yet will save his Child:</l>
<l>By Morning's earliest Dawn he will be here;</l>

<l>His coward Fears, I hope, are ominous:</l>
<l>By brave, plebeian, honest Deeds, Virginius</l>
<l>Has gain'd the Soldiers' Love; nor will they see,</l>
<l>Howe'er their Spirits droop, a Vet'ran wrong'd:</l>
<l>I left them ripe for every noble Purpose;</l>
<l>Long these Decemvirs have been hateful to them;</l>
<l>To this alone is owing our Defeats;</l>

<l>O, my Virginia!—But I cannot speak—</l>
<l>Resentment, Rage, and Indignation, rise,</l>

<l>By awful Heaven, when Rome was free and glorious,</l>
<l>E'er these Decemvirs fix'd their lawless Yoke,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ICILIA.</speaker>
<l>O, no, Virginia; all the dear Delights</l>
<l>Of growing Friendship rush on my Remembrance:</l>
<l>When dawning Reason first began to shoot,</l>
<l>Each early Hope confect this pleasing End:</l>
<l>My Bosom panted for a Counterpart,</l>
<l>Some Fellow Mind, to soften every Pang,</l>
<l>And double Joy by sweet Participation:</l>
<l>Amongst the soft Companions of my Youth</l>
<l>I sought a Friend: Virginia, dear Virginia,</l>
<l>Possess'd alone, of all our Roman Maids,</l>
<l>A Soul susceptive of the social Glow:</l>
<l>Dull was each Sport, each Pastime lost its Taste,</l>
<l>If e'er I mist Virginia from the Train,</l>

</sp>

<speaker>VIRGINIA.</speaker>
<l>Yes, our first Days were happy: smiling Youth</l>
<l>Came on attended by surrounding Pleasures:</l>
<l>But Joy to me has been a Prodigal,</l>
<l>Who with too lavish Hand dispenc'd her Bounties,</l>
<l>And left my riper Days a Prey to Sorrow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ICILIA.</speaker>
<l>Cast back thy Thoughts a Moment, my Virginia,</l>
<l>To those calm Joys which blest our heedless Youth:</l>
<l>How have we sat beneath embow'ring Shades,</l>
<l>Whilst the clear Stream in Silence glided by,</l>
<l>And lost in sweet romantic Pleasure, chid</l>
<l>The dancing Hours that fled too fast away!</l>
<l>All then was Peace and Harmony.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VIRGINIA.</speaker>
<l>No more:</l>
<l>Forbear to wake these tender Images:</l>
<l>Remembrance pains me; I must now forget</l>
<l>All vanish'd Happiness, and fill my Soul</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ICILIA.</speaker>
<l>No, my Virginia, nor will Appius dare</l>
<l>To sentence thee a Slave: e'en midst his Guard</l>
<l>Of riotous, patrician Youth, he trembles,</l>
<l>And fears the Soldiers Vengeance: well he knows</l>
<l>The Rank Virginius holds in their Affections.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VIRGINIA.</speaker>

<l>The Looks of mingled Passion and Revenge,</l>

<l>No, 'tis Ambition fires them, they wou'd raise</l>

<l>Those matchless Charms, which, like the Grecian Helens,</l>

<l>You still mistake me; still is your Virginia</l>

<l>A Moment's Patience, and I will unfold</l>
<l>A Tale shall rouse each Drop of Roman Blood,</l>

<l>The fierce Decemvir has with Eyes of Love</l>
<l>Beheld your beauteous Daughter, and since all</l>
<l>His Arts of Vice have fail'd to move her Virtue,</l>
<l>Has urg'd his base, abandon'd Freedman, Claudius,</l>

<l>In Claudius' Family: with slow Reluctance,</l>
<l>Aw'd by the murmuring People, he consented</l>
<l>That till this Morn' his Sentence shou'd be stay'd;</l>
<l>Even on the Instant I dispatch'd Fabatus</l>
<l>To bring you from the Camp, but lest your Rage</l>
<l>Shou'd force the Story from you, I enjoin'd him,</l>

<l>ENOUGH, my Friends, Icilius is your Tribune:</l>
<l>Where is Virginius? Liberty is ours:</l>
<l>The Tyrant falls; the People, all inspir'd</l>
<l><pb n="125" facs="136"/>
With sudden Rage, have burst th'enfeebling Bands</l>

<speaker>ICILIUS.</speaker>
<l>Let us fly:</l>
<l>Virginia's injured Spirit hovers o'er us,</l>
<l>And calls for ampler Vengeance: yes, thou dear one,</l>
<l>The whole accurst Decemvirate shall bleed,</l>
<l>Thy offer'd Victims.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NUMITORIUS.</speaker>
<l>Mid'st the rising Tumult;</l>
<l>A Messenger is seiz'd, who bears to Fabius</l>
<l>The Tyrant's Orders to behead brave Labeo,</l>
<l>And decimate the Troops: this seals them ours,</l>

<l>Droop not, Virginius; let Revenge awake you;</l>
<l>Revenge, and Liberty: 'tis Rome that calls.</l>

<l>Yes, brave Trebonius, I obey thy Summons:</l>
<l>Sunk as I am beneath this Weight of Sorrow,</l>
<l>My bleeding Country shall not call in vain:</l>
<l>I will forget the Father, in the Roman.</l>

This second Lucrece, saves her suffering Country.</l>
<l>The Ways of Heaven are hid from human Sight,</l>
<l>Unsearchable to Man: tho' Justice lingers,</l>
<l>'Tis but with Rage redoubled to return,</l>
<l>And crush the Tyrant who securely sins,</l>
<l>Nor deems that Jove beholds his dark Offences.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>TREBONIUS.</speaker>
<l>From this Event, let erring Mortals know,</l>
<l>Jove marks their Crimes, tho' he withholds the Blow:</l>
<l>Black Vengeance rises at his dread Command,</l>
<l>Nor sleeps the Thunder in th' Almighty's Hand.</l>
<l>O, King of Gods! still guard the Roman State!</l>
<l>Let Death unpity'd on Ambition wait,</l>
