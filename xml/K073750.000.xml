<epigraph>
<l>Non perch' io creda bisognar miei carmi</l>
<l>A chi se ne fa copia da se stessa;</l>
<l>Ma sol per satisfare a questo mio</l>
<l>Che he d'onorarta e di lodar disio.</l>
<bibl>ARIOSTO, Canto xxxvii.</bibl>
</epigraph>
<l>THE Great and Fair, in ev'ry age and clime,</l>
<l>Receive free homage from the Sons of Rhyme:</l>
<l>Bend, ye ambitious Bards, at Grandeur's shrine!</l>
<l>Be Power your patron! Wit and Beauty mine!—</l>
<l>To thee, whom elegance has taught to please</l>
<l>By serious dignity, or sportive case;</l>
<l>Whom Virtue hails, at Pleasure's festive rites,</l>
<l>Chaste Arbiter of Art's refin'd delights:</l>
<l>To thee, fair DEVON! I breathe this votive strain;</l>
<l>Nor dread th' averted ear of proud Disdain:</l>
<l>For O, if music has not blest my lyre,</l>
<l>A lovelier spirit of th' aetherial choir,</l>
<l>Joy-breathing Gratitude, that hallow'd guest,</l>
<l>Who fires with heavenly zeal the human breast,</l>
<l><pb n="iv" facs="3"/>Bids my weak voice her swelling note prolong,</l>
<l>And consecrate to thee her tributary song.</l>
<l>When first my anxious Muse's fav'rite child,</l>
<l>Her young SERENA, artless, simple, wild,</l>
<l>Presum'd from privacy's safe scenes to fly,</l>
<l>And met in giddy haste the public eye;</l>
<l>Thy generous praise her trembling youth sustain'd,</l>
<l>The smile she dar'd not ask, from thee she gain'd;</l>
<l>And found a guardian in the gracious DEVON,</l>
<l>Kind as the regent of her fancied heaven.—</l>
<l>The flatter'd Muse, whose offspring thou hast blest,</l>
<l>In the fond pride that rules a parent's breast,</l>
<l>Presents thus boldly to thy kind embrace</l>
<l>This little group of her succeeding race,</l>
<l>Blest! if by pathos true to Nature's law,</l>
<l>From thy soft bosom they may haply draw</l>
<l>Those tender sighs, that eloquently shew</l>
<l>The virtues of the heart from whence they flow!</l>
<l>Blest! if by foibles humorously hit</l>
<l>In the light scenes that aim at comic wit,</l>
<l>They turn thy pensive charms to mirthful grace,</l>
<l>And wake the sprightly sweetness of thy face!</l>
<l>While thus the proud Enthusiast would aspire</l>
<l>To change thy beauties with her changing lyre;</l>
<l>Much as she wants the talent and the right,</l>
<l>To shew thy various charms in varied light,</l>
<l>O might the Muse, intruding on thy bower,</l>
<l>From her fair Patron catch the magic power!</l>
<l>Frequent to meet the public eye, and still</l>
<l>That fickle eye with fond amazement fill!</l>
<l>Let her, if this vain wish is lost in air,</l>
<l>Breathe from her grateful heart a happier prayer!</l>
<l><pb n="v" facs="4"/>Howe'er her different sables may give birth</l>
<l>To fancied woe, and visionary mirth;</l>
<l>May all thy griefs belong to Fiction's reign,</l>
<l>And wound thee only with a pleasing pain!</l>
<l>May thy light spirit, on the sea of life,</l>
<l>Elude the rocks of care, the gusts of strife,</l>
<l>And safely, as the never-sinking buoy,</l>
<l>Float on th' unebbing flood of real joy!</l>

<div2 n="1" type="act">
<head>ACT THE FIRST. SCENE I.</head>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Sir Nicholas, <hi>in debate with</hi> Mrs. Felix <hi>and</hi> Selina.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>WHAT a strange declaration!—it gives me the spleen;</l>
<l>But 'tis what good Sir Nicholas never can mean.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>Not mean it, fair lady!—By Jupiter, yes!</l>
<l>And my project, you'll see, will be crown'd with success;</l>
<l>I am joyous myself, and 'tis ever my plan</l>
<l>To give those I love all the joy that I can.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>We own it—but joy is like diet, dear cousin,</l>
<l>One palate mayn't relish what pleases a dozen;</l>
<l>Nor will I allow that my appetite's vicious,</l>
<l>If, perchance, I don't like what you think most delicious.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="7"/>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>Rare dainty distinctions!—But can I believe</l>
<l>That a woman e'er liv'd, since the wedding of Eve,</l>
<l>Whose heart (tho' most coyly her head might be carried)</l>
<l>Did not fervently wish to be speedily married?</l>
<l>Not to wound your nice ears with the name of desires</l>
<l>Which youth renders lovely, and nature inspires,</l>
<l>Your sex, from its weakness demands a defender,</l>
<l>Whom pride and affection make watchful and tender;</l>
<l>And if my fair Coz is no hypocrite grown,</l>
<l>The truth of my maxims you'll honestly own;</l>
<l>While the wars from your arms the brave Colonel detain,</l>
<l>Is the want of a husband the source of no pain?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>There, indeed, you have touch'd me a little too near,</l>
<l>My Soldier, you know, to my soul is most dear,</l>
<l>I own—and my frankness you never will blame,</l>
<l>I'd purchase his presence with ought but his fame.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>Well said, thou dear, honest, and warm-hearted wife;</l>
<l>For thy truth may good angels still watch o'er his life!</l>
<l>And while others the rough field of slaughter are treading,</l>
<l>Send him home full of glory, to dance at our wedding!</l>
<l>For a wedding we'll have to enliven us all,</l>
<l>And Hymen's bright altar shall warm the old hall.</l>
<l>For my Niece ere I die 'tis my wish to provide,</l>
<l>And ere two months are past I <hi>will</hi> see her a bride.</l>
<l>I'm resolv'd—and you know that my neighbours all say,</l>
<l>Sir Nicholas Oddfish will have his own way.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Selina, dear Sir, wants no other protection,</l>
<l>While her life glides in peace by your gentle direction.</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="8"/>She thinks, and, I own, I approve her remark:</l>
<l>In conjugal cares 'tis too soon to embark:</l>
<l>Her bosom untouch'd by Love's dangerous dart,</l>
<l>Fate has not yet shewn her the man of her heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>The man of her heart!—these nonsensical fancies</l>
<l>You light-headed females pick out of romances.</l>
<l>That I am no tyrant you know very well,</l>
<l>So Cousin don't teach my good Niece to rebel!</l>
<l>I am no greedy guardian, who thinks it his duty</l>
<l>On the altar of Plutus to sacrifice beauty;</l>
<l>Whose venal barbarity, justly abhorr'd,</l>
<l>Ties a lovely young girl to an old crippled lord,</l>
<l>And basely, to gain either rank or estate,</l>
<l>Makes her swear she will love, what she cannot but hate.</l>
<l>From such a protector Heaven guard my dear Niece!</l>
<l>I wish her to wed that her joys may increase;</l>
<l>And the deuce must be in the strange girl who discovers</l>
<l>No man to her mind in such plenty of lovers.</l>
<l>To no very great length will my cruelty run,</l>
<l>If from twenty admirers I bid her chuse one.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>But why, dear Sir Nicholas, why in such haste?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>'Tis thus that my projects are ever disgrac'd</l>
<l>With the false names of hurry and precipitation,</l>
<l>Because I abhor silly procrastination;</l>
<l>That thief of delight, who deludes all our senses,</l>
<l>Who cheats us for ever with idle pretences,</l>
<l>By whom, like the dog in the fable, betray'd,</l>
<l>We let go the substance to snap at the shade.</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="9"/>To seize present Time is the true Art of Life;</l>
<l>'Tis Time who now cries, make Selina a Wife!</l>
<l>The season is come, I've so long wish'd to see,</l>
<l>From the moment I dandled her first on my knee:</l>
<l>She, you know, to my care was bequeath'd by my Brother,</l>
<l>And having this Child, I ne'er wish'd for another:</l>
<l>Thro' life I have kept myself single for her;</l>
<l>Her interest, her joy, to my own I prefer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>Your kindness, dear Sir, I can never repay.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>In truth, my dear damsel, you easily may;</l>
<l>I demand no return so enormously great;</l>
<l>I ask but a Boy to possess my estate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>Lord, Uncle, how come such odd thoughts in your head?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>From his heart, I assure you—'tis pleasantly said;</l>
<l>A fair stipulation—both parties agreed,</l>
<l>The compact, I trust, in due time will succeed;</l>
<l>But patience, dear Knight, you will have your desire,</l>
<l>Nor wait very long for a young little 'Squire.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>The cold stream of Patience ne'er creeps in my veins,</l>
<l>But the wish my heart forms my quick spirit attains.</l>
<l>I'm none of your chill atmospherical wretches,</l>
<l>Whose affections are subject to starts and to catches;</l>
<l>Whose wish, like a weather-cock, veering about,</l>
<l>Now turns towards hope, and now changes to doubt:</l>
<l>No, mine, like the needle without variation,</l>
<l>Only looks to one point, and that point's Consummation.</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="10"/>I want to behold this young Urchin arise,</l>
<l>Before I have lost or my legs or my eyes,</l>
<l>That I may enjoy all his little vagaries,</l>
<l>As the changeable season of infancy varies.</l>
<l>I long to be moulding his heart and his spirit,</l>
<l>To shew him the fields he is born to inherit;</l>
<l>Lead him round our rich woods, while my limbs are yet limber,</l>
<l>And tell the young rogue, how I've nurs'd up his timber;</l>
<l>That when the worn thread of my life is untwisted,</l>
<l>He long may remember that I have existed:</l>
<l>And when my old frame in our monument rests,</l>
<l>As he walks by my grave with a few worthy guests,</l>
<l>He thus to some warm-hearted friend may address him,</l>
<l>Here lies my odd, honest, old Uncle—God bless him!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Thank Heaven, dear Cousin, your hale constitution</l>
<l>Shews not the least sign of a near dissolution.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>To make your life happy, whate'er the condition,</l>
<l>Has been, my dear Uncle, my highest ambition;</l>
<l>To fulfil every wish that your fancy can frame,</l>
<l>Still is, as it ought to be, ever my aim:</l>
<l>But if by your voice I am doom'd to the altar,</l>
<l>With terror and pain my weak accents must falter,</l>
<l>Unless my kind stars a new lover should send me,</l>
<l>Unlike all the swains who now deign to attend me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>Nice wench! do you want the whole world to adore you?</l>
<l>Would you have all the men of the earth rang'd before you?</l>
<l>For, thanks to your charms, and to fortune's kind bounty,</l>
<l>You may rank in your train all the youth of our county,</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="11"/>And chuse whom you will; if the man has but worth,</l>
<l>And is nearly your equal in wealth and in birth,</l>
<l>I give my consent—you are free from restriction;</l>
<l>But I will not be plagu'd with perverse contradiction.</l>
<l>I will see you wed without any delay:</l>
<l>Your two fittest lovers are coming to-day;</l>
<l>Young Sapphic, whose verses delight all the fair,</l>
<l>And Dicky Decisive, Sir Jacob's next heir:</l>
<l>Both young and both wealthy, both comely and clever,</l>
<l>To gain you, no doubt, each will warmly endeavour;</l>
<l>For they come for a month, by my own invitation,</l>
<l>On purpose to found my dear girl's inclination:</l>
<l>I have said to them both, and no man can speak fairer,</l>
<l>Let him, who can please her most, win her and wear her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA,</speaker>
<stage><hi>aside to</hi> Mrs. Felix.</stage>
<l>Good angels defend me!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>I see nothing frightful:</l>
<l>Our month with such guests must be very delightful:</l>
<l>When Sapphic's soft verses incline us to dose,</l>
<l>Dick will keep us awake with satirical prose.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>Don't cross me, I say! nor mislead my good Niece!</l>
<l>By Jove, if she thwarts me with any caprice,</l>
<l>Like a certain old justice I'll ring up my maids,</l>
<l>And marry the first of the frank-hearted jades;</l>
<l>For perverse contradiction I never will bear,</l>
<l>But provide for myself a more dutiful heir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Dear Cousin, in spite of his worship's decision,</l>
<l>You cannot be certain of such a provision:</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="12"/>Attempts of that nature are subject to fail.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>My designs you shall see, Madam, always prevail:</l>
<l>For if this nice Gipsy, by your machination,</l>
<l>Declines every offer, to give me vexation,</l>
<l>Like my late jolly neighbour, Sir Timothy Trickum,</l>
<l>Who vindictively married the frail Molly Quickum,</l>
<l>I'll make sure of the matter, and chuse me a wife,</l>
<l>With an heir ready plac'd on the threshold of life:</l>
<l>For, as I have said, tho' a foe to restriction,</l>
<l>I never will suffer perverse contradiction.</l>
<l>You now know my mind, which no mask ever covers,</l>
<l>So farewell, and prepare to receive your two lovers.
<stage>Exit.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Go thy way, thou strange mixture of sense and of blindness!</l>
<l>A model at once of oppression and kindness.</l>
<l>Thy will, thou odd compound of goodness and whim,</l>
<l>Is a stream, against which it is treason to swim;</l>
<l>Yet we must cross the current—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>Dear Cousin say how!</l>
<l>Direct opposition he will not allow:</l>
<l>What can you devise as a plan of prevention?</l>
<l>How divert his keen spirit from this new intention?</l>
<l>I had much rather die than be ever united</l>
<l>To one of the lovers, that he has invited:</l>
<l>My heart has a thorough aversion to both:</l>
<l>Yet to make him unhappy I'm equally loth;</l>
<l>When I think what I owe to his tender protection,</l>
<l>The worst of all ills is to lose his affection.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Dear Girl, your warm gratitude gives you new charms:</l>
<l>'Tis an amiable fear, which your bosom alarms,</l>
<l>And I from your Uncle's quick humour would screen you,</l>
<l>Nor loosen the bands of affection between you.</l>
<l>He merits your love, and you know he has mine;</l>
<l>Yet we somehow must baffle his hasty design,</l>
<l>Nor suffer his whim thus to make you a Wife,</l>
<l>To repent the rash business the rest of his life.</l>
<l>Take courage! kind Chance may assist us—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>I doubt it,</l>
<l>Yet Heaven knows how we shall manage without it;</l>
<l>For when his heart's set on a favorite scheme,</l>
<l>His ardor and haste, as you know, are extreme,</l>
<l>Like a med'cine ill-tim'd opposition is vain,</l>
<l>And inflames the disorder 'twas meant to restrain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>In his fevers indeed there is no intermission:</l>
<l>And thanks, gentle Coz! to your soft disposition!</l>
<l>So sweet and compliant your temper has been,</l>
<l>You have taught him to think contradiction a sin;</l>
<l>And here all around him confirm that belief,</l>
<l>His vassals all bow to the nod of their chief.</l>
<l>Here shut from the world in this rural dominion,</l>
<l>No mortal opposes his will or opinion;</l>
<l>And thus he is spoil'd—Politicians all say,</l>
<l>Human nature's not fashion'd for absolute sway.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>'Tis true, tho' the world, as you say, think him odd,</l>
<l>In this sphere he is held a diminutive god:</l>
<l><pb n="15" facs="14"/>And when I behold how his fortune is spent,</l>
<l>In suppressing vexation, and spreading content;</l>
<l>When I hear all the poor his kind bounty expressing,</l>
<l>And thoroughly know how he merits their blessing,</l>
<l>My feelings with theirs in his eulogy join,</l>
<l>And confess, that his nature is truly divine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Thou excellent Girl! if such fondness and zeal</l>
<l>For a warm-hearted, whimsical Uncle you feel,</l>
<l>With what fine sensations your bosom will glow,</l>
<l>What tender attachment your temper will shew,</l>
<l>When your fortunate lord Love and Hymen invest</l>
<l>With higher dominion o'er that gentle breast!</l>
<l>But tell me, dear Cousin—be honest—declare,</l>
<l>Has no young secret swain form'd an interest there?</l>
<l>I suspect—but don't let my suspicion affright you,</l>
<l>Tho' the good Knight's rare virtues amuse and delight you,</l>
<l>From this gloomy old hall you would wish to get free,</l>
<l>Had not Cupid preserv'd you from feeling <hi>ennui</hi>;</l>
<l>Come, tell me the name of the favorite youth:</l>
<l>I am sure I guess right.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>No, in sad sober truth</l>
<l>I never have seen in the course of my life,</l>
<l>A mortal to whom I should chuse to be wise.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Ye stars, what a pity!—I wish I could learn</l>
<l>That my Colonel from India would shortly return,</l>
<l>Both for your sake and mine; for our present distress</l>
<l>He would speedily turn into joyous success;</l>
<l>As his regiment must some young hero afford,</l>
<l>Who might throw at your feet both himself and his sword.</l>
<l>What say you, my dear, to a soldier?—</l>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="16" facs="15"/><hi>Enter</hi> Jenny.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
<l>Oh! Madam,</l>
<l>Here's young Mr. Sapphic—I vow, if I had them,</l>
<l>I'd give fifty pounds had you seen how politely</l>
<l>He beg'd me to tie a sweet nosegay up tightly,</l>
<l>Which is jolted to pieces—well, he's a sweet beau;</l>
<l>And now with his pencil he's writing below,</l>
<l>I believe 'tis a posy, he writes it so neatly,</l>
<l>And I'm sure 'tis fine verse, Ma'am, it sounded so sweetly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Oh charming! his vows will be very sublime,</l>
<l>And I trust we shall hear his proposals in rhyme.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>How can you, dear Cousin, so cruelly jest in</l>
<l>A business you know I am really distrest in?</l>
<l>I shall certainly forfeit my Uncle's protection,</l>
<l>For I never can wed where I feel no affection.</l>
<l>Do help me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>

<l>O, Ma'am, Mr. Sapphic is coming up stairs.</l>
<stage>(Aside as she goes out.)</stage>
<l>I am mightily pleas'd with this marrying plan,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>Fair Ladies, the moments have seem'd to be hours,</l>
<l>While I stopt in your hall to adjust a few flowers:</l>
<l><pb n="17" facs="16"/>For the season, I'm told, they're uncommonly fine;</l>
<l>But I still wish the tribute more worthy the shrine.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Bowing and presenting them to</hi> Selina.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>Mr. Sapphic is always extremely polite:</l>
<l>These roses, indeed, are a wonderful sight;</l>
<l>You are far better florists than we are.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>My dear,</l>
<l>Mr. Sapphic has magic to make them appear,</l>
<l>And Flora is brib'd by the songs he composes</l>
<l>To produce for her poet extempore roses;</l>
<l>Into this early bloom all her plants are bewitch'd:</l>
<l>But you do not observe how the gift is inrich'd,</l>
<l>Here's a border of verse, if my eyes don't deceive me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA,</speaker>
<stage><hi>aside to</hi> Mrs. Felix.</stage>
<l>Dear Cousin you'll read it—I pray you relieve me;</l>
<l>I shall blush like a fool at each civil expression.</l>
</sp>

<l>Now with emphasis just and with proper discretion.</l>
<stage>(Mrs. Felix <hi>reads.</hi>)</stage>
<l>"Ye happy flowers give and receive perfume</l>
<l>"As on Selina's fragrant breast ye bloom:</l>
<l>"From earth, tho' not arrang'd in order nice,</l>
<l>"Ye are transplanted into Paradise;</l>
<l>"If on that spot ye languish into death,</l>
<l>"'Twill be from envy of her sweeter breath."</l>
<l>'Tis a delicate compliment, tender and pretty,</l>
<l>What original spirit! how graceful and witty!</l>

<sp>
<pb n="18" facs="17"/>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>Dear Ma'am, you're too good to find any thing in it,</l>
<l>'Tis a mere hasty trifle—the work of a minute:</l>
<l>On the anvil had not a moment to hammer,</l>
<l>And I fear, in my haste I have sinn'd against grammar.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>All slight imperfections I never regard</l>
<l>When I meet with such vigor of thought in a bard,</l>
<l>With a fancy so brilliant—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>O! Ma'am, you're too kind;</l>
<l>But candor's the test of an amiable mind.</l>
<l>I wish that your taste all our Critics might guide,</l>
<l>To soften that rigor with which they decide.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>From Critics, dear Sir, you have litttle to fear.</l>
<l>If Mr. Decisive himself had been here,</l>
<l>He must have been charm'd with this sweet <hi>jeu d'esprit,</hi></l>
<l>Which, as he is coming to-day, he shall see.</l>
<l>I am eager to hear how his wit will applaud it:</l>
<l>To conceal it would be of due praise to defraud it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>In Mercy's name, Ladies, I beg your protection,</l>
<l>Preserve my poor rhymes from Decisive's inspection;</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Say rather how sprightly—</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Dear Sir, he's your friend,</l>
<l>And I thought he had seen all the poems you pen'd:</l>
<l>I was told that to him your long works you rehearse—</l>
<l>Does Mr. Decisive himself write in verse?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>I wish from my soul that he did now and then;</l>
<l>But he uses the pen-knife much more than the pen,</l>
<l>And too freely has slash'd all who write in the nation,</l>
<l>To give them an opening for retaliation.</l>
<l>My old friend Decisive has honour and wit;</l>
<l>To the latter, indeed, he makes most things submit;</l>
<l>And thinks it fair sport, as a friend or a foe,</l>
<l>To knock down a Bard by a flaming <hi>bon mot.</hi></l>
<l>To your sex indeed his chief failings I trace;</l>
<l>For the fair-ones so flatter'd his figure and face,</l>
<l>That too early he ceas'd the chaste Muses to follow,</l>
<l>And being Adonis, would not be Apollo.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Yet he has much fancy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>O, Madam, no doubt,</l>
<l>And genius that study would soon have brought out.</l>
<l>Had his thoughts been less turn'd to his legs and his looks,</l>
<l>Ere this he'd have written some excellent books:</l>
<l>'Tis pity such parts should thro' indolence fall;</l>
<l>But he never composes, and reads not at all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>Not read, Mr. Sapphic! you surely mistake;</l>
<l>Your friend cannot be an illiterate rake:</l>

<l>And not without saying some fine things of you:</l>
<l>He declares, that with those brilliant parts you possess,</l>
<l>'Tis a sin you ne'er send any work to the press.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>Good Sapphic! In truth 'tis his comfort to think</l>
<l>The whole duty of man lies in spilling of ink;</l>
<l><pb n="25" facs="24"/>And at Paradise gate his large volumes of metre</l>
<l>Will I hope be allow'd a fair pass by Saint Peter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Then the Saint must be free from your critical spirit,</l>
<l>For I know you have little esteem for their merit;</l>
<l>You're a rigorous judge, and to poets terrific.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>I wish my friend's muse was not quite so prolific:</l>
<l>But in rhymes when a child I have heard he would squeak,</l>
<l>And so proved a poet before he could speak;</l>
<l>On his death-bed, I doubt not, he'll still think of verse,</l>
<l>And groan out a rhyme to his doctor or nurse.</l>
</sp>

<l>This author is lucky to meet with a buyer:</l>
<l>A traveller's but a soft word for a liar.</l>

<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>Poor Pan! by the Graces thou'rt left in the lurch;</l>
<l>Thy temple will look like a trim parish church,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
<l>No; thanks to my Master,</l>
<l>You can hardly perceive that he e'er wore a plaister.</l>
<l>There never was known a more wonderful cure;</l>
<l>But kind Heaven assists my good Master I'm sure;</l>
<l>Without it the skill of no mortal could save</l>
<l>The many brave lads he has kept from the grave.</l>
<l>You would weep with delight to behold him surrounded</l>
<l>With a hundred fine fellows once horribly wounded;</l>
<l>Who with thanks for their lives are still eager to greet him,</l>
<l>And hail him with blessings whenever they meet him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
<l>God reward him, say I, for the good he has done;</l>
<l>And of those he has sav'd I am glad you are one.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
<l>Aye, twice he preserv'd me when all thought me dead,</l>
<l>And once brought me off at the risque of his head.</l>
<l>It was not his business to mix in the strife,</l>
<l>And some thought him mad when he ventur'd his life</l>
<l>To bring off a poor mangled private like me;</l>
<l>But I've still a heart left in this trunk that you see,</l>
<l>Which loves the brave spirit who snatch'd me from death,</l>
<l>And will serve him, I hope, till my very last breath.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="30"/>
<speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
<l>Your scenes of hard service I hope are all over;</l>
<l>It is now fairly time you should both live in clover.</l>
<l>Your Master, I trust, has brought home as much treasure</l>
<l>As will make him a parliament-man at his pleasure;</l>
<l>And to recompence you for the wound in your arm,</l>
<l>Perhaps he will buy you a snug little farm.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
<l>When a Gentleman comes from the East, my good girl,</l>
<l>You all think he is loaded with diamonds and pearl;</l>
<l>You fancy his treasure too great to be told,</l>
<l>And suppose he possesses a mountain of gold.</l>
<l>A few daring blades, by a bold kind of stealth,</l>
<l>Have indeed from the Indies brought home so much wealth,</l>
<l>That with all their keen senses they ne'er could employ it:</l>
<l>And have dy'd from the want of a heart to enjoy it:</l>
<l>But some hundred brave lads, whom gay youth led to enter</l>
<l>That promising region of hope and adventure,</l>
<l>Have toil'd many years in those rich-burning climes,</l>
<l>With small share of their wealth, and with none of their crimes.</l>
<l>Now my Master and I both belong to this tribe;</l>
<l>Not a single Nabob have we kill'd for a bribe;</l>
<l>And to tell you a truth, which I hope you'll not doubt,</l>
<l>We're as poor and as honest as when we set out.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
<l>What! your Master still poor in so thriving a trade!</l>
<l>And with patients so rich has he never been paid</l>
<l>For the wounds he has heal'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
<l>Yes, my dear, for his fees</l>
<l>I know he has touch'd many thousand rupees;</l>
<l><pb n="32" facs="31"/>But the fight of distress he could never endure;</l>
<l>What he took from the rich he bestow'd on the poor.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
<l>Well, Heaven will pay him, no doubt, in due season.</l>
<l>But what brings him home?—I would fain know the reason</l>
<l>Why he leaves that rich land in the bloom of his life:</l>
<l>I suppose from the want of a cherry-cheek'd wife?</l>
<l>They say those black wenches are sad nasty creatures,</l>
<l>And tho' they've fine shapes they have horrible features.</l>
<l>Does he want a white sweet-heart? or has he a black?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
<l>'Tis indeed a white woman that brings us both back:</l>
<l>But alas! 'tis an old one—my Master, it seems,</l>
<l>Has a fond simple mother that's troubled with dreams,</l>
<l>And he, like a tender and soft-hearted youth,</l>
<l>Resigns his fine prospect, and comes home forsooth</l>
<l>Because the old dame has express'd her desires</l>
<l>To see him in England before she expires:</l>
<l>And egad since he's come she will live long enough,</l>
<l>For she seems to be made of good durable stuff.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
<l>Well, now I shall love him a hundred times more</l>
<l>Than I did for the stories you told me before.</l>
<l>God bless the kind soul! who behaves to his mother</l>
<l>As if he well knew he could ne'er have another;</l>
<l>And were he my son I could not live without him;</l>
<l>I could stay here all day while you're talking about him.—</l>
<l>But 'tis time to be gone; we must both disappear,</l>
<l>For the Colonel's sweet Wife and your Master are here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
<l>Stop, I must peep at her;—she's as bright as the day!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="33" facs="32"/>
<speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
<l>And her heart is as good as her spirit is gay—</l>
<l>Come I'll shew you our walks—we may get out this way.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mrs. Felix <hi>and</hi> Morley.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Dear excellent Friend, since I owe to your worth</l>
<l>The safety of what I most value on earth,</l>
<l>With those it loves best my heart yields you a place,</l>
<l>And I clasp your kind hand with a sister's embrace.</l>
<l>To judge of the man whom such service endears</l>
<l>I want not the tardy acquaintance of years,</l>
<l>But in strong tho' guick ties, that no chances can sever,</l>
<l>In an instant he seizes my friendship for ever:</l>
<l>And had I much less obligation to you,</l>
<l>My regard and esteem I should still think your due,</l>
<l>From the picture my Felix has drawn of your mind.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>His warm soul to his friends is most partially kind:</l>
<l>But such as I am I most truly am yours;</l>
<l>Your goodness my grateful attachment ensures,</l>
<l>And my heart with proud transport your friendship embraces.</l>
<l>Tho' I ne'er gaz'd before on your personal graces,</l>
<l>I've beguil'd some long weeks of hard wearisome duty</l>
<l>With frequent discourse on your virtues and beauty;</l>
<l>And I own for the Colonel it rais'd my esteem,</l>
<l>To mark with what pleasure he dwelt on the theme.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>You're an excellent creature to sooth a fond Wife,</l>
<l>Who regards her Lord's love hardly less than his life;</l>
<l><pb n="34" facs="33"/>But since you've replied with good humour so steady</l>
<l>To the ten thousand questions I've ask'd you already,</l>
<l>I'll spare you to-day, and if 'tis in my power</l>
<l>Mention Felix's name only once in an hour.</l>
<l>That my thoughts to the Indies no longer may roam,</l>
<l>Let me talk to you now about matches at home;</l>
<l>Your counsel may make our perplexity less,</l>
<l>And finish our odd tragi-comic distress.</l>
<l>First tell me, and speak without any disguise,</l>
<l>(Tho' I fancy I read all your thoughts in your eyes)</l>
<l>What d'ye think of my Cousin?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Her graces indeed</l>
<l>The glowing description of Felix exceed;</l>
<l>Tho' in praising her, oft he with pleasure has smil'd</l>
<l>Like a father describing his favourite child.</l>
<l>For my part, I think she is lavishly blest</l>
<l>With those beauties by which the pure mind is exprest,</l>
<l>That her heart is with truth and with tenderness warm,</l>
<l>That sweet sensibility shines in her form;</l>
<l>A form, on which no man his eye ever turn'd</l>
<l>Without feeling his breast in her welfare concern'd.</l>
<l>'Tis the lot of such graces, wherever they dwell,</l>
<l>None can see their soft mistress and not wish her well.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Very gallantly said, and the praise is her due—</l>
<l>But how came her Lovers so well known to you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Her Lovers! —dear Madam, I hope you're in jest—</l>
<l>Or if by their vows your sweet Friend is addrest,</l>
<l>Heaven grant, for the peace of her delicate mind,</l>
<l>That her hand may be never to either resign'd!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="35" facs="34"/>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>From my soul I assure you I join in your prayer;</l>
<l>But whence does it spring?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>I will freely declare,</l>
<l>Tho' they're both men of fortune, fair birth, and good name,</l>
<l>With figures that set some young nymphs in a flame;</l>
<l>Tho' at each, many ladies are ready to catch</l>
<l>At what the world calls, a most excellent match;</l>
<l>Yet, if I have read your fair Cousin aright,</l>
<l>A bosom so tender, a spirit so bright,</l>
<l>Must be wretched with such a companion for life,</l>
<l>As each of these Lovers would prove to his Wife.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>You are right; but their characters where could you know?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>I knew them at college a few years ago,</l>
<l>Before, by a whimsical odd sort of fate,</l>
<l>And some family losses, too long to relate,</l>
<l>In Europe my views of prosperity ceas'd,</l>
<l>And chance sent me forth to my friends in the East.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Pray what sort of youths were these two modish men?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>You now find them both what they seem'd to be then;</l>
<l>Two characters form'd like most young men of fashion,</l>
<l>Whose cold selfish pride is their sovereign passion:</l>
<l>In each, tho' they're men of an opposite turn,</l>
<l>The same heart-freezing vanity still you discern,</l>
<l>To indulge that dear vanity, each still displays</l>
<l>All the force of his mind, tho' in different ways.</l>
<l><pb n="36" facs="35"/>Thence, in spinning weak verse Sapphic's toil never ends,</l>
<l>And Decisive ne'er stops in deriding his friends;</l>
<l>Each equally fancies no nymph can resist</l>
<l>His lips, which he thinks all the Graces have kist.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Perfect knowledge of both your just picture has shown!—</l>
<l>The warmth of these Lovers diverts me, I own.</l>
<l>Of conquest each seems to himself very clear,</l>
<l>And feels from his rivals no diffident fear.</l>
<l>'Tis easy to see from their satisfied air,</l>
<l>Each loves his own person much more than the Fair.</l>
<l>But my poor gentle Coz wishes both at a distance;</l>
<l>And I want to contrive, by your friendly assistance,</l>
<l>To relieve her, and quietly send them from hence</l>
<l>Without the Knight's knowledge.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>As neither wants sense,</l>
<l>Can't the Lady pronounce their dismission at once,</l>
<l>Which none can mistake but an impudent dunce?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>This measure seems easy indeed at first view;</l>
<l>But alas! 'tis a measure we dare not pursue.</l>
<l>Our warm-hearted, whimsical, positive Knight,</l>
<l>Allows not to woman this natural right;</l>
<l>And hence my young Friend, in a pitiful case,</l>
<l>Knows not how to reject what she ne'er can embrace;</l>
<l>For nothing her Uncle's resentment would smother,</l>
<l>Should she banish one suitor, and not take the other.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Then indeed I am griev'd for the Lady's distress;</l>
<l>But how can I aid her?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>'Tis hard, I confess,</l>
<l><pb n="37" facs="36"/>To a sudden retreat this bold pair to oblige,</l>
<l>And make two such Heroes abandon a siege;</l>
<l>Yet I wish we could do it—and when they recede,</l>
<l>The departure of both must appear their own deed,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY,</speaker>
<stage>after a pause.</stage>
<l>Well—my friendship for you has suggested a scheme.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>'Tis a service our hearts will for ever esteem.</l>
<l>But what is your project?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Don't question me what,</l>
<l>Lest you think me a fool for too simple a plot:</l>
<l>'Tis simple, and yet I would venture my life</l>
<l>It will drive from these Beaus all the thoughts of a Wife;</l>
<l>And if my scheme prospers, with joy I'll confess</l>
<l>What a whimsical trifle produc'd our success.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Well, keep your own secret, if silence is best;</l>
<l>Tho' a woman, for once I'll in ignorance rest. —</l>
<l>Here comes our friend Sapphic—he seems in a flurry.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>His step shews indeed a poetical hurry,</l>
<l>And we shall be call'd in as Gossips, fair neighbour,</l>
<l>For by the Bard's bustle his Muse is in labour.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Sapphic.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>Dear Ma'am! may I ask you for paper and ink,</l>
<l>Lest a fresh <hi>jeu d'esprit</hi> in oblivion should sink?</l>
<l>For when my free fancy has brought forth my verse,</l>
<l>My treacherous memory proves a bad nurse.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="38" facs="37"/>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>O pray! for your Muse let us rear her young chit,</l>
<l>For the bantling no doubt must have spirit and wit;</l>
<l>As a cradle to hold it, I beg you'll take that,</l>
<stage>(giving him a paper.)</stage>
<l>And your Friend here will aid you in dressing the Brat;</l>
<l>At a rite so important I merit no place,</l>
<l>And I beg to withdraw while you're washing its face.
<stage>Exit.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>That's a charming gay Creature—luxuriant and young—</l>
<l>But I've lost half a stanza—the deuce take her tongue;—</l>
<l>Let me see—let me see if I can't recollect it.—</l>
<l>'Tis done;—and now, Morley, pray hear or inspect it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>The Poet himself his own verse should recite.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>You're a sensible fellow—your maxim is right.</l>
<stage>(Reads.)</stage>
<l>"Thy old Arcadia, Pan, resign,</l>
<l>"For this more rich retreat:</l>
<l>"A fairer nymph here decks thy shrine;</l>
<l>"Be this thy fav'rite seat."</l>
<l>Well, my Friend, won't this bring the old God out of Greece?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Aye, and make good Sir Nicholas give you his Niece.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>Yes, I fancy this stanza will make the Girl mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>What Poet can wish for a prize more divine?</l>
<l>I give you much Joy on your conquest, my Friend;</l>
<l>Yet the eyes of regret on your nuptials I bend,</l>
<l><pb n="39" facs="38"/>And grieve in reflecting, that conjugal joy</l>
<l>Your poetical harvest of Fame must destroy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>What the deuce do you mean?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>To those great works adieu</l>
<l>Which the world now expects with impatience from you.</l>
<l>The Poet when blest can no more be sublime,</l>
<l>And a chill matrimonial must strike thro' his rhyme.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>You're mistaken, dear Doctor—connubial delight</l>
<l>Will give a new zest to each poem I write;</l>
<l>And you'll see such productions!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>'Tis true, now and then</l>
<l>Polemics by marriage have quicken'd their pen.</l>
<l>A Dutch Critic I knew, by the aid of his Wife,</l>
<l>Made a book and a child every year of his life.</l>
<l>But total seclusion from Venus and Bacchus,</l>
<l>Is, you know, to the Bard recommended by Flaccus.</l>
<l>A grand epic poem I hear you are writing;</l>
<l>'Tis a work that your country will take great delight in:</l>
<l>But consider, my Friend, when you're deep in heroics,</l>
<l>As Poets have not all the patience of Stoics,</l>
<l>How you'll grieve to be check'd in the flow of your verse,</l>
<l>By a young squalling child and an old scolding nurse;</l>
<l>E'en the qualms of your Lady may drive from your brain</l>
<l>Fine thoughts that you ne'er can recover again;</l>
<l>Reflect how you'll feel, with such hopes of succeeding,</l>
<l>If your Muse should miscarry because your Wife's breeding.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="40" facs="39"/>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>Egad, in that case I should think my fate hard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>I myself have beheld an unfortunate Bard,</l>
<l>Who his nails for a rhyme unsuccessfully bit,</l>
<l>When family cares had extinguish'd his wit.</l>
<l>With many who sing in the Muse's full choir,</l>
<l>It would do them no mischief to muffle their lyre;</l>
<l>But for you, whom the Nine, with a tender presage,</l>
<l>Are prepar'd to proclaim the first Bard of our age;</l>
<l>For you, who of Taste are the favourite theme—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAPPHIC.</speaker>
<l>Yes, I think I stand high in the public esteem.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>For you, I should grieve if domestic delight</l>
<l>On your fair rising laurels should fail as a blight.</l>
<l>'Tis the pride of great minds whom the Muses inflame,</l>
<l>To sacrifice joy on the altar of Fame:</l>
<l>Your passion's renown—of this Girl are you fonder?—</l>
<l>On this delicate point I must leave you to ponder;</l>
<l>Consider it, while I attend the old Knight.

<l>This Girl, tho' she's handsome, is but a dull thing.</l>
<l>'Tis clear, whensoe'er I a poem rehearse,</l>
<l>That she has no relish for elegant verse.—</l>
<l>Her fortune indeed would be rather convenient,</l>
<l>But the glorious to me is before the expedient.</l>

<l>Ah, Sir! would my Mistress were once of my mind,</l>

<l>O! talk not of anger with lips that inspire</l>
<l>The strongest sensation of rapturous fire,</l>
<l>That with love's sweet convulsions shake every nerve:</l>

<l>Young Man, I am not in a fury,</l>

<l>His honour and quiet let us make our care,</l>
<l>And bury in silence this foolish affair:</l>
<l>Perhaps, in my manners too easy and gay,</l>
<l>My levity led the young Poet astray.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>No, no! my good Creature, you must not arraign</l>
<l>Your innocent self in a business so plain:</l>
<l>Besides, his offence by this plea cannot sink,</l>
<l>For they are the worst of all puppies that think</l>
<l>Each woman's a wanton who is not precise,</l>
<l>And that cheerfulness must be the herald of vice.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Howe'er this may be—as he's now all repentance,</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mrs. Felix <hi>and</hi> Selina.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>WELL, my dear, what d'ye think of our medical friend</l>
<l>Whom the letters of Felix so highly commend?</l>
<l>If my gratitude does not my judgment mislead,</l>
<l>He's the man in the world who with you might succeed:</l>
<l>Tho' gentle, yet manly, tho' bashful, polite.</l>
<l>Are you not half in love?—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>Yes, indeed, at first sight!—</l>
<l>His service to you on my heart is engrav'd,</l>
<l>And I love him, I own, for the life he has sav'd,</l>
<l>To win me perhaps he might not find it hard,</l>
<l>So esteem'd as he is by the friends I regard;</l>
<l>But I fancy such thoughts will not enter his brain:</l>
<l>And for my part, instead of attracting a Swain,</l>
<l>I only shall think, as they heartily vex me,</l>
<l>Of escaping from those who already perplex me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>O make yourself easy, I pray, on that head;</l>
<l>In the deepest disgrace the poor Poet is fled,</l>
<l>And I trust that the Critic will soon share his fate.</l>
<l>Come with me—I've a most curious tale to relate.</l>
<l>Let us haste—I perceive that Decisive is near,</l>
<l>In whose present discourse I would not interfere.

<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>So while in the grove I was coolly projecting</l>
<l>New plans for the temple the Knight is erecting,</l>
<l>Our Poet, addicted to amorous sin,</l>
<l>Grew a little too fond of the Ladies within:</l>
<l>But discovery happen'd his passion to damp;</l>
<l>And this is the cause of his haste to decamp.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>The old Knight, I believe, such resentment express'd</l>
<l>As quicken'd the speed of his fugitive guest;</l>
<l>On Terror's swift wing he is certainly flown,</l>
<l>And as he has retreated, the field is your own.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>As a rival I had not much fear of poor Sapphic;</l>
<l>Bad rhyme's current coin in most amorous traffic,</l>
<l>But would not pass here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>I think not in your view,</l>
<l>As it finds such a critical touchstone in you.</l>
<l>The Poet's dismission your triumph ensures,</l>
<l>And the prize, my good friend, is now certainly yours;</l>
<l>A prize, that we justly may call very great,</l>
<l>A lovely sweet Girl with a noble estate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>The Girl's very well, but knows nothing of life;</l>
<l>It will cost me some pains to new model my Wife;</l>
<l>But I think she will gladly receive my correction,</l>
<l>And my wealthy old Kinsman approve the connection.</l>
</sp>
<stage>(<hi>Coughs.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>You've a cough, my good Friend,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="51" facs="50"/>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>Yes, a trifling one: <hi>Hem!</hi></l>
<l>Have you got any Indian prescription for phlegm?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, that cough is no trifling affair;</l>
<l>It calls, I assure you, for caution and care.</l>
<l>With regret I point out so unpleasant a truth,</l>
<l>But your constitution I've known from your youth;</l>
<l>Your hectic appearance I see with concern,</l>
<l>As I know, with your frame if health takes such a turn,</l>
<l>The least indiscretion your life may destroy.</l>
<l>The slightest excess in diversion and joy;</l>
<l>Even those tender cares, which on life's purest plan</l>
<l>Must belong to the state of a Family Man,</l>
<l>May lead to disease from which art cannot save,</l>
<l>And rapidly hurry you into the grave.</l>
<l>'Twere better this courtship of yours should miscarry,</l>
<l>For you'll certainly die in six months if you marry.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>Are you serious, dear Doctor?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>By such a sad end</l>
<l>I lately have lost a poor good-humour'd friend.</l>
<l>You remember Jack Dangle at College, no doubt;</l>
<l>He was just of your age, and a little more stout;</l>
<l>He, with other young sages, left Westminster Hall</l>
<l>To teach English law to the slaves of Bengal.</l>
<l>But Jack, in his new chamber-practice at least,</l>
<l>Too eagerly follow'd the rules of the East.</l>
<l>A bad cough ensu'd, much like yours in its found—</l>
<stage>(Decisive <hi>coughs.)</hi></stage>
<l>Good God! I could swear 'twas poor Jack under ground,</l>
<l><pb n="52" facs="51"/>'Tis his tone so exactly, sepulchral and hollow!</l>
<l>The system he slighted I hope you will follow.</l>
<l>With pains in his breast he was sharply tormented;</l>
<l>But as he at first to my guidance consented,</l>
<l>Some time my strict regimen kept him alive,</l>
<l>Poor Dangle once more was beginning to thrive;</l>
<l>And had he some months in my plan persever'd,</l>
<l>On the earth at this moment he might have appear'd;</l>
<l>But chance threw a pretty white girl in his way,</l>
<l>And eager for marriage, fond Jack would not stay:</l>
<l>In vain I conjur'd him to wait half a year,</l>
<l>And shew'd him the danger he ran very clear.</l>
<l>He thought the remains of his cough but a trifle,</l>
<l>And being unable his passion to stifle,</l>
<l>He took his fair wife;—but, alas! the vile cough</l>
<l>Encreas'd every day till it carried him off!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>I don't recollect any pain in my breast,</l>
<l>But I feel a strange tightness just now in my chest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>How's your stomach?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>I've nothing to fear on that score.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Do you eat as you did?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>Yes, I think rather more.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>That ravenous hunger's the thing that I dread.</l>
<l>How d'ye sleep?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>All the time that I pass in my bed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="53" facs="52"/>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Indeed!—I don't like so lethargic a slumber.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>Why! my Friend! of good symptoms these rank in the number.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Alas! you may call them all good if you please,</l>
<l>By that title you only confirm your disease,</l>
<l>In which, tho' the patient declines very fast,</l>
<l>He for ever will flatter himself to the last.</l>
<l>Believe me, your symptoms are rather alarming,</l>
<l>Yet your present disorder there is not much harm in.</l>
<l>If you can but abstain, with a spirit resign'd,</l>
<l>From all that may harrass your body or mind,</l>
<l>To a different climate I wish you'd repair,</l>
<l>And for one Winter breathe a less changeable air.</l>
<l>Spend a Christmas at Naples, and when you return</l>
<l>You may marry without any anxious concern.</l>
<l>But you're now at that critical period of life</l>
<l>When, in such frames as yours, nature feels an odd strife,</l>
<l>And, if quiet does not all her functions befriend,</l>
<l>The short earthly scene on a sudden will end.</l>
<l>On a point so important you'll pardon my freedom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>Your cautions oblige me, I feel that I need 'em,</l>
<l>For in truth I am growing as thin as a rabbit,</l>
<l>And there's something consumptive I know in my habit.</l>
<l>My father died soon after taking a Wife,</l>
<l>And cough'd out his soul when I jump'd into life:</l>
<l>I suppose I am going.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Take courage, my Friend;</l>
<l>On your own prudent conduct your life will depend.</l>
<l><pb n="54" facs="53"/>If you take but due care for two years, I'll engage</l>
<l>You will stand a fair chance for a healthy old age.</l>
<l>Nor would I advise you this Girl to refuse,</l>
<l>A distant attachment your mind will amuse;</l>
<l>And, no doubt, for a man of your fortune and figure</l>
<l>She will wait till your health has recover'd its vigour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DECISIVE.</speaker>
<l>I can part with the Girl without feeling a chasm</l>
<l>In my heart; that will shake with no amorous spasm;</l>
<l>For, to tell you the truth, my old rich Uncle Cob</l>
<l>Is more eager than I for this marrying job.</l>
<l>By this scheme the old Blade is supremely delighted,</l>
<l>Because two large manors may thus be united:</l>
<l>But when of his park I've extended the bound,</l>
<l>It will do me small good if I sink under ground;</l>
<l>And I'm not such a fool in these projects of pelf,</l>
<l>To humour my friends and endanger myself.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Indeed I'd not wed for an old Uncle's whim;</l>
<l>But here comes our Knight, I shall leave you with him,</l>
<l>As I think you've some delicate points to adjust.

<l>Dear Sir, upon weighing in Reason's just scales</l>
<l>Your very great favours and my weak pretension,</l>
<l>I find I'm unworthy of such condescension,</l>
<l>And must, with regret, the high honour resign,</l>
<l>Which I once vainly thought might with justice be mine.</l>
</sp>

<l>Hey-day! what does all this formality mean?</l>
<l>Why Dick! has the Devil possess'd you with spleen?</l>
<l>Or has Love made your mind thus with diffidence sore?</l>
<l>False modesty ne'er was your foible before.</l>
<l>You think you're unworthy!—the thought is so new,</l>
<l>That I hardly can tell what to say or to do.</l>
<l>If you love the good Girl full as much as you said,</l>
<l>I think you have very just claims to her bed;</l>
<l>But if your mind's chang'd, and you feel your love lighter,</l>
<l>'Tis better to say so, than marry and slight her:</l>
<l><pb n="56" facs="55"/>And if this be the case, Sir, you have your release;</l>
<l>For although I am eager to marry my Niece,</l>

<l>The Bard is too warm, and the Critic too cold.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>I find that they are not such Lads as I thought 'em;</l>
<l>The World all the worst of its fashions has taught 'em:</l>
<l>And the World is indeed at a very fine pass,</l>
<l>When such Puppies insult so attractive a Lass.</l>
<l>Young Fellows of fortune now think it hard duty</l>
<l>To pay a chaste homage to Virtue and Beauty.</l>
<l>But I'll leave these pert Fops to their own vile caprice,</l>
<l>And soon find a much fitter match for my Niece.</l>
<l>Other orders of men for a husband I'll search,</l>
<l>And I think I can settle my Girl in the Church.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Lord, Cousin! I thought you detested the Cloth!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>Our Rector I own often kindles my wrath;</l>
<l>But all Parsons are not like my neighbour, old Squabble,</l>
<l>Who has learnt from his geese both to hiss and to gobble,</l>
<l><pb n="58" facs="57"/>We have in our neighbourhood three young Divines,</l>
<l>And each, I believe, to Selina inclines.</l>
<l>Our Bishop's smart Nephew deserves a sweet Wench,</l>
<l>He himself in due time may be rais'd to the Bench;</l>
<l>With him I should like very well to unite her:</l>
<l>And if he hereafter should rise to the Mitre,</l>
<l>Then perhaps we together might bring to perfection</l>
<l>A much-wanted plan for the Church's correction.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>A very fine scheme which you'll manage, no doubt!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>More wonderful things I have known brought about;</l>
<l>And tho' my first plan, as you see, has miscarried,</l>
<l>I'm resolv'd that my Niece shall be speedily married.</l>
<l>I'll unite the good Girl to a Priest, if I'm able;</l>
<l>For the young Olive Branch never fails at his table.</l>
<l>There is one I prefer—but to leave the Girl free,</l>
<l>I allow her to make a fair choice of the Three:</l>
<l>I shall therefore invite the whole groupe to the hall,</l>
<l>And I'll now go and make her write cards to them all.
<stage>Exit.</stage></l>

<l>What a wonderful creature is this worthy Knight!</l>
<l>To make others happy is all his delight!</l>
<l>Yet, misled by some wild philanthropic illusion,</l>
<l>He's for ever involv'd in odd scenes of confusion.</l>
<l>'Tis well that our Critic has made his last bow,</l>
<l>I rejoice he's remov'd, and I long to know how.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Morley.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Thank my stars, my dear Ma'am, I've dispatch'd your commission;</l>
<l>Your sweet Friend is, I hope, in a tranquil condition:</l>
<l><pb n="59" facs="58"/>From her two irksome Lovers she now is reliev'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>And I'm dying to know how all this was atchiev'd.</l>
<l>Come tell me, good Creature, how could you effect it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>By a project so simple you'd never suspect it:</l>
<l>I have banish'd both Swains, by declaring a Wife</l>
<l>Would rob one of glory, and t'other of life.</l>
<l>I persuaded the Bard his poetical fame</l>
<l>Could never exist with a conjugal flame:</l>
<l>Hence he grew with your charms so licentiously free,</l>
<l>But forgive me this ill which I could not foresee.</l>
<l>Decisive, more wisely, abandons the Fair</l>
<l>To make his own lungs his particular care.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>What! on such points as these have they taken your word?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Dear Madam! mankind credit things most absurd,</l>
<l>When they come from the mouth of a medical man;</l>
<l>Hence Mountebanks never want skill to trepan.</l>
<l>The extent of our empire indeed there's no seeing,</l>
<l>When we act on the fears of a true selfish being.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>How simple soever the means you've employ'd,</l>
<l>You have remedy'd ills by which we were annoy'd.</l>
<l>Having thus clear'd the scene from each troublesome Lover,</l>
<l>Can you not for the Nymph a fit Husband discover?</l>
<l>You see how she's prest by her Uncle to wed,</l>
<l>Who ne'er quits a scheme he once takes in his head.—</l>
<l>Suppose her kind fancy should lean towards you,</l>
<l>Is your heart quite as free as I'm sure 'twould be true?</l>
<l>Is it not pre-engag'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="60" facs="59"/>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>As in mirth's sportive sally</l>
<l>It pleases you thus a poor pilgrim to rally,</l>
<l>Your good nature I know will forgive me if I</l>
<l>To your pleasantry make a too serious reply.</l>
<l>'Tis my maxim to speak, whatsoe'er be the theme,</l>
<l>With a heart undisguis'd to the friends I esteem:</l>
<l>Had I all India's wealth, 'twould be my inclination</l>
<l>To offer it all to your lovely Relation.</l>
<l>But supposing it possible you could be willing</l>
<l>To unite her with one who is scarce worth a shilling;</l>
<l>Believe me, dear Madam, my pride is too great</l>
<l>To wish her to stoop to my humble estate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Such pride, tho' it rests upon no strong foundation,</l>
<l>Is noble, I own, and deserves admiration.</l>
<l>I call it ill-founded, because, in my mind,</l>
<l>If there's fortune enough for a couple when join'd,</l>
<l>If talents and worth are by each duly shar'd,</l>
<l>If in all other points they are equally pair'd,</l>
<l>And mutual regard mutual merit enhances,</l>
<l>It signifies not which supply'd their finances.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Your pardon—how often when fortune's unequal,</l>
<l>Gay weddings produce a most turbulent sequel?</l>
<l>But could I once hope your sweet Cousin to gain,</l>
<l>How many things are there such hopes to restrain?</l>
<l>Suppose your dear Colonel, my most noble Friend,</l>
<l>Whom success to your arms may more speedily send!</l>
<l>Suppose, having clos'd the bright work he has plann'd,</l>
<l>His return from the East he should hasten by land;</l>
<l><pb n="61" facs="60"/>Suppose him arriv'd, with what face could I meet</l>
<l>The man whom my heart should exultingly greet,</l>
<l>If he found me attempting, in spite of my station,</l>
<l>To wed, tho' a beggar, your wealthy Relation?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>From these words my dear Friend, which I almost adore,</l>
<l>And a few slighter hints that escap'd you before,</l>
<l>I have caught a quick hope, which is fraught with delight,</l>
<l>That I soon shall be blest with my Felix's sight:</l>
<l>I begin to suspect he's in England already;</l>
<l>I perceive that you can't keep your countenance steady,</l>
<l>With his usual attention his love has reflected</l>
<l>How my poor foolish nerves by surprise are affected;</l>
<l>And lest they should fail me beyond all revival,</l>
<l>Has sent you to prepare for his wish'd-for arrival.</l>
<l>Am I right in my guess? Is he not very near?</l>
<l>Could I trust my own heart, I should think Felix here,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLONEL FELIX,</speaker>
<stage>entering.</stage>
<l>Sweet Foreboder, behold him restor'd to your arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>O my Felix! this transport o'erpays all alarms,</l>
<l>Thus to see thee restor'd, and ennobled with fame!</l>
<l>In what words shall affection thy welcome proclaim?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLONEL.</speaker>
<l>My love! my blest Treasure! than glory more dear!</l>
<l>The bliss of this meeting, which shines in thy tear,</l>
<l>That we owe to this Friend let us never forget.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>My share in your transport o'erpays all the debt.—</l>
<l>But, Colonel, your fondness has travell'd full speed,</l>
<l>And has not allow'd me the time you agreed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="62" facs="61"/>
<speaker>COLONEL.</speaker>
<l>I meant not, indeed, to have join'd you to-day,</l>
<l>But I found Love forbade my intended delay.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Well, my duty is done, now you happily meet;</l>
<l>Heaven bless you together!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Stay, stay, I entreat;</l>
<l>You must not go yet; and before you depart,</l>
<l>I will open to Felix the scheme of my heart.</l>

<l>Indeed, Sir, I never can write such a card.</l>
</sp>

<stage><hi>(behind the scene.</hi>)</stage>
<l>Then you'll forfeit at once my paternal regard!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLONEL.</speaker>
<l>Hey-day! in the house I much fear something's wrong,</l>
<l>As Sir Nicholas talks in a language so strong.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Does he know you are here?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLONEL.</speaker>
<l>No, my Dear, I think not,</l>
<l>Unless he the tidings from Jenny has got;</l>
<l>She alone saw me come, and without much ado</l>
<l>Most kindly directed me where to find you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>They are coming this way—let's withdraw all together,</l>
<l>And contrive how to turn this loud storm to fair weather.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt.</stage>
<stage><pb n="63" facs="62"/><hi>Enter</hi> Sir Nicholas <hi>and</hi> Selina.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>I insist on your writing such cards to 'em all!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>Dear Uncle, I beg you'll this order recall.</l>
<l>You know your commands I much wish to obey;</l>
<l>But reflect on this matter what people will say:</l>
<l>You're so eager to marry your Niece, they will swear,</l>
<l>That you hawk her about just like goods at a fair.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>Well, my Dear, let 'em say so, and I'll say so too,</l>
<l>For your simile proves what a Guardian should do.</l>
<l>He who wants to dispose of a tender young maid,</l>
<l>May take a good hint from the gingerbread trade:</l>
<l>If he has any sense, 'twill be ever his plan</l>
<l>To part with soft pastry as soon as he can;</l>
<l>For, egad, an old maid is like old harden'd paste,</l>
<l>You may cry it about, but nobody will taste.</l>
<l>Come, do as I bid you, and take up your pen.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>Lord, Sir! it will seem very odd to these men;</l>
<l>You will make me appear in a horrible light;</l>
<l>I vow my hand shakes so, I never can write.</l>
<l>Excuse me, dear Sir, from this business, pray do,</l>
<l>And let me live single for ever with you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>All business where woman's concern'd, I believe,</l>
<l>Must partake of the curse from our Grandmother Eve.</l>
<l>All her Daughters the steps of their Parent have follow'd,</l>
<l>Contradiction, the core of the apple she swallow'd,</l>
<l>In their veins still fermenting new ills can produce,</l>
<l>And all their blood seems Coloquintida juice.—</l>
<l><pb n="64" facs="63"/>You froward cross Baggage! your word should I take,</l>
<l>And bid you live single five years for my sake,</l>
<l>Of the barbarous Uncle you'd quickly complain,</l>
<l>Who from Nature's just right a young Girl wou'd restrain!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>Indeed, Sir, I should not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>I tell you you wou'd.</l>
<l>From perverseness alone you oppose your own good.</l>
<l>'Tis only to thwart me, because I desire</l>
<l>To see you well settled before I expire,</l>
<l>That you now with your soft hypocritical carriage,</l>
<l>Affect to have no inclination to marriage.</l>
<l>But you'll never contrive, tho' your tongue may be nimble,</l>
<l>To convince me your heart is as cold as your thimble.</l>
<l>I know of what stuff froward damsels are made,</l>
<l>The Guardian must force you who cannot persuade.</l>
<l>That you'll like a good husband, I never can doubt;</l>
<l>And married you shall be before the month's out,</l>
<l>Or at least your kind Uncle no more you shall teaze,</l>
<l>But may e'en go to Rome and turn Nun if you please.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<stage>(<hi>aside.</hi>)</stage>
<l>I have lost all the love he has shewn me for years;</l>
<l>If I strive to reply I shall burst into tears.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>COLONEL.</speaker>
<l>My worthy old Friend, what can make you so hot?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>Ha, Colonel!—you find me a little concern'd—</l>
<l>But I'm heartily glad you are safely return'd.</l>
<l><pb n="65" facs="64"/>Your arrival indeed is a welcome surprize,</l>
<l>Tho' before you your fame a bright harbinger flies;</l>
<l>We have heard your success, and we all triumph in it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLONEL.</speaker>
<l>I trust I am come in a fortunate minute</l>
<l>To make all your present embarrassment cease,</l>
<l>For I bring a young Husband, my Friend, for your Niece.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>Egad that's well said; and I'm sure it's well meant;</l>
<l>And if he's like you he shall have my consent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLONEL.</speaker>
<l>He has many more virtues, and just as much wealth,</l>
<l>And from India brings home both his morals and health.</l>
<l>Here, my Friend, is the Man.—As I owe him my life,</l>
<l>I wish to present him so lovely a Wife;</l>
<l>Half my fortune is his—here I freely declare it,</l>
<l>And have only to hope that Selina may share it.</l>
<l>I've regarded her long as a child of my own;</l>
<l>Nor can my affection more truly be shown,</l>
<l>Than by wishing to place the dear Girl in the arms</l>
<l>Of the friend whose rare virtues are worthy her charms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>Dear generous Felix, I'm quite overcome,</l>
<l>Thy Bounty is such, it strikes Gratitude dumb!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLONEL.</speaker>
<l>This was ever, my Friend, my most settled intention,</l>
<l>Though my very just purpose I chose not to mention,</l>
<l>From the hope I should find, what I gladly embrace,</l>
<l>A moment from which it may borrow some grace,</l>
<l>When my gift its plain value may rise far above,</l>
<l>By the aid it affords to the wishes of Love;</l>
<l><pb n="66" facs="65"/>And I own, as a prophet, I'm proud of my art,</l>
<l>Now I see the effects of her charms on your heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>O Felix! can I thus deprive thy free spirit</l>
<l>Of wealth, the reward of heroical merit?</l>
<l>Can I the victorious Commander despoil</l>
<l>Of what he has purchas'd with danger and toil▪</l>
<l>Should love and delight on thy present attend,</l>
<l>I could never be happy in robbing a Friend.</l>
<l>No, I still must decline—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>My dear Boy, say no more;</l>
<l>You're the match that I never could meet with before.</l>
<l>I have long sought in vain for an heir to my mind,</l>
<l>But all my soul wish'd, in your spirit I find.</l>
<l>You shall <hi>not</hi> rob your Friend of a single <note n="†" place="foot">An Indian Coin.</note> Gold Mohr,</l>
<l>He can raise heirs enough to inherit his store:</l>
<l>To such men as himself let him haste to give birth,</l>
<l>And with twenty young Felixs garnish the earth.</l>
<l>How trifling soever your fortune may be,</l>
<l>From the Colonel's esteem, and the virtues I see,</l>
<l>I think you as noble a match for my Niece,</l>
<l>As I could, had you brought home a new golden fleece:</l>
<l>I have money enough, if you're rich in affection.—</l>
<l>As I always have talk'd of an equal connection,</l>
<l>My neighbours, perhaps, may suppose my sight dim,</l>
<l>Or mock my wise choice as a generous whim:</l>
<l>Let them study with zeal, which I hope may succeed,</l>
<l>Of their horses and dogs to improve the best breed;</l>
<l>A study more noble engrosses my mind,</l>
<l>To preserve the first points in the breed of mankind:</l>
<l><pb n="67" facs="66"/>On the heart and the soul, as the first points, I dwell,</l>
<l>In these, my dear Children, you match mighty well,</l>
<l>And I think human nature in debt to my care,</l>
<l>For uniting two mortals who happily pair.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLONEL.</speaker>
<l>Your hand, my dear Knight, it is gloriously said!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>By Juno we'll put the young couple to bed!</l>
<l>We'll have no dull delays.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. FELIX.</speaker>
<l>Now what say you, my Dear,</l>
<l>Are these orders for marriage too quick and severe?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>My amazement and gratitude both are extreme,</l>
<l>But my voice seems opprest in a heavenly dream:</l>
<l>Though your kindness is greater than language can paint,</l>
<l>I beg this fair hand may be free from constraint.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir NICHOLAS.</speaker>
<l>From constraint!—Gad, if now she affects to demur,</l>
<l>I can tell her, my wrath she shall so far incur,</l>
<l>She shall go to a convent for life, or at least</l>
<l>Be sent as a venture herself to the East.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELINA.</speaker>
<l>My Uncle I long have obey'd, and at present</l>
<l>I cannot complain his commands are unpleasant;</l>
<l>Nay more; could he place all mankind in my view,</l>
<l>And bid me chuse from them, my choice would be you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORLEY.</speaker>
<l>To this dear declaration my life must reply,</l>
<l>All words are too weak—</l>
