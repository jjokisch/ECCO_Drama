<stage>DONNA LEONORA, DONNA ELVIRA;</stage>
<stage>(<hi>Enter opposite sides</hi>).</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>HAIL to my darling Child! This smiling morn</l>
<l>Rises auspicious to behold my joy;</l>
<l>This is the birth-day of thy regal power:</l>
<l>And my child mounts this Day her Father's Throne.</l>
<l>Revolted Arragon now courts thy sway,</l>
<l>And with repentant heart, wrenching thy sceptre</l>
<l>From Garcia's grasp, repairs its long rebellion.</l>
<l>The Deputies ere noon will here arrive,</l>
<l>From exile to recall thee, and restore,</l>
<l>With signal honours, thy long ravish'd Kingdom:</l>
<l>To swear allegiance, and to hail thee Queen.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="148" facs="161"/>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA</speaker>
<l>Oh! may that Crown, which Heaven, this Day, restores me,</l>
<l>Add to my Mother's bliss, as to her power;</l>
<l>Though Queen, I still her subject shall remain.</l>
<l>Her prudent counsels, and her wise resolves,</l>
<l>Will sway and safely guide my youthful mind.</l>
<l>This is indeed a Day of high import;</l>
<l>Alike distinguish'd by eventful fate,</l>
<l>To fix for Arragon, and rich Castile,</l>
<l>A future Monarch on their envy'd Thrones.</l>
<l>This Day the beauteous Isabella names</l>
<l>The Husband of her choice, and crowns him King.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>O my Elvira! wouldst thou fix thy choice,</l>
<l>And now select a partner of thy Throne;</l>
<l>From anxious care my mind would be reliev'd.</l>
<l>Troubles, from long misrule, will rise in Arragon;</l>
<l>And I am all thy counsel, or defence:</l>
<l>And can I on that Throne protect my Child,</l>
<l>Which all her Father's valour fail'd to guard?</l>
<l>A valiant Husband's arm would prop thy state;</l>
<l>Disperse the mutinous, and quell rebellion.</l>
<l>Let prudence plead the cause of love, Elvira!</l>
<l>Reward the godlike passion of Alvarez,</l>
<l>Who sought thy hand, whilst hopeless of a Crown.</l>
<l>Now emulate the worth thy soul esteems;</l>
<l>And generous in thy turn, be grateful too:</l>
<l>Let thy first act, as Queen, be nobly just,</l>
<l>Ascend thy Throne, and name Alvarez King.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="149" facs="162"/>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>Heaven well rewards his virtuous deeds to me.</l>
<l>A Throne, more splendid far than mine, now courts him,</l>
<l>With Isabella, in Castile to reign.</l>
<l>The brave Castilians name him of the <hi>Three</hi></l>
<l>From whom they wish their Queen to chuse a Consort.</l>
<l>First, my dear Mother! let me mount my throne,</l>
<l>Before I fix with whom, that Throne to share.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Ah! my foreboding fears! Your choice is made.</l>
<l>Reflect, my Child! whilst yet the power remains,</l>
<l>What grief, what dangers may await your love.</l>
<l>Resist this fatal impulse of your heart,</l>
<l>Which will embitter all your future life.</l>
<l>Could my maternal bosom yield consent,</l>
<l>Yet would the Nobles of your Realm submit</l>
<l>To bow the knee to one, plebeian born?</l>
<l>Too much, alas! the valiant Carlos charms you.</l>
<l>But what avails his matchless worth? His blood</l>
<l>Springs from some base, contaminated source,</l>
<l>Which he, through pride, with conscious shame, conceals.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>Yet, though conceal'd, its source may be most pure.</l>
<l>For have not princes, men of high renown,</l>
<l>Disguis'd themselves, their names, and birth deny'd,</l>
<l>Whose swords alone have signaliz'd their fame;</l>
<l>Subduing kingdoms, and bestowing crowns:</l>
<l><pb n="150" facs="163"/>Singly the fate of empires, and of kings.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Is this the flattering hope your heart has cherish'd?</l>
<l>And the distinction which you pay to Carlos,</l>
<l>Is it then love, grafted on hope fallacious?</l>
<l>Ah! my dear Child! give not such room for censure,</l>
<l>Nor cherish sentiments, you must subdue.</l>
<l>Avoid the converse which destroys your peace,</l>
<l>And lends the venom'd tongue of slander, speech.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>Such rare endowments, and such gallant worth,</l>
<l>As Carlos owns, in noble minds, excite</l>
<l>Esteem, complacent friendship, and urbanity.</l>
<l>I but that tribute of regard bestow,</l>
<l>Which his transcendent virtues justly claim;</l>
<l>Chaste as a sister's innocent affection.</l>
<l>Can this reflect upon my virgin fame,</l>
<l>Or draw the breath of calumny against me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Beauty and youth, with princely rank combin'd,</l>
<l>Winning admirers, draw observers too.</l>
<l>The storm, unheeded, deluges the weed,</l>
<l>Whilst, on the garden's pride, the peerless lily,</l>
<l>And the sweet, opening rose, not unobserv'd</l>
<l>Hang, e'en the freshning dew-drops of the morn.</l>
<l>Carlos commands respect from ev'ry heart;</l>
<l>And, did his merits less conspicuous shine,</l>
<l>Your gentle soul uncensur'd might esteem him.</l>
<l>But to each virtue, that adorns the man,</l>
<l>A warrior's valour, and a hero's fame,</l>
<l><pb n="151" facs="164"/>He adds each striking, each attractive grace;</l>
<l>Commanding, awful, yet inspiring love;</l>
<l>In port a monarch, and in mind a god.</l>
<l>When he appears, each eye with pride surveys him;</l>
<l>All seem to take a fashion from his mien,</l>
<l>And with complacent hope, admire their model.</l>
<l>Though ev'ry lady courts him by her smiles,</l>
<l>Whom has he yet distinguish'd but yourself?</l>
<l>Save when he pays his duty to his Queen.</l>
<l>In his attention you such pleasure take,</l>
<l>That you betray—more than esteem for Carlos.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>That homage which queens claims, does Carlos offer;</l>
<l>He pays his court like others, who approach me;</l>
<l>Worth, such as his, knows no temerity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>With you to Arragon does Carlos go,</l>
<l>Only to pay his court, as here he pays it?</l>
<l>The worth he owns may make his thoughts aspire;</l>
<l>And he, who guards your Throne, may hope your love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>War is the element of souls like his;</l>
<l>From victory to victory they fly;</l>
<l>Glory their idol, and their wish distinction.</l>
<l>Seville dismantled, and the Moors defeated,</l>
<l>Castile, triumphant, wants his arm no more.</l>
<l>His great ambition, thus without an object</l>
<l>Offers his sword against our Rebel, Garcia.</l>
<l>His valour will achieve, what, with success.</l>
<l><pb n="152" facs="165"/>Our subjects have begun; chase this Usurper,</l>
<l>And bid fair peace, and safety, grace my Throne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>But, when his conqu'ring sword has fix'd your reign,</l>
<l>Your subjugated Vassals at your feet,</l>
<l>Will Carlos quit your Realm, to seek fresh toils;</l>
<l>Nor hope that Crown, his valour may have sav'd?—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>Madam! the Queen approaches to give audience.</l>
</sp>
</div3>
<div3 n="2" type="scene">
<head>SCENE SECOND.</head>
<stage>DONNA ISABELLA, DONNA LEONORA, DONNA ELVIRA, BLANCHE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>This Day then, Madam! this distinguish'd Day,</l>
<l>You will reward some happy lover's flame?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>I, at my People's prayer, proclaim a King:</l>
<l>A Husband chuse, a partner of my Throne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>Alas! methinks my royal friend appears</l>
<l>With more than usual sadness in her eye.</l>
<l>Long has her heart conceal'd a load of grief,</l>
<l>Refus'd to make me partner of the cause,</l>
<l>And shunn'd my converse, save in hours of state.</l>
<l>My joy, on this eventful Day, believe me,</l>
<l><pb n="153" facs="166"/>Will want its charms, if Isabella mourn;</l>
<l>With such delight she hail'd my change of fortune,</l>
<l>I thought, last night, that all her griefs were fled.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Still, my Elvira! does my heart rejoice</l>
<l>In thy recover'd Crown; e'en whilst I sigh</l>
<l>To lose the friend, I from my cradle lov'd.</l>
<l>Thy joy alone can gladden my sad soul,</l>
<l>Oppress'd, and harrass'd by corroding care.</l>
<l>I sacrifice my peace this fatal Day;</l>
<l>But to the State's repose, I yield my own.</l>
<l>All the Grandees, ambitious of the Crown,</l>
<l>Embroil, by their intrigues, the public peace.</l>
<l>To terminate their feuds, I name a King:</l>
<l>Castile, through all her States, conjures me to it.</l>
<l>And, by my order, three Grandees elects,</l>
<l>To <hi>one</hi> of whom, I this <hi>hour</hi> give my Throne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Three most renowned Heroes they elect;</l>
<l>Don Manrique, Lopez, and the brave Alvarez,</l>
<l>Though not of royal blood, are worthy thrones.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Ah! what to me avail the shouts of fame,</l>
<l>Which hail them idols of the public choice,</l>
<l>If of my heart, the gallant Don Alvarez,</l>
<l>Lopez, nor Manrique, be the chosen lord?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Though nam'd, to them your choice is not confin'd.</l>
<l>Speak your heart's wish, your Vassals will obey.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="154" facs="167"/>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Though born my Subjects, yet I am their Slave;</l>
<l>And bound by laws Kings tremble to infringe.</l>
<l>A royal rank imposes stern restraints;</l>
<l>The hearts of Kings must neither love nor hate.</l>
<l>I am less free than e'en my meanest subject;</l>
<l>Chain'd by fastidious glory to her car,</l>
<l>Which nice, imperious, jealous, honour guides:</l>
<l>My heart must feel for others, not myself,</l>
<l>Each wish ungratify'd, each grief disdain'd—</l>
<stage><hi>(Stops short.</hi>)</stage>
<stage>(<hi>To Blanche, who speaks to an Attendant.</hi>)</stage>
<l>Are the States met?
<stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage>
Oh! could this fatal Choice</l>
<l>Be still delay'd, or never, never, made!</l>
<l>Calm, gracious Heaven! this conflict of my soul,</l>
<l>Direct my actions, and inspire my thoughts!</l>
</sp>
<stage>(<hi>The scene dividing gives entrance into a magnificent Presence-Chamber. A royal throne under a canopy. Two chairs of state in a line with the throne. At the right-hand of the throne a small ornamented stand, higher than a table, upon which the Sceptre and Regalia are placed. Seats ranged on each side of the throne to the front of the stage: the Grandees &amp; Officers of the Spanish Court standing before them. The Royal Guards standing behind the seats. The Grandees take off their hats, and remain uncovered till the Queen

<l>Lopez, Alvarez, Manrique! whom my States</l>

<l>Not from their favour, but your own free choice,</l>
<l>Do I presuming think to gain your hand:</l>
<l>An honour which I scarcely dare to hope,</l>
<l>But as a bliss unmerited is hop'd for.</l>
<l>I own your Power to give, without control,</l>
<l>That hand, which monarchs proudly might dispute,</l>
<l>E'en to the meanest subject in Castile.</l>
<l>Yet this unprecedented grace I trust,</l>
<l>Will on the least unworthy be conferr'd:</l>
<l><pb n="157" facs="170"/>Justice and prudence must inform your judgment,</l>
<l>That to use all your power may not behove you.</l>
<l>Such, Madam! are my thoughts.</l>

<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Speak yours, Don Manrique!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Though, madam! your discourse schools us to fear,</l>
<l>And inly breeds suspicion in our minds,</l>
<l>Yet, I attest your Right, and own your Power,</l>
<l>To chuse a Husband, and to bid him reign.</l>
<l>Long ere you grac'd a Throne, my soul ador'd you:</l>
<l>The King your Brother, my lamented Master,</l>
<l>Deign'd on my love to smile, and bade me hope.</l>
<l>Fondly my heart the flattering thought has cherish'd,</l>
<l>That four whole years of anxious, constant love,</l>
<l>At last, may win your pity and regard.</l>
<l>Yet if, in this sweet hope, my mind deceive me,</l>
<l>I <hi>swear,</hi> since you demand this test of fealty,</l>
<l>Though to despair you doom my faithful heart,</l>
<l>That <hi>He,</hi> whom your free choice pronounces bless'd,</l>

<l>Remembers, that five years are not elaps'd</l>
<l>Since, as a <hi>Soldier,</hi> in the common ranks,</l>

<l>The Royal Standard of Castile was taken</l>
<l>In the King's sight; your youthful arm redeem'd it.</l>
<l>This perilous action turn'd the tide of battle,</l>
<l>Inspir'd our troops with courage to drive back</l>
<l>The conqu'ring Moors, e'en to their rocky fastness;</l>
<l>Till from the vanquish'd, we became the vanquishers.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>My Lord! I ask you not to word my deeds;</l>
<l>A <hi>Soldier</hi> glories more to act, than vaunt them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Unask'd I speak them; to convince your pride,</l>
<l>I bear no envy to the worth I value.</l>
<l>From chains you sav'd the King in Andalusia:</l>
<l>When pierc'd with wounds, upon a heap of dead,</l>
<l>Your body was so long his shield, his troops</l>
<l>Gain'd time to rally; those foes, who hemm'd him in,</l>
<l>Were sacrific'd; and the same squadron, which went</l>
<l>To rescue him, a victor brought <hi>him</hi> back,</l>
<l>And <hi>you</hi> almost expiring. You mounted first</l>
<l>Upon the walls of Seville, slew Roderigo,</l>
<l>And maintain'd the breach, whilst the Castilians enter'd;</l>
<l>Then, at their head, storm'd the strong citadel,</l>
<l>And forc'd its gates. Of many great exploits</l>
<l>These are but some. Don Lopez and myself,</l>
<l><pb n="161" facs="174"/>To you indebted stand for life and liberty:</l>
<l>For, when surrounded by triumphant Moors,</l>
<l>Then, when we trembled, prisoners to their arms,</l>
<l>By you our Guardian Genius bade them fall,</l>
<l>Fate to our foes, and providence to us;</l>
<l>You conquer'd numbers, to redeem <hi>us</hi> bled.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>My soul rejoic'd to aid the valiant's cause.</l>
<l>'T was but a Soldier's part I did, brave Count!</l>
<l>And, had your fate been mine, yourself or Lopez,</l>
<l>Would have done more, to guard my life or liberty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>To speak your worth is due to my own honour,</l>
<l>Lest I be thought invidious of your glory.</l>
<l>Your rank, and not your courage I dispute;</l>
<l>I think your valour has not had its meed;</l>
<l>The late King promis'd to reward it further,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>I, Carlos! who his crown inherit, take</l>
<l>His debt on me; and amply will repay you.</l>
<l>My Brother held you high in his esteem;</l>
<l>He thought few equal, in his court, to Carlos,</l>
<l>For valour in the field; or in the council,</l>
<l>For wisdom, prudence, and distinguish'd vigour.—</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ.</speaker>

<l>To achieve such deeds, as would become a god:</l>
<l>Let him declare his race and genealogy;</l>
<l>His lineage state; for valour without birth,</l>
<l>Had never right to occupy such place.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>Let him who wills boast honours others earn'd.</l>
<l><hi>I will owe nought to those who gave me life.</hi></l>
<l>I'd rather equal Caesar in the field,</l>
<l>Than trace my lineage to the Julian Race.</l>
<l>What do we know of Macedonia's Kings,</l>
<l>Worthy record, till Philip rose in arms,</l>
<l>And Alexander triumph'd o'er the world.—</l>
<l>Hereditary honours I disdain;</l>
<l>And know, proud Counts! I would not give the name</l>
<l>My sword has earn'd, to be Medina's Duke,</l>
<l>E'en though Don Manrique's blood enrich'd his veins.</l>
<l>I claim no parents, but my past exploits;</l>
<l>My valour be my Race. My arm my Lineage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ.</speaker>
<l>The proof is clear, that Carlos is not Noble.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Then I, whose Son soe'er he be, or what</l>
<l>His Race, <hi>ennoble</hi> him. Contest no more!</l>
</sp>

<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Permit me yet one word—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Not one, Don Manrique</l>
<l>For this audacity assumes too much.</l>
<l>Must I have leave from you to ennoble Carlos?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="163" facs="176"/>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>No!—but that place is due to highest dignities;</l>
<l>And, though ennobled, Carlos cannot take it,</l>
<l>'T is sacred to the High Grandees of Spain;</l>
<l>One less than Count, or Marquis, would profane it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Henceforth then, Carlos! Marquis of Santillane,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Madam! complete your work, and make him King.</l>
<l>To grace him by such dignities, is less</l>
<l>To equal him to us, than to exalt Carlos,</l>
<l>To your own Rank. Your skilful prelude, Princess!</l>

<l>Do not expose their lives to bold adventurers.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ALVAREZ.</speaker>
<l>How can you thus degrade a valiant warrior?</l>
<l>Nay, were he what your hatred has presum'd,</l>
<l>We ought to treat him, as the Queen has rank'd him.</l>

<l>When the Queen braves us, nor regards our blood!</l>

<l>Are Kings accountable for whom they title?</l>

<l>Just as their pleasure wills.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>My Lord! you're politic,</l>
<l>In the respect you pay to majesty:</l>

<l>That, had she dar'd, she would have nam'd him King?</l>
<l>Were not her speeches artful, and mysterious?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ALVAREZ.</speaker>
<l>You show'd such high disdain of valiant Carlos,</l>
<l>And, with such contumacy, brav'd the Queen,</l>
<l>Arraign'd her conduct, and her power disputed,</l>
<l>She was constrain'd to go the lengths she did;</l>
<l>Or yield her dignity, forego her power,</l>
<l>Desert the brave, and side with his high scorners.</l>
<l>You piqued her pride, her sex's niceness wounded;</l>
<l>Your speech indelicate, and haughty carriage,</l>
<l>Were more than Queen, or Woman, ought to bear.</l>
<l>Would you, my Lord! be by your vassal brav'd,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>My Lord! you are a warm apologist:</l>

<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Rank! can it root out passion from my soul,</l>

<l>And let my feelings with my fate agree.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLANCHE.</speaker>
<l>O Madam! how I trembled for your glory;</l>
<l>For, from the Oath you made your lovers swear,</l>
<l>I thought you fix'd to give your Crown to Carlos.</l>
<l>But you have nobly conquer'd your own heart,</l>
<l>Whilst you sustain'd your regal dignity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Say rather, Blanche! that Love usurp'd my throne,</l>
<l>And with a monarch's wrath aveng'd my lover.</l>
<l>I thought that I was master o'er my heart;</l>
<l>I had not plann'd to act, as thou hast seen me,</l>
<l>Although I mean'd to honour Carlos highly:</l>
<l>I only will'd to try the Counts' respect,</l>
<l>And to secure my power, and royal Rights.</l>
<l>For, as, alas! this choice was dreaded by me,</l>
<l>It seem'd like a relief, a sort of pleasure,</l>
<l>To lose a little time, to loiter lingering,</l>
<l>Thus to retard my doom, and put off fate.</l>
<l>Yet I was going to name—I had no choice—</l>
<l>And could Don Manrique have restrain'd his pride,</l>
<l>Castile perhaps, ere this, had hail'd him King.</l>
<l>He urg'd my temper to its utmost bearing;</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Under the specious plea, to avenge my power,</l>
<l>Love found a fair pretence to scatter favours.</l>
<l>I have made Carlos, Marquis, Count, and Governor;</l>
<l>Oh! with what joy could I have hail'd him King!</l>
<l>How my heart pleaded! Yet by these profusions,</l>
<l>I thought to satisfy and silence it;</l>
<l>For to pronounce against him much distress'd me;</l>
<l>And, when I bade him give away my Crown,</l>
<l>'Twas only, that he might himself exclude.</l>
<l>I parley'd with my power to soothe my heart;</l>
<l>And did an outrage, where I seem'd to honour.</l>

<l>Fearing to make him King, you make him more.</l>

<l>He bids the sword decide. Ah! does he hope</l>
<l>To gain me thus himself? Does he then love me?—</l>

<stage>DONNA ELVIRA, DON CARLOS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>Ah! Carlos! scarcely can I call you Marquis,</l>
<l>(Although you merit your exalted rank,</l>
<l>But then I wish'd myself to raise you to it);</l>
<l>Why have the charms of glory, thus seduc'd</l>
<l>Your wavering honour, to desert that cause,</l>
<l>To which your faith was pledg'd, your sword devote?</l>
<l>Your valour should compel the rebel Garcia</l>
<l>To yield obedience to my sovereign sway:</l>
<l>Your sword held ready till I bade it strike,</l>
<l>To place my long-lost sceptre in my hand.</l>
<l>Yet, Count! and with that self-same sword, your faith</l>
<l>To me engag'd, you undertake to fight</l>
<l>Three single combats, which are not for me.</l>
<l>You have forgotten, Count! what Carlos promis'd.</l>
<l>Back to the Queen resign Penafiel,</l>
<l>Burgos, and Santillane. For, trust me, Arragon</l>
<l>Shall grateful give you more than you refuse.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>Either as Carlos, or as Marquis, Madam!</l>
<l>I, nor forget, nor will desert your rights;</l>
<l>The traitor Garcia shall your victim fall.</l>
<l>Yet, though this sacrifice I owe to you,</l>
<l>The Queen, in gratitude, first claims my sword;</l>
<l>And highly it behoves the favour'd Marquis,</l>
<l><pb n="182" facs="195"/>To pay the mighty debt of humble Carlos,</l>
<l>And to resent the outrage done the Queen.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>Did she intrust her ring with that intent?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>When your bright Sex, insulted, wants a champion,</l>
<l>Forbid it honour, glory, courage, manhood,</l>
<l>That they should need to stoop to ask for aid;</l>
<l>Or intimate the means to right their cause.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>I think these combats might have been avoided,</l>
<l>Unless the Counts had challeng'd you in arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>Then had I been ungrateful, and dishonour'd.</l>
<l>Could disrespect assume an air more taunting,</l>
<l>Than to assert, with scornful insolence,</l>
<l>That her high heart indulg'd a secret passion,</l>
<l>Unworthy of herself? Manrique averr'd it;</l>
<l>And infamy would blot my name with cowardice,</l>
<l>Not to stand forth in her most sacred cause,</l>
<l>When duty, honour, gratitude, command it.</l>
<l>My royal Mistress, in protecting me,</l>
<l>Incurr'd this insult by her noble spirit;</l>
<l>Sdeigning submission still the Count defy'd her,</l>
<l>Forcing her new restrictions to invent,</l>
<l>Or tamely shrink, insulted on her throne.</l>
<l>I must protect her rights, assert her power,</l>
<l>Maintain her cause, her injuries avenge;</l>
<l>That done, my sword, with heartfelt zeal, is yours.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="183" facs="196"/>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>Carlos! I comprehend, from this excuse,</l>
<l>That the Queen's service is preferr'd to mine;</l>
<l>Because her subject, you break faith with me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>For her, or you, I feel an equal zeal;</l>
<l>Your cause, or hers, is mine. Nor have I seen</l>
<l>Aught yet, of sleepless toil, or perilous hazard,</l>
<l>But what for either I would wish to encounter.</l>
<l>Nay, though engag'd to fight for her to-morrow,</l>
<l>Sustain'd you wrong, which this day call'd for vengeance,</l>
<l>Instant would I expose my breast, to more</l>
<l>Than Three such combats in your cause, Elvira!</l>
<l>Without reflecting what I ow'd the Queen.</l>
<l>Misconstrue not the conduct which I hold,</l>
<l>Nor wound my soul by undeserv'd reproaches.</l>
<l>Know the high rank to which the Queen has rais'd me,</l>
<l>Has but One charm for Me. But as your champion,</l>
<l>Donna Elvira! are those honours priz'd,</l>
<l>Which, in the eye of undiscerning crowds,</l>
<l>Will give respect to him who fights your battles,</l>
<l>Beyond what unplum'd courage ever meets.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>To grace my cause, I wanted but your valour;</l>
<l>I can invest you with still higher honours,</l>
<l>Them, Marquis! you disdain, and me betray.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>I wish'd but one reward from bright Elvira;</l>
<l>I thought it mine;—but find myself deceiv'd.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>Deceiv'd, my Lord! by whom?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>My own vain thoughts;—</l>
<l>For, from your gentle manners, I presum'd,</l>
<l>That in esteem you held the humble Carlos;</l>
<l>That in your breast such hallow'd friendship dwelt,</l>
<l>As pure Religion, with all-healing balm,</l>
<l>Tells us the blest, in the next world, enjoy;</l>
<l>Where all distinctions cease of earthly rank.</l>
<l>But I was mock'd with visionary joy;</l>
<l>The Queen of Arragon suspects my zeal,</l>
<l>Changes the sweet complacence of her temper,</l>
<l>For dark distrust, anger, and keen reproach.</l>
<l>My mind feels anguish, all unknown before;</l>
<l>A comfortless dismay subdues my spirit;</l>
<l>Joyless, forlorn, and desolate I seem;</l>
<l>As if my Guardian Angel left his charge,</l>

<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>If I be chang'd, your conduct wrought the change:</l>

<l>Your instability excites them all;</l>
<l>Glory allures you to forget your faith,</l>

<l>My friendship brooks not this, nor my esteem.—</l>

<l>That you should pity a poor wretch's fate,</l>

<l><pb n="187" facs="200"/>Embrace the glittering prize which fortune offers;</l>
<l>So much to your advantage is the change,</l>
<l>That it wipes off, that censure, and disgrace,</l>
<l>Which levity and fickleness excite.</l>

<l>How I rejoice to be so much esteem'd,</l>
<l>As to excite your anger, and resentment.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>Count! you mistake the source of my displeasure.</l>
<l>Much it offends me, that you still persist</l>
<l>To persecute my heart, when you forsake me:</l>
<l>And, that you term my coldness cruelty.</l>

<l>I own, with gratitude, your generous services,</l>

<head>SCENE FOURTH.</head>
<stage>DONNA ISABELLA, DON MANRIQUE, DON LOPEZ.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>I will remove all cause of discontent;</l>
<l>And, since my choice more honour will confer,</l>
<l>I will reclaim my Ring; and chuse myself.</l>
<l>But, from my choice, Alvarez I exclude;</l>
<l>Yet, the sole cause of this exclusion, Lords!</l>
<l>Is, that I know he loves the Queen of Arragon.—</l>
<l>In one of you, I view the future King.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE</speaker>
<stage>(<hi>kneeling</hi>).</stage>
<l>O Madam! how your words transport my soul!</l>
<l>E'en whilst I tremble between hope and fear.</l>
<l>If Lopez win you, I shall be less wretched,</l>
<l>Resigning you to such a worthy Lover.</l>
<l>Speak, Madam! my impetuous soul, eager</l>
<l>With hope, demands to know my bliss or woe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Rise!—Ere I speak my choice, fain would I see,</l>
<l>Some certain proof, that 't is myself you love;</l>
<l>And not the splendour of my sovereign Rank.</l>
<l>Counts! I shall think myself most lov'd by him,</l>
<l>Who can my sentiments and thoughts adopt;</l>
<l>Like whom I like, and, whom I hate, despise.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ.</speaker>
<l>Lest we mistake your will, speak plainly, Madam!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="192" facs="205"/>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>If I have liberal been to valiant Carlos,</l>
<l>Let me behold in you a like esteem;</l>
<l>Honour his virtues, do his merit justice.</l>
<l>For ne'er presume, I will a Consort chuse,</l>
<l>To have the King, I make, my work destroy;</l>
<l>Reclaim my favours, or disgrace my friends.</l>
<l>Therefore, let neither hope to share my Throne,</l>
<l>Till something worthy, on your parts, confirms</l>
<l>What I have done for Carlos: that by such act,</l>
<l>I may remain assur'd, the structure which</l>
<l>My gratitude has rear'd, shall not be raz'd:</l>
<l>For I must know it safe, from storm, or stratagem.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Don Carlos, Madam! is most highly honour'd;</l>
<l>His happiness so much employs your thoughts,</l>
<l>Ours is to his inthrall'd: yet since to honour him,</l>
<l>Is to please you, instruct us how to act.—</l>
<l>The Palm of Victory, nor the Trump of Fame,</l>
<l>Ne'er gave renown to one more brave than Carlos.</l>
<l>He is most worthy your munificence;</l>
<l>And well deserves to be, what you have made him.</l>
<l>Our gratitude to him indebted stands,</l>
<l>And we wish'd largely to acknowledge it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ.</speaker>
<l>But after you, we can do nothing for him:</l>
<l>Carlos is rais'd above our power to favour.</l>
<l>What is there in our power, left to propose,</l>
<l>That would not be a degradation to him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="193" facs="206"/>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Gifts, in your power there are, he might accept;</l>
<l>Gifts, that would clear your names from black ingratitude,</l>
<l>And free my anxious mind from its disquiet;</l>
<l>Gifts, which, without disgrace, he might possess.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ.</speaker>
<l>Then name them, Madam! Power, and not will, we lack,</l>
<l>To clear us from this charge of black ingratitude.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Counts! you have each a Sister. 'T is my will,</l>
<l>That He, whom I shall please to chuse for King,</l>
<l>When he receives my hand, at the same Altar,</l>
<l>Shall, to the Warrior Carlos, give his Sister,</l>
<stage>(<hi>The Counts testify by their looks much surprise.</hi>)</stage>
<l>Embrace him, as his Brother, and his Friend;</l>
<l>And thus secure him from my Husband's enmity.</l>
<l>Not that I need to fear his hate to Carlos;</l>
<l>As in Castile I shall be always Queen.</l>
<l>For the new King, whate'er his project be,</l>
<l>Will, though inthron'd, be only my first subject.</l>
<l>But to exert my plenitude of power,</l>
<l>Over the heart to which I gave my own,</l>
<l>Would pain my inmost soul in the extreme.</l>
<l>I urge this union as of strife preventive,</l>
<l>Then answer? Will ye give your full consent?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Yes, Queen! our full consent—to doom us both</l>
<l>To the most cruel death, rather than see,</l>
<l><pb n="194" facs="207"/>The bright, pure honours of a thousand years,</l>
<l>By such a marriage, in one moment tarnish'd.—</l>
<l>Too dear an Empire at a price like this!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Thus then, audacious Count! thus then you testify,</l>
<l>That Carlos is most worthy my munificence;</l>
<l>And well deserves to be, what I have made him.</l>
<l>Thus to except against the Rank I give,</l>
<l>Proud Manrique! is to scorn my sovereign power.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>I do not, Queen! dispute your power to exalt</l>
<l>Carlos, or whom you please, e'en to our Rank.</l>
<l>No Sovereign stands accountable for dignities,</l>
<l>Which he confers, or gifts his liberality</l>
<l>Bestows. If he support, or raise, the unworthy,</l>
<l>'T is his own work, and the shame all his own.</l>
<l>But to disgrace, by misalliance, blood,</l>
<l>Which, from my Ancestors, unsully'd flows,</l>
<l>No Monarch ever shall, by my consent;</l>
<l>First be it on a Public Scaffold spilt,</l>
<l>Rather than know such vile contamination;—</l>
<l>Mine, from inheritance, I owe account of it</l>
<l>To my brave Ancestors, and all Posterity:</l>
<l>Pure, from my great Forefathers I receiv'd it,</l>
<l>Pure, shall it still remain, or cease to flow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Then, Manrique! I, who owe account to no one,</l>
<l>Will of your vaunted, noble blood dispose.</l>
<l>Be mine the shame of its contamination.</l>
<l>What mad extravagance makes you presume</l>
<l><pb n="195" facs="208"/>To think, I should propose, what would dishonour you?</l>
<l>How dare you to suspect me of such turpitude?</l>
<l>What law of rectitude, or nicest honour,</l>
<l>Have I infring'd, throughout my Life, proud Lord?</l>
<l>Or what disgrace incurr'd? I know of none,</l>
<l>But what I now incur—being forc'd to wed,—</l>
<l>Degrading thought,—the Vassal of my Crown;</l>
<l>Who,—whilst I thus descend,—scorns to intrust</l>
<l>His honour to my care.—Say! in what character,</l>
<l>Subject, or Lover, dare you to treat me thus?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ.</speaker>
<l>Pardon the ardour, which infatuates him,</l>
<l>And makes him disrespectful in his speech:</l>
<l>In marriage, both our Sisters are betroth'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>To whom?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>His Sister, Madam! is to me affianc'd.</l>

<l>To Lopez, Madam!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Then I am wrong in making either King.</l>
<l>Go, happy Lovers! go to your chosen Mistresses:</l>
<l>And to enhance the value of your love,</l>
<l>Tell them, with what contemptuous, galling scorn,</l>
<l>You have a Queen insulted, and disdain'd</l>
<l>A throne.—Retire! We hold no further conference.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="196" facs="209"/>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ</speaker>
<stage>(<hi>kneeling</hi>).</stage>
<l>Yet hear us, Madam!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>And what have you to urge?</l>
<l>To speak in praise of constancy in love;</l>
<l>And that no earthly grandeur should seduce it?</l>
<l>If 't is a crime to violate this virtue,</l>
<l>I too, perhaps, my Lords! may learn to practise it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ.</speaker>
<l>Practise it, Madam!—But permit us first</l>
<l>To explain ourselves; that you may fully know</l>
<l>Don Manrique's heart, and mine, where you reign absolute;</l>
<l>As Queen respected, and ador'd as Mistress.—</l>
<l>Your choice will make the one, on whom it falls,</l>
<l>Supremely bless'd, the other doom to woe.</l>
<l>But to prevent all jealous feuds between us,</l>
<l>A mutual promise binds us in one interest.</l>
<l>If he be chosen, then I wed his Sister;</l>
<l>If I obtain you, mine with him unites:</l>
<l>Thus, Carlos cannot to the King be brother.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>And know you not, that, being what you are,</l>
<l>The feudatory Vassals of my State,</l>
<l>Your Sisters are my Subjects, and on me</l>
<l>Depend?—Without my order, and expressly</l>
<l>Against my will, in marriage to engage them,</l>
<l>Is to usurp my Throne, and give <hi>me</hi> law.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Assert your high prerogative as Sovereign,</l>
<l><pb n="197" facs="210"/>Command us, as the Vassals of your State:</l>
<l>Do not <hi>request,</hi> unless we may <hi>refuse.</hi></l>
<l><hi>Command,</hi> we, at our peril, must obey.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ.</speaker>
<l>But, Queen! remember,—never will consent.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>And yet, in deference to your election,</l>
<l>Thus far we will recede, through love and duty;</l>
<l>Carlos is generous and he knows his birth;</l>
<l>Let him in secret judge upon that knowledge.</l>
<l>And, if his blood be worthy of such union,</l>
<l>To us let him this marriage then propose;</l>
<l>And we the alliance shall an honour deem.</l>
<l>He has free choice to wed one of our Sisters;</l>
<l>If, after knowing these strict terms, he dare.</l>
<l>'T is at his peril if his birth be mean.—</l>
<l>Thus far we stoop to gain our royal Mistress.</l>
<l>Modest let Carlos be; or else this marriage,</l>
<l>Must in innumerable evils plunge him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>

<l>Whence this mysterious mutiny in both,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>ACCEPT our joint congratulations, Madam!</l>
<l>That Heaven restores a Son you mourn'd as dead.</l>
<l>For though a Throne and Queen, in beauty's bloom,</l>
<l>Were never yielded, but with strong regret;</l>
<l>Although, to one of us, they both are promis'd,</l>

<l>My Lords! this gen'rous resignation flatters</l>
<l>Too soon my new rais'd hopes—Alas! what hopes?</l>
<l>My princely Son in infancy expir'd:</l>
<l>And this report, excites my grief, and wonder,</l>
<l>Opens the sources of my woes afresh,</l>
<l>Renews my sorrow for my first-born hope,</l>
<l>With all the yearning anguish mothers know,</l>
<l>Who mourn an only Son's untimely death.</l>

<l>His own, his Sister's and his Mother's cause.</l>

<l>Alas! my Lord! He has not been preserv'd.—</l>
<l>Nineteen long years I o'er his tomb have wept.</l>
<l>He cannot be alive—unless some miracle,</l>
<l>From Heaven's high hand, compels the yawning grave</l>
<l>To yield its prey.—All that concerns my Son,</l>
<l>I will relate: then judge, if this report</l>
<l>Have aught, on which a Mother's hope may build.—</l>
<l>I will not trace my troubles to their source:</l>
<l>For Arragon's revolt, and Garcia's usurpation,</l>
<l>From my long biding here, must be well known.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Oft from our Fathers have we heard your woes;</l>
<l>How Ferdinand was from his Kingdom driven;</l>
<l>And you, ere eighteen summers' suns had grac'd</l>
<l>Your brow, were forc'd to seek for shelter here,</l>
<l><pb n="204" facs="217"/>Before the fair Elvira saw the light.</l>
<l>Thus much we know; in what remains instruct us.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Just as Don Ferdinand beheld the Rebel Garcia</l>
<l>Ready to mount his Throne, my Son was born:</l>
<l>Don Sancho was my hapless infant nam'd.</l>
<l>From barbarous Garcia's fury to protect him,</l>
<l>My royal Husband urg'd me to consent</l>
<l>To his conveyance to a safe retreat.</l>
<l>The place where Ferdinand conceal'd my Child.</l>
<l>I never knew.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Had you no clew to trace him,</l>
<l>That so one Day you might reclaim your Son?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>My husband with our Infant tokens sent:</l>
<l>Mine and his Portrait, with a braid of hair,</l>
<l>Pledge of my love, ere yet my bridal day;</l>
<l>And a deed, written by Ferdinand himself,</l>
<l>That own'd and that identify'd our Son.</l>
<l>These in an iron Casket were inclos'd;</l>
<l>Its secret spring known but to him, and me.—</l>
<l>Ah! these precautions prov'd but useless care.</l>
<l>Twelve Moons had scarcely wan'd when my Child dy'd;</l>
<l>Ere I again had clasp'd him to my breast.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ.</speaker>
<l>Perhaps some false report might then deceive you;</l>
<l>We came expecting you could solve our doubts,</l>
<l>And realize the hope and wish of all,</l>
<l><pb n="205" facs="218"/>To find your Son in a most valiant hero.</l>
<l>Fain would I hope this rumour may prove true;</l>
<l>And that your Son still lives to glad your eyes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Oh! 't is impossible! His Father, he himself,</l>
<l>Told the dire tale. He saw my babe expire,—</l>
<l>Catch'd his last breath,—and clos'd his beamless eyes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Would we could doubt the truth of his report!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>A Year of woe, and bloody contest pass'd,</l>
<l>Then Ferdinand rejoin'd his son in death.</l>
<l>Within my arms he died. His last words were,—</l>
<l>"<hi>Don Raymond has in charge, when time shall be,</hi></l>
<l>"<hi>A most important secret for thy ear;</hi></l>
<l>"<hi>Fly to Castile, live for our unborn Infant.</hi>—"</l>
<l>Long did I hope this secret was my Son:</l>
<l>But Raymond never gave me hope it was.</l>
<l>Raymond is lost, and I shall never know it;</l>
<l>Five years are pass'd since he was prisoner made,</l>
<l>By Garcia's spies. I fear they murder'd him;</l>
<l>Too faithful to my cause, brave Raymond perish'd.</l>

<l>Oh, lead me!—let me see him!—</l>

<speaker>D. ALVAREZ.</speaker>
<l>Madam, it is. And Raymond seeks Don Sancho</l>

<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Ah! vain research, Alvarez!</l>
<l>Will you conduct Don Raymond hither to me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ALVAREZ.</speaker>
<l>He to the assembled troops is gone, in hopes</l>
<l>To find Don Sancho midst their Captains.</l>
<l>Don Raymond join'd the Deputies from Arragon,</l>
<l>After their messengers were sent to announce</l>
<l>To you their near approach. Then he declar'd</l>
<l>That their Prince liv'd; that here, he hop'd to find him,</l>
<l>As in the armies of Castile he long has serv'd.—</l>
<l>I will seek Raymond, Madam! but so eagerly,</l>
<l>Do your brave Arragonians press around him,</l>
<l>Their Prince demanding, that I doubt, to bring</l>
<l>Him hither, I must bring the whole wild multitude.</l>

<stage>DONNA LEONORA, DON MANRIQUE, DON LOPEZ.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>As here Don Raymond seeks him, I believe,</l>
<l>Either that Heaven has torn Don Sancho from you,</l>
<l>Or that he lives in the Illustrious Carlos.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="208" facs="221"/>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Carlos, my Lord?—And thinks Don Manrique thus?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ.</speaker>
<l>This is the thought, and wish of a whole People:—</l>
<l>When it was known that here your son was sought,</l>
<l>All with one voice exclaim'd, "He must be Carlos!"</l>
<l>We judg'd that you could have explain'd the mystery.</l>
<l>And therefore sought your presence to explore it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Madam! though envious of Carlos deem'd,</l>
<l>I own that his whole life, since we have known him,</l>
<l>Throughout its wondrous course, appears one miracle:</l>
<l>Himself and fortune almost supernatural.</l>
<l>His high strung virtue that enchants all minds;</l>
<l>His lofty valour, which transcends my praise,</l>
<l>His port majestic and his winning mien,</l>
<l>Give him access, beyond a Subject's reach,</l>
<l>To thrones: Two Queens, all emulous, strive,</l>
<l>Who shall esteem and honour him the most;</l>
<l>Nay, e'en from love, can scarce defend their hearts.</l>
<l>The prompt respect of an adoring People,</l>
<l>Who, like some god, gaze at him as he passes,</l>
<l>All, with resistless evidence, evinces</l>
<l>That valiant Carlos is your long-lost Son.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>In such a Son, how might a Mother triumph?</l>
<l>But yet beware, my Lords! how you inspire</l>
<l>The thought, that Carlos is my long-mourn'd Child;</l>
<l>Lest I mistake a woman's conscious pride,</l>
<l>That would exult to own a Son like him,</l>
<l><pb n="209" facs="222"/>For Nature's sacred voice within my breast.</l>
<l>He has a Prince's spirit, not his birth;</l>
<l>Himself, by his own conduct, this attests,</l>
<l>Leaving the Queen to chuse, amongst her Subjects,</l>
<l>The Partner of her royal bed and Throne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>See you not, Madam! that his princely spirit</l>
<l>Prepares to gain this conquest o'er all three.</l>
<l>Have you forgotten what he said before you?</l>
<l>"<hi>I will owe nought to those who gave me life</hi>"—</l>
<l>Nobly his heart resigns that high advantage,</l>
<l>To owe his greatness only to his courage.</l>

<l>But let my long-lost Son come to my arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>O Queen! I grieve to find this errour spread;</l>
<l>Reserve these transports for your happy Son;</l>
<l>I am not he.—I sought you to complain;</l>
<l>And beg release from an offensive honour.—</l>
<l>The People obstinately bent to take</l>
<l>Away my name, declare I am Don Sancho,</l>
<l>And Prince of Arragon. His presence soon</l>
<l>Will prove how much mistaking they have been,</l>
<l>In thinking me that Prince. I am rais'd up</l>
<l>The phantom of an hour. Such cruel mockery</l>
<l>Abases you, O Queen! as well as Carlos.</l>

<l>Oft is the People's voice the voice of Heaven:</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LOPEZ.</speaker>
<l>My Lord! we know, from well-confirm'd report,</l>
<l>That, in the armies of Castile, Don Sancho serves,</l>
<l>Unknown 't is true, save to himself alone.</l>
<l>Therefore all eyes are fix'd on you, as one,</l>
<l>Whose dazzling merit, speaks exalted Rank.</l>
<l>No longer, Prince! deny what Heaven proclaims.</l>
<l>You have obliged us to transgress against you,</l>
<l>When you should not have forc'd our disrespect.</l>
<l>Our high esteem for Carlos was well known;</l>
<l>Our pride warr'd not with him, but with his birth.</l>
<l>Though Carlos we disdain'd, yet we respect</l>
<l>Don Sancho, will accept him for our Monarch,</l>
<l><pb n="211" facs="224"/>When to our Queen he deigns to own himself.</l>
<l>Quit your disguise, my Lord! and as Don Sancho,</l>
<l>And our chosen King, receive our loyal homage.</l>
</sp>
<stage>(<hi>They take off their hats, and with their right hands upon their hearts, they bow.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>This false respect, with which you have surpris'd me,</l>
<l>Is more injurious, Counts! than your contempt.</l>
<l>I thought this strange report the work of chance;</l>
<l>Not doubting any bold enough to dare,</l>
<l>To make a pageant King of me for sport.</l>
<l>Is this the jest of your exuberant spirits?</l>
<l>Then learn, gay Lords! that the brave honour valour;</l>
<l>And that your equals, in the field, respect,</l>
<l>Nor make of mine a mockery, a may-game.</l>
<l>If this be your intent, first vanquish, then</l>
<l>Deride me; victorious, you may railly me</l>
<l>With grace: Now you anticipate your privilege.</l>
<l>The Queen's Ring still I guard; and this derided</l>
<l>Carlos, his family, and race unknown,</l>
<l>The sceptre of Castile from you withholds.</l>
<l>This arm which from captivity redeem'd you,</l>
<l>May still control, and humble your ambition.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. MANRIQUE.</speaker>
<l>Your speech is that of Monarch, not of Carlos.</l>
<l>Your mien assumes the prince, though you deny it:</l>
<l>We still defend the honour of our rank;</l>
<l>Though prompt to pay what we hop'd due to yours.</l>
<l>Madam! we leave to you to explain this mystery,</l>
<l>A secret charm for Carlos pleads most strongly;</l>
<l><pb n="212" facs="225"/>But you can best develop Nature's voice.</l>

<l>Madam! you see with what contempt they treat me.</l>

<l>Leave this dispute; and speak we of Don Sancho.</l>
<l>These Lords, though proud, yet generously declare,</l>
<l>That in this Court, no Stranger, but yourself,</l>
<l>Has, of a Prince disguis'd, the port and virtues;</l>
<l>That, if Don Sancho live, he lives in you.</l>
<l>Say, are you well acquainted with your birth?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Alas! I am.—Were I some Infant, winds</l>

<l>Expos'd,—through hatred, fear, or cruel shame;</l>
<l>By hazard sound, and from kind pity nurtur'd;</l>
<l>My pride, at this report, would rise to hope,</l>
<l>Beholding you, thus doubtful, thus distress'd.</l>
<l>For I am high of heart and most ambitious.</l>
<l>Sceptres and diadems transport my soul;</l>
<l>And my presumptuous mind impetuous soars</l>
<l><pb n="213" facs="226"/>Beyond all bounds, in useless, idle flights.</l>
<l>Whilst a few warlike deeds sustain vain thoughts;—</l>

<l>—I know my Parents.—I am not Don Sancho.—</l>
<l>He with your Deputies perhaps is come;</l>
<l>And a few hours will bring him to your arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>The Counts have lighted in my mind a hope,</l>
<l>I fain would cherish.—Always I esteem'd you;</l>
<l>A secret movement, in despite of me,</l>
<l>Inclin'd me ever to admire, nay love you.</l>
<l>And something now, intuitively strong,</l>
<l>Within my breast, disowns your words; and says,</l>
<l>You are deceiving me, or else deceiv'd.</l>
<l>What animates me thus I cannot tell;</l>
<l>Whether the ardour of a Mother's love,</l>
<l>Or admiration for transcendent merit;</l>
<l>Whether the sacred voice of Nature speaks,</l>
<l>Or my esteem pays tribute to your worth;</l>
<l>Whether my heart, drawn by mysterious instinct,</l>
<l>Thus owns its blood, or my soul makes a choice.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>Such thoughts as these deceive their followers,</l>
<l>As the night-meteor travellers misleads;</l>
<l>They are delusions all. Then, Queen! resist them.</l>
<l>If the least gleam of dawning hope could rise</l>
<l>Within my breast, that I your Son could be,</l>
<l>Think with what towering joy, what exultation,</l>
<l>I, at your feet, should fall, and claim your love.</l>
<l><pb n="214" facs="227"/>The lofty pride of my aspiring mind,</l>
<l>Would glory to be Master of a Throne;</l>
<l>But, with a dearer triumph would rejoice</l>
<l>In such a Mother; whose exalted rank,</l>
<l>Is less conspicuous than her long-try'd virtues.</l>
<l>Again,—with solemn truth,—I re-assure you—</l>
<l>I know my Parents:—I am not Don Sancho.</l>
</sp>

<l>And this report, so widely spread, so eagerly</l>

<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Who told thee this?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLANCHE.</speaker>
<l>I saw their meeting, Madam!</l>
<l>And all the court is witness to the fact.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>I scarcely know to credit thy report.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>Ah! fortune, how unjust!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Unjust indeed!</l>
<l>Is this great soul and virtue so sublime,</l>
<l>Sprung from a beggar's race?—What then is blood?</l>
<l>If Carlos, He, whose high, heroic worth</l>
<l>Deserves the Throne, his prowess oft has guarded,</l>
<l>Was in a cottage born, from shepherd parents?</l>
<l><pb n="228" facs="241"/>Has Manrique's blood, or my own royal stream,</l>
<l>E'er form'd a hero that transcends this Carlos?</l>
<l>And, though he sprung in an ungenial soil,</l>
<l>His vigorous soul throve midst its scanty nurture,</l>
<l>And pair'd with princes nurs'd by fortune's hand.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>And must this true-born Eagle be disdain'd,</l>
<l>Because his aërie was not plac'd on high?</l>
<l>Men should take rank, not from their birth, but virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>But how did Carlos bear this sad reverse?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLANCHE.</speaker>
<l>Oh! with deep anguish, and exalted courage.</l>
<l>Along the audience-hall he graceful walk'd,</l>
<l>And, ever and anon, with courteous speech,</l>
<l>Check'd the false rumour, as he pass'd the crowd:</l>
<l>But all your court was bent to change his name;</l>
<l>And murmur'd round, "Don Sancho, Prince of Arragon."</l>
<l>When a poor, mean, old, man, in shepherd's garb,</l>
<l>Burst through your guards, and clasp'd him in his arms.</l>
<l>"Why didst thou leave me in my age?" he cried.</l>
<l>Carlos turn'd pale; then blush'd from pride and shame.</l>
<l>But duty triumph'd, and the hero wept;</l>
<l>He clasp'd his aged Parent to his breast;</l>
<l>And "O my Father!" "O my long-lost Son!"</l>
<l>Echo'd responsive, midst their sighs and tears.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>Disdainful of his birth, he loves his Sire;</l>
<l>Nature and Virtue, rule his noble soul.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="229" facs="242"/>
<speaker>BLANCHE.</speaker>
<l>Though strange to tell, these cries of grief and joy</l>
<l>Were disbeliev'd. The court around them gather'd,</l>
<l>And this poor, peasant Shepherd, spite of Carlos,</l>
<l>Is deem'd dishonest, torn from his arms,</l>
<l>And roughly treated. 'T is a cheat they cry,</l>
<l>A dark impostor, by the Counts suborn'd,</l>
<l>To throw disgrace on Carlos, and excuse</l>
<l>Their proud refusal of the proffer'd combat.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ELVIRA.</speaker>
<l>'T is surely so!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. ISABELLA.</speaker>
<l>We must examine this;</l>
<l>And, if the Counts be guilty, they shall find,</l>
<l>Such malice sins beyond a Prince's mercy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLANCHE.</speaker>
<l>The Counts themselves deserve your admiration;</l>
<l>With pains this incredulity they strengthen,</l>
<l>And generously attest the whole a cheat.</l>
<l>Not, Madam! that they take this mean, low malice</l>
<l>Upon themselves; but they declare, that one</l>
<l>Of their domestics is the guilty author;</l>
<l>Who, hoping thus to please them, has instructed</l>
<l>This poor, mean wretch, how to affront brave Carlos.</l>
<l>Each, with avidity, believes this tale;</l>
<l>The Counts, to gain more credence to their story,</l>
<l>Have caus'd this aged man to be imprison'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>What must we think of this?</l>

<l>In vain does Carlos</l>
<l>Witness against himself; no one believes him,</l>

<l>With anger, loudly claims his Father's liberty.</l>

<l>My aged Father from my arms is torn,</l>

<l>He is to prison led for this injustice.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>I am this Shepherd's Son. He is no cheat,</l>
<l>No infamous impostor; though mean of blood,</l>
<l><pb n="231" facs="244"/>He is not vile of soul. And I renounce</l>
<l>More willingly, the names of Count and Marquis,</l>
<l>Than a Son's sentiments of love and duty.</l>
<l>Nought can efface the sacred character</l>
<l>Of Nature's ties, within an honest breast.</l>
<l>I left my parents, I disclaim'd my name:</l>
<l>My soul for honour sigh'd, for glory panted,</l>
<l>E'en in that cottage where my fate had cast me.</l>
<l>Your courtly maxims warr'd against my hopes;</l>
<l>The road of Honour, and the course of Glory,</l>
<l>Were open but to Lords. I had no means</l>
<l>To rise, but to conceal my birth. I learn'd</l>
<l>To blush at what, in other courts, would be</l>
<l>My praise,—That in five years a peasant youth</l>
<l>Rose from the Ranks, distinguished by his Sword,</l>

<l>Madam! command that they should free my Father.</l>

<l>We cannot bear that this exalted Carlos,</l>
<l>Beneath whose arm the Moors so oft have trembled,</l>

<l>Should, from his birth, receive a stain indelible.</l>
<l>A higher rank his godlike valour merits,</l>
<l><pb n="232" facs="245"/>Than custom gives to such ignoble blood.</l>
<l>I now must own such custom is unwise,</l>
<l>Alike impolitic, unjust, and cruel.</l>
<l>The man, whose deeds merit a princely rank,</l>
<l>Though in a cottage born, that rank should grace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>How am I fallen! If I excite your pity!—</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. CARLOS.</speaker>
<l>Since known to you, I care not, Lords! who knows it.</l>
<l>Who tells the meanness of my birth, must tell,</l>
<l>That Sancho, a poor, honest peasant's Son,</l>
<l>From bondage sav'd two Counts: and lately held</l>
<l>In tribulation two illustrious rivals</l>
<l>On their Queen's choice. Sancho, a peasant's Son,</l>
<l>Holds in his hand the power to seat a Sovereign</l>
<l>Upon that Throne, his arm has propp'd, his sword</l>
<l>Has twice redeem'd.—Spite of himself, this Sancho,</l>
<l>Though but a shepherd's Son, was thought a Prince.</l>
<l>Hence learn what mind and courage can achieve,</l>
<l>And contemplate the building they have rear'd.—</l>
<l>That want of birth must raze this goodly fabric,</l>
<l>Is an unwholesome maxim in the state,</l>
<l>Which saps its vigour, and enslaves its people.</l>
<l>Virtue or in the Peasant or the Prince,</l>
<l>Should meet the same impartial, just reward.</l>
<l>Yet, notwithstanding this unjust disgrace,</l>
<l>All noble minds will value me the more,</l>

<speaker>D. ALVAREZ.</speaker>
<l>Nor prayers, nor bribe can win this wretched Shepherd,</l>
<l>To aid in our design. I strove in vain,</l>
<l>By every argument, to make him feel</l>
<l>How irksome his ungracious presence was.</l>
<l>That he disgrac'd a generous, valiant Son,</l>
<l>Ruin'd his fortune, stigmatiz'd his honour:</l>
<l>That if he lov'd him, he must now declare,</l>
<l>'T was a mean trick he had been brib'd to play him.</l>
<l>To all the reasons I could urge, I added menaces—</l>

<l>My Father's virtue has withstood them all?—</l>

<sp>
<speaker>D. ALVAREZ.</speaker>
<l>Unshaken, unseduc'd—He claims his Son—</l>
<l>And for his loss of fortune, or of honour,</l>
<l>He says that he can make him a great Lord.</l>
<l>Simple and credulous he this believes;</l>
<l>Because his wife a hundred times has told him,</l>
<l>That at the sight of a poor paltry token,</l>
<l>The Queen of Arragon will Carlos aggrandize.</l>
<l>I, won by the old man's tears, and earnest prayers.</l>
<l>Present this homely pledge, this Iron Casket.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Oh! welcome, Raymond! Hast thou found my Son?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>I hope he lives; yet, where he is I know not.</l>
<l>For from five years of bondage just releas'd,</l>
<l>I've vainly sought him, where, by the late King's order,</l>
<l>I with such happy secrecy had plac'd him.</l>
<l>His foster Father thought him his own Son;</l>
<l><pb n="240" facs="253"/>For, being absent when a dead child was born,</l>
<l>Your living Son was by his wife receiv'd;</l>
<l>And with kind care was nurtur'd as her own.</l>
<l>A Priest, by me intrusted, form'd his mind,</l>
<l>As 't were through friendly charity and love:</l>
<l>And from this pious Pastor have I learn'd</l>
<l>That your Son fled, at Sixteen years of age,</l>
<l>As he imagin'd, bent to follow arms,</l>
<l>From which no prayers could win his princely soul.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. LEONORA.</speaker>
<l>But whither went he, Raymond! Can they tell?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>Large sums of gold were oft mysteriously</l>
<l>From him receiv'd; but no trace given to find him.</l>
<l>Anxious, uncertain of his fate, five years</l>
<l>Did his false parents mourn. When by a neighbour,</l>
<l>Just from Castile return'd, they were inform'd,</l>
<l>That he had seen their son, but in such glory,</l>
<l>And credit, at this Court, that his heart fail'd him,</l>
<l>He neither dar'd accost him, nor declare,</l>
<l>That he had known him once a cottage resident.</l>
<l>The Sire, with joy transported, at such news,</l>
<l>Set out to seek this boasted Son, two days</l>
<l>Before I reach'd his dwelling, where I thought</l>
<l>To find Don Sancho safe. Hither I bent</l>
<l>My course, o'ertook the Deputies from Arragon,</l>
<l>And told all this to them. In vain I seek</l>
<l>To trace this Peasant, or to find your Son.</l>
