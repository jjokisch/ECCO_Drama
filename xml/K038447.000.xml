<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>HAVING been, for some time, a labourer in the Drama, and finding it necessary to continue my labours, I cannot help endeavouring to guard the past from misrepresentation, lest my supineness may injure the future. Conscious that a prejudice has been created against the Play which I now submit to the Reader, and conscious how far I am innocent of raising it, it were stupid to sit down in silence, and thus tacitly acknowledge myself guilty of dulness;— dumbly confess I have been deficient in the knowledge of my trade, damn myself for a bungling workman, and fix a disrepute upon every article which may, hereafter, come from my hands.</p>
<p>Thanks to you, Ladies and Gentlemen! you have been kind customers to me; and I am proud to say that you have stamped a fashion upon my goods. Base, indeed, and ungrateful were the attempt, after your favours, so long received and continued, to impose upon you
<pb n="iv" facs="3"/>
a clumsy commodity, and boast it to be ware of the best quality that I ever put up to sale! No— on the word of an honest man, I have bestowed no small pains upon this <hi>Iron Chest,</hi> which I offer you. Inspect it; examine it; you see the maker's name is upon it. I do not say it is perfect; I do not pretend to tell you it is of the highest polish; there is no occasion for that:— many of my brethren have presented you with mere <hi>linings for chests,</hi> and you have been content:—but, I trust, you will find that my <hi>Iron Chest</hi> will hold together, that it is tolerably sound, and fit for all the purposes for which it was intended.</p>
<p>Then how came it to fall to pieces, after four days wear?—I will explain that:—but alas! alas! my heart doth yearn, when I think on the task which circumstance has thrust upon me.</p>
<p>Now, by the Spirit of Peace, I Swear! were I not doomed to explore the rugged windings of the Drama, I would wrap myself in mute philosophy, and repose calmly under the dark shade of my grievance, rather than endure the pain, and trouble, of this explanation.— I cannot, however, cry "Let the world slide:" I must pursue my journey; and be active to clear away the obstacles that impede my progress.</p>
<p>I am too callous, now, to be annoyed by those innumerable gnats and insects, who daily dart their impotent stings on the literary traveller; and too knowing to dismount, and waste my time in whipping grasshoppers:—but here is a scowling, sullen, black Bull, right athwart my road;—a monster of magnitude, of the Boeotian breed, perplexing me in my wanderings through the entangled labyrinth of Drury!
<pb n="v" facs="4"/>
he stands sulkily before me, with sides, seemingly impenetrable to any lash, and tougher than the Dun Cow of Warwick!—His front out-fronting the brazen bull of Perillus!—He has bellowed, Gentlemen! Yea, he hath bellowed a dismal sound! A hollow, unvaried tone, heaved from his very midriff, and striking the listener with torpor!—Would I could pass the animal quietly, for my own sake!—and, for his, by Jupiter! I repeat it, I would not willingly harm the Bull.—I delight not in baiting him.—I would jog as gently by him as by the ass that grazes on the common: but he has obstinately blocked up my way—he has already tossed and gored me, severely—I must make an effort, or he batters me down, and leaves me to bite the dust.</p>
<p>The weapon I must use is not of that brilliant, and keen quality, which, in a skilful hand, neatly cuts up the subject, to the delight, and admiration, of the bye-standers: It is a homely cudgel of Narrative; a blunt batoon of Matter of fact; affording little display of art in the wielder; and so heavy in its nature, that it can merely claim the merit of being appropriate to the opponent at whom it is levelled.</p>
<p>Pray, stand clear!—for I shall handle this club vilely: and if any one come in my way, he may chance to get a rap, which I did not intend to bestow upon him. Good venal and venomous gentlemen, who dabble in ink for pay or from pique, and who have dubbed yourselves <hi>Criticks,</hi> keep your distance now! Run home to your garrets!—Fools! ye are but <hi>Ephemera</hi> at best; and will die soon enough, in the paltry course of your insignificant natures, without thrusting
<pb n="vi" facs="5"/>
your ears (if there be any left you) into the heat of this perilous action.—A vaunt!—well, well, stay if ye are bent upon it, and be pert and busy;—your folly, to me, is of no moment.<note n="*" place="foot">Ye who impartially, and conscientiously, sit in diurnal judgment upon modern dramatists, apply not this to yourselves. It aims only at the malevolent, the mean, and the ignorant, who are the disgrace of your order.</note></p>
<p>I hasten now to my Narrative.</p>
<p>I agreed to write the following Play, at the instance of the chief Proprietor of Drury-Lane Theatre; who, unconditionally, agreed to pay me a certain sum for my labour:—and this certain sum, being much larger than any, I believe, hitherto offered on similar occasions, created no small jealousy among the Parnassian <hi>Sans Culottes</hi>; several of whom have, of late, been vapidly industrious to level, to the muddy surface of their own Castalian ditch, so <hi>Aristocratico-Dramatick</hi> a bargainer. The Play, as fast as written, (piecemeal) was put into rehearsal: But let it here be noted, gentle reader! that a rehearsal, in Drury-Lane, (I mean as far as relates to this Iron Chest) is <hi>lucus à</hi> non <hi>lucendo.</hi> They yclep it a rehearsal, I conjecture, because <hi>they do</hi> NOT <hi>rehearse.</hi> I call the loved shade of Garrick to witness; nay, I call the less loved presence of the <hi>then</hi> acting Manager to avow,—that there never was one fair rehearsal of the Play.—Never one rehearsal, wherein one, or two, or more, of the Performers, very essential to the piece, were not absent: and <hi>all</hi> the rehearsals which I attended, so slovenly, and irregular, that the ragged master of a theatrical Barn, might have blushed for
<pb n="vii" facs="6"/>
the want of discipline in the pompous Director of His Majesty's Servants, at the vast and astonishing new-erected Theatre-Royal, in Drury-Lane.</p>
<p>It is well known, to those conversant with the business of the stage, that no perfect judgment can be formed of the length of a Play, apparent to the spectator, nor of the general <hi>effect</hi> intended to be produced, until the private repetitions, among the actors, have reduced the business into something like <hi>lucidus ordo:</hi>— then comes the time for the judicious author to take up his pruning-knife, or handle his hatchet. Then he goes lustily to work, my masters! upon his curtailments, or additions; his transpositions, his loppings, his parings, trimmings, dockings, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. As in the writing, so in the rehearsal.</p>
<l>"Ordinis haec virtus erit et venus, aut ego fallor;"</l>
<l>"Ut jam nunc dicat, jam nunc debentia dici"</l>
<l>"Pleraque differat, et praesens in tempus omittat:"</l>
<l>"Hoc amet, hoc spernat, promissi carminis Auctor."</l>
<p>But, woe is me! while I was patiently waiting the expected crisis, a circumstance occurred which compelled me to watch a crisis of a less agreeable nature. A fever attacked me, as I sat beneath the damp dome of Drury, and drove me, <hi>malgrè moi,</hi> to bed; where I lay during a week, till three hours before the Play was exhibited. In addition to the unavoidable injury arising from the author's absence, Mr. KEMBLE, the acting-manager, and principal performer in the piece, was, and had been for a few days, previous to my own illness, confined
<pb n="viii" facs="7"/>
to his chamber, by indisposition. I lay little stress, indeed, upon his temporary incapacity to perform his managerical duty; his mode of discharging it, hitherto, was productive of little benefit to me;—Still it was <hi>some</hi> drawback— for were a mere Log thrown amidst a Thespian community, and nominated its dull and ponderous Ruler, still the block, while in its place, would carry some sway with it:—but his non-attendance as an actor, so much engaged in the Play, was particularly detrimental.</p>
<p>Nay, even the Composer of the musick— and here let me breathe a sigh to the memory of departed worth and genius, as I write the name of STORAGE—even he, could not preside in his department. He was preparing an early flight to that abode of harmony, where choirs of Angels swell the note of welcome to an honest, and congenial spirit.</p>
<p>Here then was a direct stop to the business? No such thing. The Troops proceeded without leaders: In the dark, <hi>Messieur.!—"Sans</hi> eyes, <hi>Sans</hi> every thing." The Prompter, it is true, a kind of non-commissioned officer, headed the Corps, and a curious march was made of it!</p>
<p>But, lo! two days, or three, (I forget which) previous to the public representation, up rose King KEMBLE! like Somnus from his ebon bed, to distribute his dozing directions among his subjects.</p>
<l>"Tardâ gravitate jacentes"</l>
<l>"Vix oculus tollens;"</l>
<l>"Summaque percutiens nutanti pictora mento,"</l>
<l>"Excussit, tandem, sibi se; cubitoque levatus," &amp;c.</l>
<p><pb n="ix" facs="8"/>He came, saw, and pronounced the Piece to be ripe for exhibition. It was ordered to be performed immediately. News was brought to me, in my sickness, of the mighty <hi>Fiat</hi>; and, although I was told, officially, that due care had been taken to render it worthy of public attention, I submitted with doubt and trembling to the decree. My doubts, too, of this boasted care, were not a little increased by a note, which I received from the Prompter, written by the Manager's order, <hi>three hours only,</hi> before the first representation of the Play:—wherein, at this late period, my consent was, abruptly, requested to a transposition of two of the most material scenes in the second act: and the reason given for this curious proposal was, that the present stage of Drury—where the Architect and Machinist, with the judgment and ingenuity of a Politician and a Wit to assist them, had combined to outdo all former theatrical outdoings—was so bunglingly constructed, that there was not time for the carpenters to place the lumbering frame-work, on which an Abbey was painted, behind the representation of a Library, without having a chasm of ten minutes in the action of the Play; and that in the middle of an act.—Such was the fabrication of that New Stage, whose <hi>"extent</hi> and <hi>powers"</hi> have been so vauntingly advertised, under the classick management of Mr. KEMBLE, in the edifying exhibition of Pantomimes, Processions, Pageants, Triumphal Cars, Milk white Horses, and Elephants!</p>
<p>As I did not chuse to alter the construction of my Play, without deliberation, merely to skreen the ill-construction of the House, I would
<pb n="x" facs="9"/>
not listen to the modest, and <hi>well timed</hi> demand, of turning the progress of my fable <hi>topsy turvy.</hi></p>
<p>Very ill, and very weak, from the effects of the fever, which had not, yet, left me, I made an effort, and went to the Theatre, to witness the performance. I found Mr. KEMBLE, in his dressing-room, a short time before the curtain was drawn up, taking <hi>Opium Pills:</hi> and, nobody who is acquainted with that gentleman will doubt me when I assert, that, they are a medicine which he has long been in the habit of swallowing. He appeared to me very unwell; and seemed, indeed, to have imbibed,
<l>"Poppy and Mandragora,"</l>
<l>"And all the drowsy syrups of the world."</l></p>
<p>The Play began; and all went smoothly, till a trifling disapprobation was shewn to the character personated by Mr. DODD;—the scene in which he was engaged being much <hi>too long:</hi> A proof of the neglect of those whose business it was to have informed me (in my unavoidable absence from the Theatre) that it appeared in the <hi>last rehearsals,</hi> to want curtailment. I considered this, however, to be of no great moment; for Mr. KEMBLE was to appear immediately in a subsequent scene, and much was expected from his execution of a part, written expressly for his powers.</p>
<p>And, here, let me describe the requisites for the character which I have attempted to draw, that the world may judge whether I have taken a wrong measure of the personage whom I proposed to fit: premising that I have worked for him before, with success, and, therefore, it
<pb n="xi" facs="10"/>
may be presumed that I am somewhat acquainted with the dimensions of his qualifications.— I required, then, a man
<l>"Of a tall stature, and of sable hue,"</l>
<l>"Much like the son of Kish, that lofty Jew."</l>
A man of whom it might be said,
<l>"There's something in his soul"</l>
<l>"O'er which his melancholy sits, and broods."</l></p>
<p>Look at the actor;—and will any body do him the injustice to declare that he is deficient in these qualifications? It would puzzle any author, in any time or country, from Aeschylus down, even, to the Translator of <hi>Lodoiska</hi>—and really, gentlemen, I can go no lower—to find a figure and face better suited to the purpose. I have endeavour'd, more-over, to pourtray <hi>Sir Edward Mortimer</hi> as a man stately in his deportment, reserved in his temper, mysterious, cold, and impenetrable, in his manner: and the candid observers, I trust, will allow that Mr. KEMBLE is thouroughly adequate to such a personation.</p>
<p>To complete my requisitions, I demanded a performer who could enter into the spirit of a character proceeding upon romantic, half-witted principles, abstracted in his opinions, sophisticated in his reasonings, and who is thrown into situations where his mind and conduct stand, tiptoe, on the extremest verge of probability. Here, surely, I have not mistaken my man; for if I am able to form any opinion of him, as an Actor,—and my opinion, I know, is far from
<pb n="xii" facs="11"/>
singular,—his chief excellence almost approaches that style which the learned denominate <hi>Caricature.</hi> Possibility on the stretch, passion over-leaping it's customary bound, movements of the soul, sullen, or violent, very rarely seen in the common course of things, yet still <hi>may</hi> be seen —in these is his element. As our language is said to have sunk under the vast conception of MILTON, so does the modesty of nature suffer a depression beneath the unwieldy imaginings of Mr. KEMBLE. He seldom deigns to accompany the Goddess in her ordinary walks; when she decently paces the regular path, with a sober step, and a straight person: but he kindly assists her when she is, doubtless, in need of assistance —when she appears out of her way, crazy and crooked.</p>
<p>The arrogant fault of being more refined than Refinement, more proper than Propriety, more sensible than Sense, which, nine times in ten, will disgust the spectator, becomes frequently, an advantage to him, in characters of the above description.</p>
<p>In short, Mr KEMELE is a paragon-representative of the <hi>Lusus Naturae:</hi> and were Mr. KEMBLE sewed up in a skin, to act a hog in a pantomime, he would act a hog with six legs better than a hog with four.</p>
<p>If any one ask why I chose to sketch a <hi>Lusus Naturae</hi> when it might better become an author to be chaste in his delineation, I can only reply that, I did so to obtain the assistance of Mr. KEMBLE in his best manner; and that now, I do most heartily repent me: for never, sure, did man place the main strength of his building upon so rotten a prop!</p>
<p><pb n="xiii" facs="12"/>Well, the great actor was discovered, as <hi>Sir Edward Mortimer,</hi> in his library. Gloom and desolation sat upon his brow; and he was habited, from the wig to the shoe-string, with the most studied exactness. Had one of King CHARLES the First's portraits walked from its frame, upon the boards of the Theatre, it could not have afforded a truer representation of ancient and melancholy dignity.</p>
<p>The picture could not have looked better— but, in justice to the picture, it must also be added, that, the picture could scarcely have acted worse.</p>
<p>The spectators, who gaped with expectation at his first appearance, yawned with lassitude before his first <hi>exit.</hi> It seemed, however, that illness had totally incapacitated him from performing the business he had undertaken. For his mere illness he was entitled to pity; for his conduct under it, he, undoubtedly, deserved censure.</p>
<p>How can Mr. KEMBLE, as a Manager, and an Actor, justify his thrusting himself forward in a new Play, the material interest of which rested upon his own powers, at a moment when he must be conscious that he had no powers at all?—Mr. KEMELE owes a duty to the publick, to his employer, and to an author writing for his employer's house. How does he treat the claimants upon his service, in this instance? Exactly, thus—he insults the understanding of the first, and injures the interests of the two last, by calling in a crowd to an entertainment which he knows he must mar.</p>
<p>I requested him, at the end of the first act, to order an apology to be made for his indisposition,
<pb n="xiv" facs="13"/>
lest the uninformed or malicious, might attribute the ponderosity of the performer to the heaviness of the author. I was anxious to disavow all right and title to those pigs of lead which did not belong to me, and of which Mr. KEMBLE was the just proprietor. But no—he peremptorily declared he would not suffer an apology to be made! It should have been made (if at all) before the play began.—Then why was it not made?—He did not, <hi>then,</hi> imagine that illness would have disabled him.—So, then, a man quits his chamber, after an attack which has, evidently, weakened him extremely, and he has no bodily feel, no internal monitor, to whisper to him that he is feeble, and that he has not recovered sufficient strength to make a violent exertion!—This mode of reasoning, adopted by Mr. KEMBLE, is much in the spirit of that clown's, who did not know whether he could play on the fiddle 'till he tried. Be it noted, also, that Mr. KEMBLE was swallowing his opium pills, <hi>before</hi> the play began, <hi>because he was ill:</hi>—but opium causes strange oblivious effects; and these pills must have occasioned so sudden a lapse in Mr. KEMBLE's memory, that he forgot when he took them, why he took them, or that he had taken them at all.—The dose must have been very powerful.—Still, for the reasons already stated, I pressed for an apology; still Mr. KEMBLE continued obstinate in opposing it. His indisposition, he said, was evident; he had coughed very much upon the stage, and an apology would make him <hi>"look like a fool.."</hi></p>
<p>Good-nature in excess becomes weakness; but I never yet found, in the confined course of
<pb n="xv" facs="14"/>
my reading, that good-nature and folly would bear the same definition: Mr. KEMBLE, it should seem (and he produced, at least, managerical <hi>authority</hi> for it) considered the terms to be synonimous. Freely, however, forgiving him for his unkindness, in refusing to gratify a poor devil of an author,—who, very anxious for his reputation, was very moderate in his request—I do, in all christian charity, most sincerely wish that Mr. KEMBLE may never find greater cause to <hi>look like a fool</hi> than an apology for his indisposition.</p>
<p>At length, by dint of perseverance, I gained my point. A proprietor of the Theatre was called in upon the occasion, whose mediation in my favour carried more weight with the Acting Manager than a hapless Dramatist's entreaty; and the apology was, in due form, delivered to the audience.</p>
<p>One third of the Play, only, was yet performed; and I was, now, to make up my mind, like an unfortunate traveller, to pursue my painful journey, through two stages more, upon a broken-down Poster, car whose back lay all the baggage for my expedition. Miserably, and most heavily in hand, did the Poster proceed!—He groaned, he lagged, he coughed, he winced, he weezed!—Never was seen so sorry a jade! The audience grew completely soured, and, once completely soured, every thing, naturally, went wrong. They recurred to their disapprobation of poor DODD—and observe what this produced. I must relate it.</p>
<p>Mr. KEMBLE had just plodded through a scene, regardless of those loud and manifest tokens that the Criticks delight not in the
<pb n="xvi" facs="15"/>
<hi>"drowsy hums"</hi> with which he <hi>rang night's "yawning peal,"</hi> when DODD appeared to him on the Stage; at whose entrance the clamour was renewed. Then, and <hi>not till then,</hi> did the Acting Manager, who had been deaf as any post to the supplications of the author for an apology—then did he appear suddenly seized with a fit of good nature. He voluntarily came forward <hi>"to look like a fool,"</hi> and beg the indulgence of the town. He feared he was the unhappy cause of their disapprobation; he entreated their patience, and hoped he should shortly gain strength, to enable them to judge, on a future night, what he handsomely termed the <hi>merits</hi> of the Play. Here was friendship! Here was adroitness! While the Publick were testifying their disgust at the Piece, through the medium of poor DODD, Mr. KEMBLE, with unexampled generosity, took the whole blame upon his own shoulders, and heroically saved the author, by so timely an interposition. I was charmed with this master-stroke, and, at the impulse of the moment, I thanked him. But, alas! how narrow is the soul of man! how distrustful in its movements, how scanty in its acknowledgments, how perplexing to itself in its combinations! Had I, afterwards, looked on the thing simply and nakedly, by itself, why the thing is a good-natured thing: but I must be putting other circumstances by the side of it, with a plague to me! I must be puzzling myself to see if all fits; if all is of a piece. And what is the result?—Miserable that I am! I have lost the pleasure of evincing a gratitude, which I thought I owed, because I no longer feel myself a debtor. Had I abandoned my mind
<pb n="xvii" facs="16"/>
to that placid negligence, that luxurious confidence, which the inconsiderate enjoy, it had never occurred to me that Mr. KEMBLE, foreseeing, perhaps, that an aggrieved author might not be totally silent—steped forward with this speech to the publick, as a kind of <hi>salvo,</hi> (should a statement be made) for his rigidity in the first instance. It had never occurred to me that Mr. KEMBLE was sufficiently hissed, yawned at, laughed at, and coughed down, to have made his apology <hi>before</hi> Mr. DODD appeared: It had never occurred to me that his making his apology at a previous moment would have answered the same purpose to <hi>me,</hi> and not to <hi>him:</hi> It had never occurred, in short, that there is such a thing as ostentatious humility, and a politick act of kindness; and that I should have waited the sequel of a man's conduct, before I thanked him for one instance of seeming good will, close upon the heels of stubborn ill-nature, and in the midst of existing, and palpable injury. The sequel will shew that I was premature in my acknowledgment—but before I come to the sequel, a word or two (I will be brief) to close my account of this, the first night's, eventful history. The Piece was concluded, and <hi>given out,</hi> for a second performance with much opposition.</p>
<p>Friends, who never heard the Play read, shook their heads; Friends, who <hi>had</hi> heard it read, scarcely knew it again: Several, I doubt not, of the impartial, who chose to be active, actively condemned; and enemies, of course, rejoiced in an opportunity of joining them.</p>
<p>No opportunity could be fairer. The Play was, at least, a full hour too long; and had
<pb n="xviii" facs="17"/>
<hi>Job</hi> himself sat to hear it he must have lost his patience. But, if, gentle reader, thou possessest <hi>Job's</hi> quality, and hast followed me thus far, in my Narrative, it will appear to thee (for I doubt not thy retention and combination) that I was unable to curtail it effectually, at the proper time—the last rehearsals. I was, then, laid flat, my dear friend, as you remember I have told you, by a fever. The Acting Manager did attend the last rehearsals, and suffered the piece to be produced, <hi>uncut,</hi> to "drag its slow length along" surcharged with all his own incapacity, and all his opium.</p>
<p>How, then, do I stand indebted, according to the articles of this night's statement? I owe to Mr. KEMBLE,
<list>
<item><hi>For his illness,</hi> COMPASSION,</item>
<item><hi>For his conduct under it,</hi> CENSURE,</item>
<item><hi>For his refusing to make an apology,</hi> A SMILE!</item>
<item><hi>For his making an apology,</hi> A SNEER,</item>
<item><hi>For his mismanagement,</hi> A GROAN,</item>
<item><hi>For his acting,</hi> A HISS.</item>
</list></p>
<p>This account is somewhat like the Tavern bill, picked from Falstaff's pocket, when he is snorting behind the arras. There is but one halfpenny worth of compassion to this intolerable deal of blame.</p>
<p>Now for the sequel.—I have shewn, I think, that Mr. KEMBLE, in the first instance, undertook a duty which he <hi>could</hi> not perform: I have now to affirm, with all the difficulty of proving a negative full in my face, that he afterwards, made a mockery of discharging a duty which he <hi>would</hi> not perform.</p>
<p><pb n="xix" facs="18"/>After a week's interval, to give him time to recruit his strength; and the Author time to curtail, and alter, the Play; (for the impression which the Mis-Manager and Actor, had contrived to stamp rendered alteration necessary) it was a second time represented.</p>
<p>I must, here, let the uninformed reader into a secret;—but I must go to Newmarket to make him understand me.—No, Epsom will do as well; and that is nearer home.—It often happens, at a Race, that a known Horse, from whom good sport is expected, disappoints the crowd by <hi>walking over the course.</hi>—He does not miss an inch of the ground; but affords not one jot of diversion, unless some pleasure is received in contemplating his figure. Now, an actor can do the very same thing. He can <hi>walk over his part:</hi> He can miss no more of his words than the Horse does of his way: he can be as dull, and as tedious, and as good-looking as the Horse in his progress:—The only difference between the two animals is,—that the Horse brings in him who bets upon him a gainer; but the luckless wight who has a large stake depending upon the actor is, decidedly, certain to lose. There is a trick, too, that the Jockies practise, which is called, I think, <hi>playing booty.</hi> This consists in appearing to use their utmost endeavour to reach the winning-post first, when they are already determined to come in the last. The consequence is, that all, except the knowing ones, attribute no fault to the Jockey, but damn the Horse for a sluggard.—An actor can <hi>play booty</hi> if he chuses:—he can pretend to whip and spur, and do his best, when the Connoisseur knows, all the while, he is shirking:—but
<pb n="xx" facs="19"/>
Sluggard is the unmerited appellation given by the majority to the innocent author..</p>
<p>Mr. KEMBLE chiefly chose to be Horse, and <hi>walked over the ground.</hi> Every now and then (but scarcely enough to save appearances) he gave a slight touch of the Jockey, and <hi>played booty.</hi></p>
<p>Whether the language which is put into the mouth of <hi>Sir Edward Mortimer</hi> be above mediocrity, or below contempt, is not to the present purpose: but the words he is made to utter certainly convey a meaning; and the circumstances of the scenes afford an opportunity to the Performer of playing off his mimick emotions, his transitions of passion, his starts, and all the trickeries of his trade. The devil a trick did Mr. KEMBLE play but a very scurvy one! His emotions and passions were so rare, and so feeble, that they seasoned his general insipidity, like a single grain of wretched pepper thrown into the largest dose of water-gruel that ever was administered to an invalid. For the most part, he toiled on, line after line, in a dull current of undiversified sound, which stole upon the ear far more drowsily than the distant murmurings of Lethe; with no attempt to break the lulling stream, or check its sleep-inviting course.</p>
<p>Frogs in a marsh, flies in a bottle; wind in a crevice, a preacher in a field, the drone of a bagpipe, all, all yielded to the inimitable, and soporific monotony of Mr. KEMBLE!</p>
<p>The very best Dramatick writing, where passion is expressed, if delivered languidly by the Actor, will fail in it's intended effect: and I will be bold enough to say that were the <hi>Curse in King Lear</hi> new to an audience, and they heard
<pb n="xxi" facs="20"/>
it uttered, for the first time, in a croak, fainter than a crow's in a consumption, it would pass unnoticed, or appear vapid to the million.</p>
<p>If I raise a critical clatter about my ears, by this assertion, which some may twist into a profanation of Shakspeare, I leave it to Horace, who can fight battles better than I, to defend me.</p>
<l>"Si dicentis erunt fortunis absona dicta,"</l>
<l>"Romani tollent pedites equitesque cachinnum."</l>
<p>That Mr. KEMBLE did not misconceive the Part is certain; for he told me, some time before the Play was acted, that he feared the exertions requisite, in <hi>Sir Edward Mortimer,</hi> would strain his lungs more than <hi>Octavian,</hi> in the <hi>Mountaineers.</hi></p>
<p>That he can strain his lungs, to good purpose, in <hi>Octavian,</hi> is well known; and, after this, his own intimation, how will he escape the charge of wilful and direct delinquency, when, with such a conception of the Part, and with health recovered, he came forward in the true spirit of <hi>Bottom,</hi> and <hi>"aggravated his voice so that he roared you as gentle as any sucking dove?"</hi><note n="*" place="foot">Mr. KEMBLE informed me, previous to the second representation of the Play, that he felt himself capable of exertion.</note></p>
<p>He insulted the Town, and injured his Employer, and the Author, sufficiently in the first instance: in the second he added to the insult and injury an hundred-fold: and as often as he mangled the Character (three or four times, I am uncertain which, after the first night's performance) he heaped aggravation upon aggravation.</p>
<p><pb n="xxii" facs="21"/>The most miserable mummer, that ever disgraced the walls of a Theatre, could not have been a stronger drawback than Mr. KEMBLE.— He was not only dull in himself, but the cause of dulness in others. Like the baleful <hi>Upas of Java,</hi> his pestiferous influence infected all around him. When two Actors come forward, to keep up the Shuttle cock of scenick-fiction, if one plays slovenly, the other cannot maintain his game. Poor BANNISTER, Jun. would he speak out (but I have never pressed him, and never shall press him to say a word upon the subject) could bear ample testimony to the truth of this remark. He suffered like a man under the cruelty of <hi>Mezentius.</hi> All alive himself, he was tied to a corpse, which he was fated to drag about with him, scene after scene, which weighed him down, and depressed his vigour. Miss FARREN, too, who might animate any thing but a soul of lead, and a face of iron, experienced the same fate.</p>
<p>I could proceed, and argue, and reason, and discuss, and tire the reader, as I have tired myself (it is now, my good friend, one o'clock in the morning) to prove, further, that Mr. KEMBLE was unsound in my cause, and that he ruined my Play:—But I will desist here. I think I have <hi>prosed</hi> enough to manifest that my arguments are not unfounded.</p>
<p>They who are experienced in <hi>Dramaticks</hi> will, I trust, see that I have made a fair <hi>extenuation</hi> of myself—they who are impartial will, I hope, be convinced that I have set down <hi>nought in malice.</hi></p>
<p>The only question that may arise to shake, materially, the credit of all I have said, is—
<pb n="xxiii" facs="22"/>
"How is it probable that Mr. KEMBLE should injure you thus, without provocation? Is it in nature? Is it in man?" I can merely answer that I am unconscious of having given him cause for provocation; that if I have given him cause, he has taken a bad mode of revenge; that Mr. KEMBLE's nature has frequently puzzled me in my observation upon it; and that I think him a very <hi>extraordinary man.</hi></p>
<p>But let him take this with him, should this crudely written Preface ever fall in his way. I have committed it to paper <hi>currente calamo.</hi> I mean no allusion, no epithet, to apply to him as a private individual. As a private individual I give him not that notice which it might, here, be impertinent to bestow:—but I have an undoubted right to discuss his merits, or demerits, in his publick capacities of Manager and Actor: and my cause of complaint gives me a good reason as well as right. His want of conduct, his neglect, his injustice, his oppression, his finesse, his person, his face, are in this point of view all open to my animadversion.</p>
<l>"He is my goods, my chattlels;"</l>
<l>"My Horse, my Ox, my Ass, my any thing."</l>
<p>And I would animadvert still further, did I not think I had already said sufficient to gain the object of guarding my own reputation. That object has solely swayed me in dwelling so long upon a "plain tale," encumbered with so fatiguing a Hero as JOHN KEMBLE.</p>
</div1>

<pb facs="23"/>
<head><hi>ADVERTISEMENT</hi> TO THE READER.</head>
<p>I AM indebted for the ground-work of this Play to a Novel entitled <hi>"Things as they are, or the Adventures of Caleb Williams; written by William Godwin."</hi> Much of Mr. GODWIN's story I have omitted; much, which I have adopted, I have compressed; much I have added; and much I have taken the liberty to alter.</p>
<p>All this I did that I might fit it, in the best of my judgment, to the stage.</p>
<p>I have cautiously avoided all tendency to that which, vulgarly, (and wrongly, in many instances) is termed Politicks; with which, many have told me, <hi>Caleb Williams</hi> teems.</p>
<p>The stage has, now, no business with Politicks: and, should a Dramatick Author endeavour to dabble in them, it is the Lord Chamberlain's office to check his attempts, before they meet the eye of the Publick. I perused Mr. GODWIN's book, as a tale replete with interesting incident, ingenious in its arrangement,
<pb n="xxvi" facs="24"/>
masterly in its delineation of character, and forcible in its language. I considered it as right of Common; and, by a title which custom has given to Dramatists, I enclosed it within my theatrical paling. However I may have tilled the land, I trust he discovers no intentional injury to him, in my proceeding.</p>
<p>To all the Performers (excepting Mr. KEMBLE) I offer my hearty thanks for their exertions; which would have served me more, had not an actor, <hi>"dark as Erebus,"</hi> cast a gloom upon them, which none of their efforts, however brilliant, could entirely disperse.</p>
<p>But this does not diminish my obligations to them:—so much, indeed, I owe to them, that, when the Play was last performed, it was rising, spite of <hi>Erebus,</hi> in favour with the Town. It was, then, advertised, day after day, at the bottom of the Play-bills, for repetition, till the promissory advertisement became laughable; and, at length, the Advertisement and the Play were dropt together.</p>
<p>If, after the foregoing Preface, I should at a future period, bring the Play forward in the Hay-market Theatre, I am fully aware of the numbers who from party and pique, may now oppose it. I am aware, too, of the weight which a first impression leaves upon the minds of the most candid:—Still, so strong is my confidence in the genuine decision of a London audience, who have a fair opportunity of exercising their judgment and feelings, (which they have not had, yet, in respect to this Play) that I believe I shall venture an appeal.</p>
<p>The Piece is, now, printed as it was acted on the <hi>first night</hi>; that they who peruse it may
<pb n="xxvii" facs="25"/>
decide whether, even in that shape, (with all the misfortunes, before enumerated, with which it was doomed to struggle) it should be, for ever, consigned to moulder on the shelf.</p>
<p>The Songs, Duets, and Chorusses, are intended merely as vehicles for musical effect. Some criticks have pompously called them <hi>Lyrick Poetry</hi>—that by raising them to dignity they may more effectually degrade them: as men lift a stone very high, before they let it fall, when they would completely dash it to pieces.</p>
<p>I, now, leave the gentle reader to the perusal of the Play—and, lest my Father's memory may be injured by mistakes; and, in the confusion of after-times, the <hi>Translator of Terence,</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>The Jealous Wife,</hi> be supposed guilty of the <hi>Iron Chest</hi>; I shall, were I to reach the Patriarchal longevity of Methusaleh, continue (in all my Dramatick publications) to subscribe myself</p>

<p>I prithee, now, do not chide me, Samson.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>'Tis my humour. I am father's head man in his poaching. The rubs I take from him, who is above me, I hand down to you, who are below me. 'Tis the way of office—where every miserable devil domineers it over the next more miserable devil that's under him. You may scold sister Margery, an you will—she's your younger by a twelvemonth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Truly brother, I would not make any one unhappy, for the world. I am content to do what I can to please; and to mind the house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>Truly, a weighty matter! Thou art e'en ready to hang thyself, for want of something to white away time. What hast thou much more to do than to trim the faggots, nurse thy mother, boil the pot, patch our jackets, kill the poultry, cure the hogs, seed the pigs, and comb the children?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Many might think that no small charge, Samson.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="29"/>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>A mere nothing.—While father and I (bate us but the mother and children) have the credit of purloining every single thing that you have the care of. We are up early, and down late, in the exercise of our industry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>I wish father and you would give up the calling.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>No—there is one keen argument to prevent us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>What's that, brother?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>Hunger. Wouldst have us be rogues, and let our family starve? Give up poaching and deer-stealing! Oons! dost think we have no conscience? Yonder sits mother, poor soul—old, helpless, and crazy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Alas! brother, 'tis heart-aching to look upon her. This very time three years she got her maim. It was a piteous tempest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>Aye—'twas rough weather.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>I never pass the old oak that was shivered that night, in the storm, but I am ready to weep. It remembers me of the time when all our poor family went to ruin.</p>

<speaker>Sam</speaker>
<p>Pish—no matter: The cottage was blown down—the barn fired—father undone.—Well, landlords are flinty hearted—no help! what then? We live, don't we?<stage>sullenly.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Troth, brother, very sadly. Father has grown desperate; all is fallen to decay. We live by pilfering on the Forest—and our poor mother distracted, and unable to look to the house. The rafter, which fell in the storm, struck so heavy upon her brain, I fear me, 'twill never again be settled.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>O heaven! 'tis the voice of Wilford himself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>Wilford! I'am glad on't—Now he shall— I'am glad on't. Open the door: Quickly, I say. He shall smart for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>Are you mad, father? 'Tis we shall smart for it. Let in the keeper's head man! The hind quarter of a buck has hung these fourteen days, in the pantry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>Open, I say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>O Lord! I defy any secretary's nose not to smell stolen venison the moment 'tis thrust into our hovel.</p>
</sp>
<stage>SAMSON <hi>opens the door. Enter</hi> WILFORD.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Save you, good people. You are Gilbert Rawbold, as I take it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="34"/>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>I am. Your message here, young man, bodes me no good: but I <hi>am</hi> Gilbert Rawbold—and here's my daughter. Do'st know her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Barbara, good wench! how fares it with you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>Look on her well—then consult your own conscience. 'Tis difficult, haply, for a secretary to find one. You are a villain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>You lie. Hold, I crave pardon. You are her father. She is innocent, and you are unhappy: I respect virtue and misfortune too much to shock the one or insult the other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>Sdeath! why meet my daughter in the forest?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Because I love her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>And would ruin her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>That's a strange way of shewing one's love, methinks. I have a simple notion, Gilbert, that the thought of having taken a base advantage of a poor girl's affection might go nigh to break a man's sleep, and give him unquiet dreams: now, I love my night's rest, and shall do nothing to disturb it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>Would'st not poison her mind?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>'Tis not my method, friend, of dosing a patient. Look ye, Gilbert; Her mind is a fair flower, stuck in the rude soil, here, of surrounding ignorance, and smiling in the chill of poverty:— I would feign cheer it with the little sun-shine I possess of comfort and information. My parents were poor like her's; Should occasion serve, I might, haply, were all parties agreed, make her my wife. To offer aught else would affect her, you, and myself; and I have no talent at making three people uneasy at the same time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>Your hand. On your own account, we are friends.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>O dear father!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>Be silent. Now to your errand. 'Tis from Mortimer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>I come from Sir Edward.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="35"/>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>I know his malice. He would oppress me with his power. He would starve me and my family. Search my house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>No, father, no. You forget the hind quarter in the pantry. <stage>Aside</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>Let him do his worst: but let him beware. A tyrant; a villain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Harkye—he is my master. I owe him my gratitude;—every thing:—and had you been any but my Barbara's father, and spoken so much against him, my indignation had work'd into my knuckles, and cram'd the words down your rusty throat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>I do begin to perceive how this will end. Father will knock down the secretary as flat as a buck.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>Why am I singled out? Is there no mark for the vengeance of office to shoot its shaft at but me. This morning, as he dog'd me in the forest —</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Hush, Rawbold. Keep your counsel.— Should you make it publick he must notice it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>Did he not notice it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>No matter—but he has sent me thus early, Gilbert, with this relief to your distresses, which he has heard of. Here are twenty marks for you and your family.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>From Sir Edward Mortimer?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>'Tis his way;—but he would not have it mention'd. He is one of those judges who, in their office, will never warp the law to save offenders; but his private charity bids him assist the needy, before their necessities drive them to crimes which his public duty must punish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Raw.</speaker>
<p>Did Mortimer do this! did he! heaven bless him! Oh, young man, if you knew half the misery—my wife—my children—Shame on't! I have stood many a tug, but the drops now fall in spite of me. I am not ungrateful; but I cannot stand it. We will talk of Barbara when I have more man about me. <stage>Exit up the stair-case.</stage></p>

<p>These fatigues of office somewhat wear a man. I have had a long lease on't. I ha' seen out Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, and King James.

<p>Nay, then, let us not meet often, or you will soon be in your second child-hood.</p>

<p>What, you come from your mistress, the Lady Helen, in the forest here; and would speak with Sir Edward Mortimer, I warrant?</p>

<p>A blessing on his heart! I would it were merrier. Well, she is much beholden to Sir Edward for his consolation: and he never affords her his advice but his bounty is sure to follow it.</p>

<p>Just so a crow will nourish its nestling: be croaks first, and then gives her food.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha! good i'faith!—but wicked. Thy company will corrupt, and lead me astray. Should they happen to marry, (and I have my fancies on't,) I'll dance a galliard with thee in the hall, on the round Oak table. Sbud! when I was a youth, I would ha' caper'd with St. Vitus, and beat him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>You are as likely to dance, now, as they to marry. What has hindered them, if the parties be agreed?—yet I have, now, been with my mistress these two years; since Sir Edward first came hither, and placed her in the cottage, hard by his lodge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Tush! family reasons.—Thou knowest nothing: thou art scarce catch'd. Two years back, when we came from Kent, and Sir Edward first entered on his office, here, of Head Keeper, thou wert a Colt, running wild about New Forest. I hired you myself to attend on madam Helen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Nay I shall never forget it. But you were as frolicksome, then, as I, methinks. Dost remember the box on the ear I gave thee, Adam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Peace, peace, you pie! an you prate thus I'll stop your mouth. I will, by St. Thomas!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>An I be inclined to the contrary, I do not think you are able to stop it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Out, you baggage! thou hast more tricks than a kitten. Well, go thy ways. Sir Edward is at his study, and there thou wilt find him. Ah, mistress Blanch! had you but seen me in the early part of Queen Elizabeth's reign!</p>

At times, the wild glare of his eye is frightful; and, last night, when I was writing for him, in the library, I could not help fancying I was shut up with the devil — I would stake my life there's a secret; and I could almost give my life to unravel it.

<p>I would you could instil some mirth into our good master Sir Edward. You are an old domestick—the only one he brought with him, two years back, from Kent,—and might venture to give his spirits a jog. He seems devour'd with spleen and melancholy.</p>

<p>There is something marvellous engaging in this young man. You have a world of promise, boy. Sixty years ago, in Queen Elizabeth's time, I was just such another. I remember Marian Potpan, the farmer's daughter, of Stocks Green, was then enamour'd of me. Well, beware how you offend Sir Edward.</p>

<p>Dear sir, 'tis your counsel which most I covet. Give me but that; admit me to your confidence; steer me with your advice, which I ever held excellent, and, with such a pilot, I may sail prosperously through a current which, otherwise, might wrerk me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Ah, wag! well, go thy ways! Well, when I was of thy age—odsbud! no matter; 'tis past, now;—but here's the little Mrs. Blanch— <stage>drinks.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>'Tis thought, here, Sir Edward means to marry her lady, Madame Helen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I know not. She has long been enamour'd of him, poor lady! when he was the gay, the gallant Sir Edward, in Kent. Ah, well! two years make a wond'rous change!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Yes, 'tis a good tough love, now-a-days, that will hold out a couple of twelve-months.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="19" facs="45"/>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Away, I mean not so, you giddy pate! He is all honour; and as steady in his course as the sun: yet I wonder sometimes he can bear to look upon her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Eh? why so? Did not he bring her, under his protection, to the Forest; since, 'tis said, she lost her relations?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Hush, boy! on your life do not name, her uncle—I would say her relations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Her uncle! wherefore? Where's the harm in having an uncle, dead or alive?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Peace, peace! In that uncle lies the secret.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! how good Adam Winterton? I prithee, how?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Ah! 'twas a heavy day! Poor Sir Edward is now a broken spirit—but if ever a good spirit walk'd the earth in trunk hose, he is one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Let us drink Sir Edward's health.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>That I would, tho' 'twere a mile to the bottom— <stage>drinks.</stage> Ha, 'tis cheering, i'faith! Well, in troth, I have a regard for thee, boy, for thy father's sake.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Oh, good sir! and this uncle, you say—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Of Madam Helen—ah! there lies the mischief.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>What mischief can be in him? why, he is dead.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Come nearer—see you prate not now, on your life. Our good master, Sir Edward, was arraign'd on his account, in open court.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Arraign'd! how mean you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Alas, boy! tried.—Tried for—nearer yet—his murder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Mu—mu—Murder!<stage>drops the glass.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Why, what! why, Wilford! out, alas! the boy's passion will betray all! what, Wilford, I say!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>You have curdled my blood!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>What, varlet, thou darest not think ill of our worthy master?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20" facs="46"/>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>I—I am his secretary. Often alone with him at dead midnight, in his library. The candles in the sockets—and a man glaring upon me who has committed mur—ugh!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Committed! Thou art a base lying knave, to say it: and while I wear a rapier, I'll— tush! Heaven help me! I forget I am fourscore. Well, well—hear me, pettish boy, hear me. Why, look now, thou dost not attend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>I—I mark; I mark.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>I tell thee, then, our good Sir Edward was beloved in Kent, where he had returned a year before from his travels. Madam Helen's uncle was hated by all the neighbourhood, rich and poor. A mere brute, dost mark me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Like enough: but when brutes walk upon two legs, the law of the land, thank Heaven! will not suffer us to butcher them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Go to, you fire-brand! Our good master labour'd all he could, for many a month, to soothe his turbulence; but in vain. He pick'd a quarrel with Sir Edward, in the publick county assembly; nay, the strong ruffian struck him down, and trampled on him. Think on that, Wilford; on our good master Sir Edward, whose great soul was nigh to burst with the indignity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Well, but the end on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Why, our young master took horse, for his own house, determined, as it appear'd, to send a challenge to this white-liver'd giant in the morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>I see. He kill'd him in a duel. That's another kind of butchery, which the law allows not; true humanity shudders at, and false honour justifies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>See, now, how you fly off! Sir Edward's revenge, boy, was baffled. For his antagonist was found dead in the street, that night; killed, by some unknown assassins, on his return from the assembly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! <hi>unknown</hi> assassins!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Nay, 'tis plain, our good Sir Edward had no hand in the wicked act: for he was tried, as
<pb n="21" facs="47"/>
I told you, at the next assize. Mercy on me! 'twas a crowded court; and both gentle and simple threw up their caps, at his acquital! Heaven be thank'd! he was cleared beyond a shadow of doubt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>He was; I breathe again. 'Twas a happy thing. 'Twas the only way left of cleansing him from a foul suspicion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Out alas! lad, 'tis his principal grief. He is full of nice feeling, and high-flown honour: and the thought of being tried, for such a crime, has given him his hear's wound. Poor gentleman! he has shun'd the world ever since. He was once the life of all company—but now!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Edward</speaker>
<p><stage>without</stage> Winterton!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Hark! some one calls. Out on thee, thou hast sunk my spirits into my heels. Who calls merry old Adam Winterton?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Edward</speaker>
<p><stage>without</stage> Adam Winterton! come hither to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Nay, by our lady, 'tis Sir Edward himself! —Pestilence on't! if I seem sad now, 'twill be noted. I come, good Sir Edward.</p>
<l><hi>"When birds</hi>—(not a word on thy life)— <hi>do carrol on the bush,"</hi></l>
<l><hi>"With a hey no nonny'</hi>—Mercy on me!<stage>Exit.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>My throat's parch'd, and my blood freezes. A quart of brandy couldn't moisten the one nor thaw the other. This accounts, then, for all. Poor, unhappy gentleman! This unravels all, from the first day of my service—when a deep groan made me run into the library, and I found him locking up his papers, in the Iron Chest, as pale as ashes.—Eh?— What can be in that chest!—Perhaps some proof of —no I shudder at the suggestion—'Tis not possible one so good can be guilty of—I know not what to think —nor what to resolve. But curiosity is roused, and, come what may, I'll have an eye upon him. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>

<p>Is this the high-flown honour, and delicate feeling, old Winterton talk'd of, that cannot bear a glance at the trial?—Delicate! had I been born under a throttling planet, I had never survived this collaring. This may be guilt. If so—well, what have I to do with the knowledge on't!—what <hi>could</hi> I do? cut off my benefactor! who gives me bread! who is respected for his virtues, pitied for his misfortunes, loved by his family, bless'd by the poor!— Pooh! he is innocent. This is his pride and shame. He was acquitted—Thousands witness'd it—thousands rejoiced at it—thousands —eh? the key left in the iron chest! Circumstance and mystery tempt me at every turn.

<head><hi>SCENE I.</hi>—</head><stage>The New Forest.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ARMSTRONG <hi>and</hi> ORSON.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ARMSTRONG.</speaker>
<p>GO to—I tell thee, Orson, (as I have told thee more than once) thou art too sanguinary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>And, I tell you, Captain Armstrong—but always under favour, you being our leader—you are too humane.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>Humanity is scarcely counted a fault: if so, 'tis a fault on the right side.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>Umph! perhaps not with us. We are robbers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>And why should robbers lack humanity? They who plunder most respect it as a virtue, and make a shew on't to gild their vices. Lawyers, Physicians, Placemen, all—all plunder and slay, but all pretend to humanity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>They are Regulars, and plunder by licence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>Then let us Quacks set the regulars a better example.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>This humanity, Captain, is a high horse you are ever bestride upon. Some day, mark my word, he'll fling you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>Cruelty is a more dangerous beast:—When the rider's thrown, his brains are kick'd out, and no one pities him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>Like enough; but your tough horseman, who ventures boldly, is never dismounted. When I am engaged in a desperate chace, (as we are, Captain,) I stick at nothing. I hate milk sops.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="30" facs="56"/>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>And love mutiny. Take heed, Orson, I have before caution'd you not to glance at me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>I say nothing: but if some escape to inform against us, whom we have rob'd, 'tis none of my fault. Dead men tell no tales.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>Wretch! Speak that again, and you shall tell none. <stage>holds a carbine to his head</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>Flash away!—I don't fear death.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>More shame for thee; for thou art unfit to meet it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>I know my trade. I set powder, ball, and rope, at defiance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>Brute! You mistake headstrong insensibility for courage. Do not mistake my horror of it for cowardice: for I, who shudder at cruelty, will fell your boldness to the earth, when I see you practise it. Submit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>I do. I know not what 'tis, but I have told you, often, there is something about you awes me. I cannot tell—I could kill twenty to your one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>There 'tis.—Thou wouldst dart upon the weak unguarded man, like a tyger. A ferocious animal, whether crawling or erect, ever slinks from fair opposition.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>My courage was never yet doubted, Captain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>Your nerves, fool. Thou art a mere machine. Could I but give it motion, I would take an oak from the forest, here, clap a flint into it for heart, and make as bold a fellow as thou art. Listen to my orders.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>I obey.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>Get thee to our den. Put on thy disguise —then hie thee to the market town for provision, for our company. Here—Here is part of the spoil we took yester-night: see you bring an honest account of what you lay out. <stage>giving Money</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>My honour!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>Well, I do not doubt thee, here. Our profession is singular; its followers do not cheat one another. You will not be back till dusk. See you fall not on any poor straggling peasant, as you return.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="57"/>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>I would fain encounter the solitary man, who is sometimes wandering by night about the forest. He is rich.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>Not for your life. 'Tis Sir Edward Mortimer, the head keeper. Touch him not; 'tis too near home. Besides, he is no object for plunder. I have watch'd him, at midnight, stealing from his lodge, to wander like one crazed. He is good, too, to the poor; and should walk unmolested by Charity's charter. 'Twere pity that he who administers to necessity, all day, should be rifled by necessity at night. An thou shouldst meet him, I charge thee spare him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ors.</speaker>
<p>I must, if it be your order. This sparing doctrine will go nigh, at last, to starve all the thieves. When a man takes to the trade of a wolf, he should not go like a lamb to his business. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<p>This fellow is a downright villain: Harden'd and relentless. I have felt, in my penury, the world trample on me. It has driven me to take that, desperately, which wanting I should starve. Death! my spirit cannot brook to see a sleek knave walk negligently by his fellow in misery, and suffer him to rot. I will wrench that comfort from him which he will not bestow.—But nature puts a bar:—Let him administer to my wants, and pass on:—I have done with him.</p>

<l>When the Robber his victim has noted,</l>

<l>Since my hope is by penury blighted,</l>

<l>A book to me's a sovereign Narcotick;</l>
<l>A lump of opium; every line a dose.</l>
<l>Edward is all deep reading, and black letter;</l>
<l>He shews it in his very chin. He speaks</l>
<l>Mere Dictionary; and he pores on pages</l>
<l>That gives plain men the head-ach. "Scarce, and curious,"</l>
<l>Are baits his learning nibbles at. His brain</l>
<l>Is cram'd with mouldy volumes, cramp, and useless,</l>
<l>Like a librarian's lumber-room.—Poor fellow!</l>

<l>Brother, a man must rule his family</l>
<l>In his own way.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>Well, well, well—Don't be touchy.</l>
<l>I speak not to offend: I only speak</l>
<l>On a friend's privilege. The poor are men,</l>
<l>And have their feelings, brother.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<p>So have I!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>One of the best that we can shew, believe me,</l>
<l>Is mildness to a servant. Servants, brother,</l>
<l>Are born with fortune's yoke about their necks;</l>
<l>And that is galling in itself enough;</l>
<l>We should not goad them under it. The master</l>
<l>Should rather cheer them in their servitude,</l>
<l>With kindly words—not too familiar neither;</l>
<l>But utter'd with that air which true benevolence</l>
<l>Imparts to dignified nobility.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Brother, your hand. You have a gentle nature—</l>
<l>May no mischance e'er ruffle it, my brother!</l>
<l>I've known thee from my infancy, old soldier;</l>
<l>And never did I know—I do not flatter—</l>
<l>A heart more stout, more cased with hardy manhood,</l>
<l>More full of milk within. Trust me, dear friend,</l>
<l>If admiration of thy charity</l>
<l>May argue charity in the admirer,</l>
<l>I am not destitute.</l>

<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>You!—I have seen you</l>
<l>Sometimes o'erflow with it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>And what avails it?</l>
<l>Honour has been my theme; good will to man</l>
<l>My study. I have labour'd for a name</l>
<l>As white as mountain snow; dazzling, and speckless:</l>
<l>Shame on't! 'tis blur'd with blots! Fate, like a mildew,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Yes, so please you, Madam Helen, for want of a better.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<p>Why, I have seen you in the forest— at Rawbold's cottage. He is your father, as I think.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Yes, so please you, Madam; for want of a better.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<p>I fear me you may well say that. Your father, as I have heard, bears an ill name, in the forest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Alas! madam he is obliged to bear it— for want of a better. We are all famish'd, madam: and the naked and hungry have seldom many friends to speak well of them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<p>If I should hire thee, who will give thee a character?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>My father, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<p>Why sirrah, he has none of his own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>The more fatherly in him, madam, to give his son what he has need of, for himself. But a knave is often applied to, to vouch for a good servant's honesty. I will serve you as faithfully as your last footman; who, I have heard, ran away this morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<p>Truly, he did so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>I was told on't, some half hour ago; and ran, hungrily, hither, to offer myself. So, please you, let not poverty stand in the way of my preferment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="42" facs="68"/>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<p>Should I entertain you, what could you do to make yourself useful?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Any thing. I can wire hares, snare partridges, shoot a buck, and smuggle brandy, for you, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<p>Fie on you, knave! 'Twere fitter to turn you over to the Verderors of the forest, for punishment, than to encourage you in such practices.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>I would practise any thing better, that might get me bread. I would scrape trenchers, fill buckets, and carry a message. What can a man do! He can't starve.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<p>Well, sirrah, to snatch thee from evil, I care not if I make trial of thee?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>No! will you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<p>Nineteen in twenty might question my prudence for this:—but, whatever loss I may suffer from thy roguery, the thought of having open'd a path to lead a needy wanderer back to virtue, will more than repay me.</p>

<p>Blanch stays a tedious time. Heaven send Mortimer's health be not worse! He is sadly altered since we came to the forest. I dream'd last night, of the fire he saved me from; and I saw him, all fresh, in manly bloom, bearing me through the flames, even as it once happened.</p>

<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>

<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>A little breath, madam, and I will answer all duly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<l>O! fie up in thee, wench!</l>
<l>These interrogatories should be answered</l>
<l>Quicker than breath can utter them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>That's impossible, lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<l>Thou would'st not say so hadst thou ever lov'd.</l>
<l>Love has a fleeter messenger than speech,</l>
<l>To tell love's meaning. His expresses post</l>
<l>Upon the orbs of vision, ere the tongue</l>
<l>Can shape them into words. A lover's look</l>
<l>Is his heart's Mercury. O! the Eye's eloquence,</l>
<l>Twin-born with thought, outstrips the tardy voice,</l>
<l>Far swifter than the nimble lightning's flash</l>
<l>The sluggish thunder-peal that follows it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>I am not skill'd in eye-talking, madam. I have been used to let my discourse ride upon my tongue, and, I have been told, 'twill trot at a good round pace upon occasion.</p>

<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<l>Then let it gallop, now, beseech you, wench,</l>
<l>And bring me news of Mortimer.</l>

<p>Then, madam, I saw Sir Edward in his library: and deliver'd your letter. He will be here either in the evening, or on the morrow: 'tis uncertain which—for his brother, Capt. Fitzharding, is arrived on a visit to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Is he?—well, that may somewhat raise his spirits.</l>
<l>That soldier has a pleasant, harmless mind.</l>
<l>Mirth gilds his age, and sits upon his brow</l>
<l>Like sun in winter. I ne'er saw a man</l>
<l>More cheerful in decline, more laughter-loving,</l>
<l>More gay, and frolicksome.</l>

<p>You talk'd to me so much of reading eyes, madam, that I e'en forgot the letter. Here it is.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Helen.</speaker>
<l>Come to me, shortly, in my cabinet:</l>
<l>I'll read it there.—I am almost unfit</l>

<p>Oh, lord! this is the maid.—I mean the waiting-woman. I warrant we shall be rare company, in a long winter's evening.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Why, who are you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>I'm your fellow-servant:—the new comer. The last footman cast his skin in the pantry this morning, and I have crept into it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Why, sure, it cannot be!—Now I look upon you again, you are Samson Rawbold—old Rawbold's son, of the forest here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>The same; I am not like some upstarts; When I am prosperous, I do not turn my back on my poor relations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>What, has my lady hired thee?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>She has taken me, like a pad nag, upon trial.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>I suspect you will play her a jade's trick, and stumble in your probation. You have been caught tripping, ere now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>An I do not give content 'tis none of my fault. A man's qualities cannot come out all at once. I wish you would teach me a little how to lay a cloth.</p>

<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>You are well qualified for your office truly, not to know that!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>To say truth, we had little practice that way at home. We stood not upon forms. We had sometimes no cloth for a dinner.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>And, sometimes, no dinner for a cloth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Just so. We had little order in our family.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Well, I will instruct you.</p>

<p>That's kind. I will be grateful. They tell me I have learnt nothing but wickedness yet: but I will instruct you in any thing I know, in return.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>There I have no mind to become your scholar. But be steady in your service, and you may outlive your beggary, and grow into respect.</p>

<l>You had this trembling, it is scarce a week,</l>
<l>At Madam Helen's.</l>
</sp>

<p>There it is.—Her Uncle!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Her uncle!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Him. She knows it not—None know it—</l>
<l>You are the first ordained to hear me say,</l>
<l>I am—his murderer.</l>
</sp>

<p>O, heaven!</p>

<p>What you that—mur—the murder— I am choak'd!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Honour, thou blood—stain'd God! at whose red altar</l>
<l>Sit War and Homicide, O, to what madness</l>
<l>Will insult drive thy votaries! By heaven,</l>
<l><pb n="50" facs="76"/>In the world's range there does not breathe a man</l>
<l>Whose brutal nature I more strove to soothe,</l>
<l>With long forbearance, kindness, courtesy,</l>
<l>Than his who fell by me. But he disgraced me,</l>
<l>Stain'd me,—oh, death, and shame!—the world look'd on,</l>
<l>And saw this sinewy savage strike me down;</l>
<l>Rain blows upon me, drag me to and fro,</l>
<l>On the base earth, like carrion, Desperation,</l>
<l>In every fibre of my frame, cried vengeance!</l>
<l>I left the room, which he had quitted. Chance</l>
<l>(Curse on the chance!) while boiling with my wrongs,</l>
<l>Thrust me against him, darkling, in the street:—</l>
<l>I stab'd him to the heart:—and my oppressor</l>
<l>Roll'd, lifeless, at my foot.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<l>Oh! mercy on me!</l>
<l>How could this deed be cover'd!</l>

<l>Would you think it?</l>
<l>E'en at the moment when I gave the blow,</l>
<l>Butcher'd a fellow-creature in the dark,</l>
<l>I had all good mens love. But my disgrace,</l>
<l>And my opponent's death, thus link'd with it,</l>
<l>Demanded notice of the magistracy.</l>
<l>They summon'd me, as friend would summon friend,</l>
<l>To acts of import, and communication.</l>
<l>We met: and 'twas resolved, to stifle rumour,</l>
<l>To put me on my trial. No accuser,</l>
<l>No evidence appeared, to urge it on.—</l>
<l>'Twas meant to clear my fame.—How clear it, then?</l>
<l>How cover it? you say.—Why, by a Lie:</l>
<l>Guilt's offspring, and its guard. I taught this breast,</l>
<l>Which Truth once made her throne, to forge a lie;</l>
<l>This tongue to utter it.—Rounded a tale,</l>
<l>Smooth as a Seraph's song from Satan's mouth;</l>
<l>So well compacted, that the o'er throng'd court</l>
<l>Disturb'd cool justice, in her judgment-seat,</l>
<l>By shouting "Innocence!" ere I had finish'd.</l>
<l>The Court enlarged me; and the giddy rabble</l>
<l>Bore me, in triumph, home. Aye!—look upon me!—</l>
<l>I know thy sight aches at me.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>I disdain all pity.—</l>
<l>I ask no consolation. Idle boy!</l>
<l>Think'st thou that this compulsive confidence</l>
<l>Was given to move thy pity?—Love of fame</l>
<l>(For still I cling to it) has urged me, thus,</l>
<l>To quash thy curious mischief in its birth.</l>
<l>Hurt honour, in an evil, cursed hour,</l>
<l>Drove me to murder—lying:—'twould again.</l>
<l>My honesty,—sweet peace of mind,—all, all!</l>
<l>Are barter'd for a name. I <hi>will</hi> maintain it.</l>
<l>Should slander whisper o'er my sepulchre,</l>
<l>And my soul's agency survive in death,</l>
<l>I could embody it with heaven's lightning,</l>
<l>And the hot shaft of my insulted spirit</l>
<l>Should strike the blaster of my memory</l>
<l>Dead in the church-yard. Boy, I would not kill thee:</l>
<l>Thy rashness and discernment threaten'd danger:</l>
<l>To check them there was no way left but this:</l>
<l>Save one—your death:—you shall not be my victim.</l>

<p>Empty! Groveling fool!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<l>I am your servant, Sir: child of your bounty;</l>
<l>And know my obligation. I have been</l>
<l>Too curious, haply; 'tis the fault of youth.</l>
<l>I ne'er meant injury: if it would serve you,</l>
<l>I would lay down my life; I'd give it freely:—</l>

<l>Some hours ago you durst not. Passion moved you;</l>

<l>But, should reflection prompt you to attempt it,</l>
<l>My innocence would give me strength to struggle,</l>

<l>'Tis plain I dare not take your life. To spare it,</l>

<l>The Monks are gone:—</l>

<l>Let's ring their knell.</l>
<l>Ding dong! ding dong! to the bald-pated monk!</l>

<stage>SAMSON <hi>and</hi> BLANCH, <hi>discover'd, at a Table, with Bottle and Glasses.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BLANCH.</speaker>
<p>SAMSON, you must drink no more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>One more glass, Mistress Blanch, and I shall be better company. 'Twill make me loving.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Nay, then, you shall not have a drop.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>I will:—and so shall you too. <stage>filling the glass</stage> Who knows but it may make you the same?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>You are wond'rous familiar, Mr Lout.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>I would not willingly offend. I will endeavour at more respect. My humble duty to you. <stage>drinks.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>I would counsel you to be cautious of drinking, Samson. Consider where you are. We are now, remember, in Sir Edward Mortimer's Lodge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>In the Butler's room;—where drinking has always a privilege. <stage>fills.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>What, another!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Do not fear. 'Twill not make me familiar again. My lowly respects to yon. <stage>drinks.</stage> This same old Winterton's wine has a marvellous choice flavour. I wonder whether 'twas smuggled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Should you totter with this, now, in the morning, 'twould go nigh to shake your office to the foundation, before night. My Lady would never pardon you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>'Twould be hard to turn me adrift, for getting drunk, on the second day of my service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="62" facs="88"/>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Truly, I think 'twould be reason sufficient.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>'Twould not be giving a man a fair trial. How should she know but I intend to be sober for a year after?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch,</speaker>
<p>How should she know, indeed! or any one else, who has heard of your former rogueries.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Well, the worst fault I had was being a sportsman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>A sportsman! out on you, rogue! you were a poacher.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Aye, so the rich nick-name us poor brothers of the field; and lay us by the heels when we do that for hunger which they practise for amusement. Cannot I move you to take a thimble-full, this cold morning?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Not a drop, I</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Hark! I think I hear old Winterton coming back. By our lady, Mistress Blanch, we have made a desperate hole in the bottle, since he left us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>We! why, you slanderous rogue, I have not tasted it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>No—'tis not he.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>No matter; he will be back on the instant. Leave this idle guzzling, if you have any shame. Think we are attending madam Helen, in her visit to Sir Edward, on his sudden sickness. Think, too, on the confusion from Wilford's flight. Is it a time for you, so, to tipple, when the whole house is in distress and melancholy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Alas! I have too tender a heart, Mistress Blanch; and have need of somewhat, in the midst of this sorrow, to cheer my spirits</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>This wine will shortly give your profession of amendment the lie.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Let it give me the lie: 'Tis an affront I can easily swallow. Come, a bargain—an you will take one glass with me, I will give over.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Well, on that condition—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sam.</speaker>
<p>Agreed— for that will just finish the bottle. <stage>fills.</stage> I will drink no health, now, but of thy giving.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="63" facs="89"/>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Then listen and edify.—May a man never insult a woman with his company, when drunkenness has made him a brute!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart:—But a woman knows that man may be made a brute, when wine is clean out of the question. Eh! Here comes the old man, in real earnest.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ADAM WINTERTON.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Well, I am here again.—What madcap? —In truth, I have a world of care. Our good master taken ill on a sudden. Wilford flown:—A base, ungrateful boy!—One that I was so fond of:—And to prove such a profligate! I began to love the young villain like my own child. I had mark'd down the unfortunate boy, in my last testament: I had— Bless me! my cold is wondrous troublesome to my eyes, this morning. Ah! 'tis a wicked world:— But old Winterton keeps a merry heart still. Do I not, pretty mistress Blanch?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>I hope you do, Adam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Nay, on second thought, I do not keep it; for thou hast stolen it from me, tulip! ha! good ifaith!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha!—Well ifaith that is a good jest! ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Dost think so, varlet? "Thou hast stolen it from me, tulip!" Well, it was; it was exceeding pleasant, by St. Thomas! Heigho! I must e'en take a glass to console me. One cup to—eh! mercy on me! why the liquor has flown. Ha! the bottle has leak'd, haply.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir:—I crack'd that bottle, myself, in your absence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Crack'd! Why what a careless goose art thou! these unthrifty knaves!—ah▪ times are sadly changed for the worse, since I was a boy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Dost think so, Adam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="64" facs="90"/>
<speaker>Adam.</speaker>
<p>Question any man, of my age, and he will say the same. Domesticks never broke bottles in queen Elizabeth's time. Servants were better then— aye, marry, and the bottles were better bottles. 'Tis a degenerate world! Well; heigho!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Why dost sigh thus, Adam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>In truth, this is as heavy a day for me!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>I hope not, Adam. Gome, come, things are not so bad, I warrant thee. You have long drank smilingly of the cup of life, Adam; and when a good man takes his potion without murmuring, Providence seldom leaves the bitterest drop at the bottom. What is the matter, Adam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Alas! nothing but evil. These attacks come on our worthy master as thick as hail, and weaken him daily. He has been grievous ill, in the night, poor soul! and ne'er slept a wink since I brought him the news.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>What news, good Adam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Why of Wilford's flight!—A reprobate! The shock of his baseness has brought on Sir Edward's old symptoms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>What call you his old symptoms?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>The shivering, and trembling its, which have troubled him these two years. I begin to think the air of this forest doth nourish agues. I can never move him to drink enough of canary. I think, in my conscience, I had been aguish myself, in these woods, had I not drank plenty of canary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Mass, when I am ill, this old boy shall be my apothecary. <stage>aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, he may mend. Do not fancy the worst, ere worse arrives, Adam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Nay, worse has arrived already. <hi>Blanch.</hi> Aye! marry, how?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Wilford's villany. Sir Edward says, he has proofs of the blackest treachery against him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>It chills my blood to think on't! I had mark'd out the boy as a boy of promise—A learned
<pb n="65" facs="91"/>
boy! He had the backs of all the books in our library by heart: and now a hue and cry is after him. Mercy on me! if the wretched lad be taken, Sir Edward will bring him to the charge. We none know what 'tis yet; but time will shew.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>You surprise me! Wilford turn dishonest! I could scarce have credited this; and after two years trial, too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>O, monstrous! to turn rogue after two years! Had it happened after two days, indeed, 'twere not to be wonder'd at.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter a Servant.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Ser.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Winterton, there is a young woman of the forest, would speak with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Out on't! These cottagers time their business vilely. Well, bid her come in, Simon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ser.</speaker>
<p>And, Mistress Blanch, your lady would see you anon, in the breakfast parlour. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>I come quickly. Be not cast down, now, Adam; keep thy old heart merry still.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Ha! in truth, I know not well, now, what would mend my spirits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>What think you of the kiss I promis'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Ah, wag! go thy way Od! thou hast nimble legs. Had I o'ertaken thee yesterday—Ah! well, no matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Come, I will not leave thee comfortless, in these sad times Here—Here is my hand, Adam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Thou wilt shew me a light pair of heels again, now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch</speaker>
<p>No, in faith. Come; 'tis more than I would offer to every one. Take it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>That I will, most willingly. <stage>Kisses her hand.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Blanch.</speaker>
<p>Do not play the rake now, and boast of my favours; for I am told there is a breed of puppies will build stories, to a simple girl's prejudice, on
<pb n="66" facs="92"/>
slighter encouragement than this. Be not you one of those empty coxcombs, and so adieu, Adam. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I was never given to vaunt. 'Sbud! if I had, many a tale had been told, sixty years back, of young, lusty Adam Winterton.—Eh! why what dost thou titter at, scapegrace?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>I, sir?—Not I <stage>smothering a laugh.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>I had forgot this varlet. Pestilence on't I Should this knave prate of my little gallantry, I tremble for the good name of poor Mistress Blanch!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Barbara.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>May I come in, good your worship?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Aye, marry, that thou may'st, pretty one. —Well, though many things have declined, since I was a boy, female-beauty keeps its rank still. I do think there be more pretty women now than there were in Queen Elizabeth's reign.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Flesh! this is our Barbara. <stage>aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Well, and what wouldst have, sweet one, with old Adam—Eh! by St. Thomas, why thou art she I have seen, ere now, with Wilford.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>Beseech you, tell me where he is, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Alas, child, he's gone—flown! Eh? what —why art not well, child?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>Nothing, sir—I only—I hoped he would have called at our cottage, ere he quitted the forest. Is there no hope that he may come back, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>None, truly, except force bring him back. Alas, child! the boy has turn'd out naught; and justice is dogging him at the heels.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>What Wilford, sit?—my poor—O, sir, my heart is bursting! I pray you, pardon me. Had he pass'd our cottage in his flight, I would have ran out, and follow'd him all the world over.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>To see what love will do! Just so did Jane Blackthorn take on for me, when Sir Marmaduke carried me to London, in the hard winter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="67" facs="93"/>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>Beseech you, forgive me, sir! I only came to make enquiry, for I had heard a strange tale. I would not have my sorrows make me troublesome to your worship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>To me? poor wench! nay, that thou art not. I trust, child, I never turned a deaf ear, yet, to the unfortunate. 'Tis man's office to listen to the sorrows of a woman, and do all he can to soothe them. Come, come, dry thy tears, chicken.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>I look'd to have been his wife shortly, sir. He was as kind a youth—And, I am sure, he wanted not gratitude. I have heard him talk of you, as you were his father, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Did he? Ah! poor lad. Well, he had good qualities; but, alas! he is now a reprobate. Poor boy! To think, now, that he should speak kindly of the old man, behind his back!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>Alas, this is the second flight to bring unhappiness to our poor family!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>The second! How do'st mean, wench?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>My brother, sir, left our cottage suddenly, yesterday morning; and we have no tidings of him since.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Lo you, now, where he stands, to glad the hearts of his disconsolate relations! Sister Barbara, why dost not know me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>Eh! No—Sure it can't—Brother Samson?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Samson—Head serving man to the Lady Helen, of the New Forest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>O, the fortune! can it be! what gain'd thee so good a place, Samson?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Merit. I had no interest to back me. Mine is a rare case—I was promoted on the score of my virtues.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Out upon thee! thy knaveries have been the talk of the whole forest; and furnish'd daily food for conversation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="68" facs="94"/>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Truly, then, conversation has fared better upon them than I. But my old character is laid aside with my old jerkin. I am now exalted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>An I have any forecast in destiny, friend, thou bidst fair, one day, to be more exalted.— Ha! good ifaith! Come, you must to the kitchen, knave. I must thither myself, to give order for the day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>Must I return home, then, your worship, with no tidings?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wint.</speaker>
<p>Ah! heaven help me! what havock doth wanton Cupid make with us all! Well, tarry about the house, with thy brother; we may hear somewhat, haply, anon. Take care of thy sister, knave; and mark what I have said to thee.—"Thou bidst fair one day to be more exalted." Had well, it was exceeding pleasant, by St. Thomas!<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Well, Barbara, and how fares father?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>He has done nought but chide, since you disappear'd, Samson. It has sour'd him with us all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Well, I will call, soon, and set all even.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>Will yuo, brother?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>I will. Bid him not be cast down. I will protect the Rawbold family.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>Truly, brother, we are much in need of protection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Do not fear. Lean upon my power. I am head of all the male domesticks, at Madam Helen's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>O, the father! of all! and how many be there, brother?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Why, truly, not so many as there be at the Lodge, here. But I have a boy under me, to chop wood, and draw water.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>The money we had from Sir Edward's bounty, is nearly gone in payment of the debt our father owed. You know he had shortly been imprison'd, else.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="69" facs="95"/>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>My stock is somewhat low, too.—But, no matter. Keep a good heart. I am now a rising man. I will make you all comfortable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>Heaven bless you, Samson!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>In three months, I look for a quarter's wages; and then Dick shall have a shirt. I must now take you roundly to task.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>Me, brother!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Aye, marry. You would throw yourself away on this Wilford—who▪ as the story goes, is little better than the devil's own imp.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>O, brother! be not so uncharitable. I know not what is against him, but he has not been heard yet. Consider too—were all our actions, at home, to be sifted, I fear me, we might not escape blameless.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Aye, but he, it seems, is falling, and we are upon the rise; and that makes all the difference. Mass! how gingerly men will sift the faults of those who are getting up hill in the world; and what a rough shake they give those who are going downward!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>I would not be one of those sisters, brother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>No,—I warrant, now, thou wouldst marry this vagabond.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>That I would, brother. He has cheer'd me in my distress, and I would sooner die than leave him, now he is unfortunate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sams.</speaker>
<p>Hast thou no respect for the family? Thou wilt bring endless disgrace on the name of Rawbold. Shame on you! to take away from our reputation, when we have so little!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>I thought, brother, you would have shewn more pity for your poor sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Tush! Love's a mere vapour.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hel.</speaker>
<l>I'll mimick the physician—wise and dull—</l>
<l>With cane at nose, and nod emphatical,</l>
<l>Portentous in my silence; feel your pulse,</l>
<l>With an owl's face, that shall express as much</l>
<l>As Galen's head, cut out in wood, and gilt,</l>
<l>Stuck over an apothecary's door.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<p>And what wouldst thou prescribe?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hel.</speaker>
<l>I would distil</l>
<l>Each flower that lavish happiness produced.</l>
<l>Through the world's paradise, ere Disobedience</l>
<l>Scatter'd the seeds of care; then mingle each,</l>
<l>In one huge cup of comfort for thee, love,</l>
<l>To chase away thy dulness. Thou shouldst wanton</l>
<l>Upon the wings of Time, and mock his flight,</l>
<l>As he sail'd with thee tow'rd Eternity.</l>
<l>I'd have each hour, each minute of thy life,</l>
<l>A golden holiday; and should a cloud</l>
<l>O'ercast thee, be it light as a gossamer,</l>
<l>That Helen might disperse it with a breath,</l>
<l>And talk thee into sunshine!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Sweet, sweet Helen!</l>
<l>Death, soften'd with thy voice, might dull his sting,</l>
<l>And steep his darts in balsam. Oh! my Helen,</l>
<l>These warnings which that grisly monarch sends,</l>
<l>Forerunners of his certain visitation,</l>
<l><pb n="72" facs="98"/>Of late are frequent with me. It should seem</l>

<l>My Mortimer! You—Oh! for heaven's sake,</l>

<p>Think on thee, Helen?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hel.</speaker>
<l>Aye: but not think thus.</l>

<l>In the most trying struggle.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Said I so?</l>
<l>Yet, Helen, when my fancy paints a death-bed,</l>
<l>I ever place thee foremost in the scene,</l>
<l>To make the picture touching. After man</l>
<l>Is summon'd, and has made up his account,</l>
<l>Oh! 'tis a bitter after-reck'ning, when</l>
<l>His pallid lips receive the last, sad kiss,</l>
<l>Fond, female anguish prints! Then, Helen, then,</l>
<l>Then comes man's agony! To leave the object</l>
<l>He shelter'd in his heart, grief-struck and helpless;</l>
<l>To grasp her hand; to fix his hollow eye</l>
<l>Upon her face, and mark her mute despair,</l>
<l>'Till the last flutter of his aching spirit</l>
<l>Hurries him hence, for ever!</l>

<l>I would not pain you thus, for worlds!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Nay, come;</l>
<l>I meant not this▪ I did not mean to say</l>
<l>There's danger now; but 'tis the privilege</l>
<l>Of sickness to be grave, and moralize</l>
<l>On that which sickness brings. I prithee, now,</l>
<l>Be comforted. Believe me, I shall mend.</l>
<l>I feel I shall already.</l>

<l>I'll play the nurse to-day—and then, to-morrow,</l>
<l>You shall not brood at home, as you are wont,</l>
<l>But we will ride together, through the forest.</l>
<l>You must have exercise. Oh! I will make you</l>

<l>To scald and weigh it down. Believe me, love,</l>

<p>I was unfit to serve him, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<p>Unfit!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<l>I was unhappy, Sir. I fled a house</l>
<l>Where certain misery awaited me,</l>
<l>While I was doom'd to dwell in't.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>Misery!</l>
<l>What was this certain misery?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<l>Your pardon,—</l>
<l>I never will divulge.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<l>No, never.</l>
<l>Pray do not press me. All that I can say</l>
<l>Is, that I have a strong, and rooted reason,</l>
<l>Which has resolved me. 'Twere impossible</l>
<l>I should be tranquil here. I feel it, Sir,</l>
<l>A duty to myself to quit this roof.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>Harkye, young man. This smacks of mystery;</l>
<l>And now looks foully. Truth, and Innocence,</l>
<l>Walk round the world in native nakedness.</l>
<l>But guilt is cloak'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<l>Whate'er the prejudice</l>
<l>My conduct conjures up, I must submit.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>'Twere better now you conjured up your friends:</l>
<l><pb n="82" facs="108"/>For I must tell you—No, there is no need.</l>
<l>You learn'd it, doubtless, on the way, and know</l>
<l>The danger you, now, stand in.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<l>Danger, Sir!</l>
<l>What? How? I have learn'd nothing, Sir; my guides</l>
<l>Drag'd me in silence hither.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>Then 'tis fit</l>
<l>I put you on your guard. It grieves me, Wilford,</l>
<l>To say there is a heavy charge against you,</l>
<l>Which, as I gather, may affect your life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Mine!—O, good Heaven!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>Pray be calm:—for, soon,</l>
<l>Here, in the face of all his family,</l>
<l>My brother will accuse you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<l>He!—What, He!</l>
<l>He accuse me! O monstrous! O, look down</l>
<l>You who can read mens hearts!—A charge against me!</l>
<l>Ha! ha! I'm innocent! I'm innocent!<stage>much agitatated</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<p>Collect your firmness. You will need it all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<l>I shall, indeed! I pray you tell me, Sir,</l>
<l>What is the charge?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>I do not know its purport.</l>
<l>I would not hear on't: for on my voice rests</l>
<l>The issue of this business;—and a judge</l>
<l>Should come unbiass'd to his office. Wilford,</l>
<l>Were twenty brothers waiting my award,</l>
<l>You should have even, and impartial justice.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>O, you are just! I would all men were so!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>I hope most men are so. Rally your thoughts.</l>
<l>When you are call'd upon! if truth will serve you,</l>
<l>Sketch out your story with her chaste, bold pencil;</l>
<l>If truth should fail you, Wilford, even take</l>
<l>The fairest colour human art can mix,</l>
<l>To give a glow to plausibility.</l>
<l>Tis self-defence; and 'tis allow'd, when man</l>
<l>Must battle it, with all the world against him.</l>
<l><pb n="83" facs="109"/>—Heaven bless you, boy!—that is, I mean— pshaw! plague!</l>
<l>—Farewell! and may you prosper?<stage>Exit.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Then, all my youthful hopes are blighted in the bud! The breath of my powerful persecutor will wither them. Let me recall my actions.—My breast is unclog'd with crime. This charge is to be open;—in the eye of the world; of the laws —Then, why should I fear? I am native of a happy soil where justice guards equally the life of its poorest and richest inhabitant. Let him inflict his menaces upon me, in secret; Let him torture my mind and body; he shall not, cannot, touch my good name.</p>

<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>Wounded you!</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>And, was it so! was it so, Wilford?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Aye, Barbara. When I was drag'd hither, the whole troop escaped, or they had vouch'd for the truth on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Barb.</speaker>
<p>I would they had not escaped. For all here say that you had fled to join them.</p>

<p>Here's a chair, your worship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>No matter.—To our business, brother Wilford,</l>
<l>You may well guess the struggle I endure</l>
<l>To place you here the mark of accusation.</l>
<l>I gave you ample warning: Caution'd you,</l>
<l>When many might have scourged: and, even now,</l>
<l>While I stand here to crush you,—aye, to crush you,—</l>
<l>My heart bleeds drops of pity for your youth,</l>
<l>Whose rashness plucks the red destruction down,</l>
<l>And pulls the bolt upon you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<l>You know best</l>
<l>The movements of your heart, sir. Man is blind,</l>
<l>And cannot read them: but there is a Judge,</l>
<l>To whose all seeing eye our inmost thoughts</l>
<l>Lye open. Think to him you, now, appeal.—</l>
<l>Omniscience keeps heaven's register;</l>
<l>And, soon or late, when Time unfolds the book,</l>
<l>Our trembling souls must answer to the record,</l>
<l>And meet their due reward or punishment.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<p>Now, to the point, I pray you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Thus it is, then.</l>

<l>How ground you this suspicion!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Briefly, thus.——</l>
<l>You may have noticed, in my library,</l>
<l>A chest <stage>Wilford starts</stage>—You see he changes at the word.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>And well I may!<stage>aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Where I have told you, brother,</l>
<l>The writings which concern our family,</l>
<l>With jewels, cash, and other articles,</l>
<l>Of no mean value, were deposited.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<p>You oftentimes have said so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Yesterday,</l>
<l>Chance call'd me, suddenly away: I left</l>
<l>The key in't—but as suddenly return'd;</l>
<l>And found this Wilford, this young man, whose state,</l>
<l>Whose orphan state, met pity in my house,</l>
<l>'Till pity grew to friendship,—him I found,</l>
<l>Fix'd o'er the chest, upon his knees, intent,</l>
<l>As, now, I think, on plunder; tinging theft</l>
<l>Still blacker with ingratitude; and rifling</l>
<l>The easy fool who shelter'd him. Confusion</l>
<l>Shook his young joints, as he let fall the lid,</l>
<l>And gave me back the key.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>Did you not search</l>
<l>Your papers on the instant?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>No:—for, first,</l>
<l>(Habit so long had fix'd my confidence)</l>
<l>I deem'd it boyish curiosity;—</l>
<l>But told him this would meet my further question:</l>
<l>And, at that moment, came a servant in,</l>
<l>To say you were arrived. He must have mark'd</l>
<l>Our mix'd emotion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<p>Is that servant here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Servant.</speaker>
<p>'Twas I, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Was it you? Well, saw you aught</l>
<l>To challenge your attention?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Servant.</speaker>
<l>Sir, I did.</l>
<l>Wilford was pale and trembling; and our master</l>
<l>Gave him a look as if 'twould pierce him through;</l>
<l><pb n="88" facs="114"/>And cried, "Remember."—Then he trembled more,</l>
<l>And we both quitted him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>When first we met,</l>
<l>You found me somewhat ruffled.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<p>'Tis most true.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>But somewhat more when, afterwards, I saw</l>
<l>Wilford conversing with you—like a snake,</l>
<l>Sun'd by your looks, and basking in your favour.</l>
<l>I bade him quit the room, with indignation,</l>
<l>And wait my coming in the library.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<p>I witness'd that, with wonder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>O, good brother!</l>
<l>You little thought, while you so gently school'd me,</l>
<l>In the full flow of your benevolence,</l>
<l>For my harsh bearing tow'rd him, on what ground</l>
<l>That harshness rested. I had made my search,</l>
<l>In the brief interval of absence from you,</l>
<l>And found my property had vanish'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>We'll—</l>
<l>You met him in the library?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>O never</l>
<l>Can he forget that solemn interview!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>Aye, speak to that:—it was a solemn interview.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Observe, he does acknowledge that we met▪</l>
<l>Guilt was my theme:—he cannot now deny it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>It was a theme of—No. <stage>checking himself.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>He pleaded innocence:</l>
<l>While every word he spake belied his features,</l>
<l>And mock'd his protestation. I restrain'd</l>
<l>The chastisement he fear'd; nor wou'd I blazon</l>
<l>The wrong I could not fix; and subject, thus,</l>
<l>By general inquiry, all the guiltless</l>
<l>To foul suspicion. That suspicion lay</l>
<l>Most heavily on him; but the big cloud</l>
<l>Of anger he had gather'd burst not on him,</l>
<l>In vengeance to o'erwhelm him: chill it drop'd,</l>
<l>But kindly, as the dew, in admonition;</l>
<l><pb n="89" facs="115"/>Like tears of fathers o'er a wayward child,</l>
<l>When love enforces them to ruggedness.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<p>What said you to him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>"Regulate your life,</l>
<l>"In future, better. I, now, spare your youth;</l>
<l>"But dare not to proceed. All I exact,</l>
<l>"('Tis a soft penance)—that you tarry here,</l>
<l>"My eye your guard, my house your gentle prison,</l>
<l>"My bounty be your chains. Attempt not flight;</l>
<l>"Flight ripens all my doubt to certainty,</l>
<l>"And justice to the world unlocks my tongue."—</l>
<l>He fled, and I arraign him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>Trust me, brother,</l>
<l>This charge is staggering. Yet accidents</l>
<l>Sometimes combine to cast a shade of doubt</l>
<l>Upon the innocent. May it be so here!</l>
<l>Here is his trunk: 'twas brought here at my order.</l>
<l>'Tis fit that it be search'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>O, that were needless.</l>
<l>He were a shallow villain that would trust</l>
<l>His freight of plunder to so frail a bottom.</l>
<l>School-boys, who strip the orchard of its fruit,</l>
<l>Conceal their thievery better.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>Yet 'tis found,</l>
<l>Such negligence is often link'd with guilt.</l>
<l>—Take not—I say not yet that he is guilty,</l>
<l>But scarce heard of crafty villain, yet,</l>
<l>Who did not make some blot in his foul game,</l>
<l>That lookers-on have thought him blind, and mad,</l>
<l>It was so palpable.—'Tis rarely otherwise:</l>

<l>I could say much, but must not.—No, I will not.</l>
<l>Do as you please.—I have no friend—no witness,</l>
<l>Save my accuser. Did he not—pray ask him—</l>
<l>Did he not vaunt his wiles could ruin me?</l>
<l>Did he not menace, in his pride of power,</l>
<l>To blast my name, and crush my innocence?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<p>What do you answer, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>I answer—No.—</l>
<l>More were superflous, when a criminal</l>
<l>Opposes empty volubility.</l>
<l>To circumstantial charge. A stedfast brow</l>
<l>Repels not fact, nor can invalidate</l>
<l>These dumb, but damning, witnesses, before him.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<l>By the just Pow'r that rules us, I am ignorant</l>
<l>How they came there!—but 'tis my firm belief,</l>
<l>You placed them there, to sink me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>O, too much!</l>
<l>You steel men's hearts against you! Death and shame!</l>
<l>It rouses honest choler. Call the officers.—</l>
<l>He shall meet punishment. <stage>Servants going.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>Hold! pray you, hold.</l>
<l>Justice has, thus far, struggled with my pity,</l>
<l>To do an act of duty to the world.</l>
<l>I would unmask a hypocrite; lay bare</l>
<l>The front of guilt, that men may see and shun it:</l>
<l><pb n="92" facs="118"/>'Tis done—And I will, now, proceed no further.</l>
<l>I would not hurt the serpent, but to make</l>
<l>The serpent hurtless. He has lost his sting.</l>
<l>Let him depart, and freely.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>Lookye, brother.</l>
<l>This shall not be.—Had he proved innocent,</l>
<l>My friendship had been doubled; you well know</l>
<l>I have been partial to him—but this act</l>
<l>Is so begrimed with black, ungrateful malice,</l>
<l>That I insist on justice. Fly, knaves! run,</l>
<l>And let him be secured. <stage>Exeunt servants.</stage> You tarry here <stage>to Wilford.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<p>I will not have it thus.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>You must—You shall—</l>
<l>'Tis weak else. Oons! I trust I have as much</l>
<l>Of good, straight-forward pity, as may serve;</l>
<l>But, to turn dove—to sit still, and be peck'd at,</l>
<l>It is too tame. His insolence tops all!</l>
<l>Does not this rouse you, too?—Look on these jewels.—</l>
<l>Look at this picture.—'Twas our mother's: Stay,</l>
<l>Let me inspect this nearer. What are here?</l>
<l>Parchments— <stage>inspecting the trunk.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<l>O, look no further.—They are deeds,</l>
<l>Which, in his haste, no doubt he crowded there,</l>
<l>Not knowing what—to look o'er at his leisure—</l>
<l>Family deeds—They all were in my chest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
<p>O, 'tis deep laid!—These, too, to give a colour!<stage>aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fitz.</speaker>
<l>What have we here? I have your leave, good brother,</l>
<l>As arbiter in this. Here is a paper</l>
<l>Of curious enfolding—slipt, as 'twere</l>
<l>By chance, within another. This may be</l>
<l>Of note upon his trial.—What's this drops?</l>

<l>I will speak—Soon I will—a little yet—</l>

<l>Well, I will—</l>
<l>I will be firm. One struggle, and 'tis over.</l>
<l>I have most foully wrong'd you! Ere I die—</l>
<l>And I feel death-struck—let me haste to make</l>
<l>Atonement.—Brother, note. The jewels,</l>
<l>Yes, and that paper—Heaven and accident</l>
<l>Ordain'd it so!—were placed—Curse on my flesh,</l>

<p>O, mercy on me!</p>

<l>More. I feared this boy;</l>
<l>He knew my secret; and I blacken'd him,</l>
<l>That, should he e'er divulge the fatal story,</l>
<l>His word might meet no credit. Infamy</l>
<l>Will brand my mem'ry for't: Posterity,</l>
<l>Whose breath I made my god, will keep my shame</l>
<l>Green in her damning record. Oh! I had—</l>
<l>I had a heart o'erflowing with good thoughts</l>
<l>For all mankind! One fatal, fatal turn,</l>
<l>Has poison'd all! Where is my honour, now?</l>
<l>To die!—To have my ashes trampled on,</l>

<p>Peace, peace, I pray you. Our master is taken ill: So ill, my fellows, that I fear me he stands in much danger. That you rejoice in my acquittal, I perceive, and thank you. Sir Edward's brother will explain further to you: I cannot. But believe this:—Heaven, to whose eye the dark movements of guilt are manifest, will ever watch over,
<pb n="96" facs="122"/>
and succour the innocent, in their extremity. Clamour not now your congratulations to me, I entreat you: Rather, let the slow, still voice of gratitude be lifted up to Providence, for that care she ever bestows upon those deserving her protection!</p>
