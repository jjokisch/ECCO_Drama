<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THE following PROLOGUE was Spoken to the Dramatic Pastoral, called the <hi>Winter</hi>'s <hi>Tale,</hi> and this Comedy; both of which are altered from <hi>Shakespear,</hi> and were perform'd the same Night.</p>
<p>Some of the Lines of the PROLOGUE are only relative to the <hi>Winter's Tale,</hi> yet as the Publication of that Pastoral is defer'd for some Time, and as the PROLOGUE has been particularly desir'd, it is hop'd that it will not be disagreeable to the Reader to see it prefix'd to this Comedy.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE TO THE WINTER's TALE. AND CATHARINE and PETRUCHIO. (Both from SHAKESPEAR.)</head>
<byline>Written and Spoken by Mr. <hi>GARRICK.</hi></byline>
<lg>
<l>TO various Things the Stage has been compar'd,</l>
<l>As apt Ideas strike each humorous Bard:</l>
<l>This Night, for want of better Simile,</l>
<l>Let this our <hi>Theatre</hi> a <hi>Tavern</hi> be:</l>
<l>The Poets Vintners, and the Waiters we.</l>
<l>So as the Cant, and Custom of the Trade is,</l>
<l><hi>You're welcome</hi> Gem'min, <hi>kindly welcome Ladies.</hi></l>
<l>To draw in Customers, our <hi>Bills</hi> are spread,</l>
<l>You cannot miss the Sign, 'tis <hi>Shakespear's Head.</hi></l>
<l>From this same Head, this Fountain-head divine,</l>
<l>For different Palates springs a different Wine!</l>
<l>In which no Tricks, to strengthen, or to thin 'em—</l>
<l>Neat as imported—no <hi>French</hi> Brandy in em'—</l>
<l>Hence for the choicest Spirits flow <hi>Champaign</hi>;</l>
<l>Whose sparkling Atoms shoot thro' every Vein,</l>
<l>Then mount in Magic Vapours to th' enraptur'd Brain!</l>
<l>Hence flow for martial Minds Potations strong;</l>
<l>And sweet Love Potions, for the Fair and Young.</l>
<l>For you my Hearts of Oak, for your Regale, <stage>[To the Upper Gallery</stage></l>
<l>There's good old <hi>English Stingo,</hi> mild and stale.</l>
<l>For high, luxurious Sculs with luscious Smack,</l>
<l>There's <hi>Sir John Falstaff,</hi> is a Butt of Sack:</l>
<l>And if the stronger Liquors more invite ye;</l>
<l><hi>Bardolph</hi> is Gin, and <hi>Pistol</hi> Aqua Vitae.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But shou'd you call for <hi>Falstaff,</hi> where to find him,</l>
<l>He's gone—nor left one Cup of Sack behind him.</l>
<l><pb facs="5"/>
Sunk in his Elbow-Chair, no more he'll roam;</l>
<l>No more, with merry Wags, to <hi>Eastcheap</hi> come;</l>
<l>He's gone,—to jest, and laugh, and give his Sack at Home.</l>
<l>As for the learned Critics, grave and deep,</l>
<l>Who catch at Words, and catching fall asleep;</l>
<l>Who in the Storms of Passion—hum,—and haw!</l>
<l>For such, our Master will no Liquor draw—</l>
<l>So blindly thoughtful, and so darkly read,</l>
<l>They take <hi>Tom Durffy</hi>'s, for the <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s Head.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>A Vintner once acquir'd both Praise and Gain,</l>
<l>And sold much <hi>Perry</hi> for the best <hi>Champaign.</hi></l>
<l>Some Rakes, this precious Stuff did so allure;</l>
<l>They drank whole Nights—what's that—when Wine is pure?</l>
<l>" Come fill a Bumper, <hi>Jack</hi>—, I will my Lord—</l>
<l>" Here's Cream!—Damn'd fine!—immense!—upon my Word!"</l>
<l>Sir <hi>William,</hi> what say you?—The best, believe me—</l>
<l>In this—Eh <hi>Jack!</hi>—the Devil can't deceive me.</l>
<l>Thus the wise Critic too, mistakes his Wine,</l>
<l>Cries out with lifted Hands, 'tis great!—Divine!</l>
<l>Then jogs his Neighbour, as the Wonders strike him;</l>
<l>This <hi>Shakespear! Shakespear!</hi>—oh there's nothing like him!</l>
<l>In this Night's various, and enchanted Cup,</l>
<l>Some little <hi>Perry</hi>'s mixt for filling up.</l>
<l>The Five long Acts, from which our Three are taken,</l>
<l>Stretch'd out to <note n="*" place="foot">The Action of the <hi>Winter</hi>'s <hi>Tale,</hi> as written by <hi>Shakespear,</hi> comprehends Sixteen Years.</note> sixteen Years, lay by, forsaken.</l>
<l>Lest then this precious Liquor run to waste,</l>
<l>'Tis now consin'd and bottled for your Taste.</l>
<l>'Tis my chief Wish, my Joy, my only Plan,</l>
<l>To lose no <hi>Drop</hi> of that immortal Man!</l>

<l><seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HUS have I, 'gainst my own Self-Interest,</l>
<l>Repeated all the worst you are t'expect</l>
<l>From my shrewd Daughter, <hi>Cath'rine</hi>; if you'll venture,</l>
<l>Maugre my plain and honest Declaration,</l>
<l>You have my free Consent, win her, and wed her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Signior <hi>Baptista,</hi> thus it stands with me.</l>
<l><hi>Anthonio,</hi> my Father, is deceased:</l>
<l>You knew him well, and knowing him, know me,</l>
<l>Left solely Heir to all his Lands and Goods,</l>
<l>Which I have better'd, rather than decreas'd.</l>
<l>And I have thrust myself into the World,</l>
<l>Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:</l>
<l>My Business asketh Haste, old Signior,</l>
<l>And ev'ry Day I cannot come to wooe.</l>
<l>Let Specialties be therefore drawn between us,</l>
<l>That Cov'nants may be kept on either Hand.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>Yes, when the special Thing is well obtain'd,</l>
<l>My Daughter's Love, for that is all in all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, Father,</l>
<l>I am as peremptory, as she proud-minded;</l>
<l>And where two raging Fires meet together,</l>
<l>They do consume the Thing that feeds their Fury.</l>
<l>Tho' little Fire grows great with little Wind,</l>
<l>Yet extreme Gusts will blow out Fire and all;</l>
<l>So I to her, and so she yields to me;</l>
<l>For I am rough, and wooe not like a Babe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUMIO.</speaker>
<p>Nay, look you, Sir, he tells you flatly what his Mind is: Why give him Gold enough and marry him to a Puppet, or an old Trot with ne'er a Tooth in her Head. Tho' she have as many Diseases as two and fifty Horses; why nothing comes amiss, so Money comes withal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>As I have shew'd you, Sir, the coarser Side,</l>
<l>Now let me tell you she is young and beauteous,</l>
<l>Brought up as best becomes a Gentlewoman;</l>
<l>Her only Fault (and that is Fault enough)</l>
<l>Is that she is intolerably froward;</l>
<l>If that you can away with, she is yours.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUMIO.</speaker>
<p>I pray you, Sir, let him see her while the Humour lasts. O'my Word an' she knew him as well as I do, she would think Scolding would do little Good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a Score Knaves, or so; why, that's nothing; an' he begin once, she'll find her Match. I'll tell you what, Sir, an' she stand him but a little, he will throw a Figure in her Face, and so disfigure her with it, that she shall have no more Eyes to see withal than a Cat—You know him not, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>And will you woo her, Sir?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Why came I hither but to that Intent?</l>
<l>Think you a little Din can daunt my Ears?</l>
<l>Have I not, in my Time, heard Lions roar?</l>
<l>Have I not heard the Sea puff'd up with Winds?</l>
<l>Have I not heard great Ord'nance in the Field?</l>
<l>And Heav'n's Artillery thunder in the Skies?</l>
<l>Have I not in a pitched Battle heard</l>
<l>Loud 'Larums, neighing Steeds, and Trumpets clangue?</l>
<l>And do you tell me of a Woman's Tongue;</l>
<l>That gives not half so great a Blow to hear,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="10"/>
As will a Chesnut in a Farmer's Fire;</l>
<l>Tush, tush! scare Boys with Bugs.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>Then thou'rt the Man,</l>
<l>The Man for <hi>Cath'rine,</hi> and her Father too:</l>
<l>That shall she know, and know my Mind at once.</l>
<l>I'll portion her above her gentler Sister,</l>
<l>New-married to <hi>Hortensio:</hi></l>
<l>And if with scurril Taunt, and squeamish Pride,</l>
<l>She make a Mouth, and will not taste her Fortune,</l>
<l>I'll turn her sorth to seek it in the World;</l>
<l>Nor henceforth shall she know her Father's Doors.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Say'st thou me so? Then as your Daughter, Signior,</l>
<l>Is rich enough to be <hi>Petruchio</hi>'s Wife;</l>
<l>Be she as curst as <hi>Socrates' Zantippe,</hi></l>
<l>She moves me not a Whit—Were she as rough,</l>
<l>As are the swelling <hi>Adriatick</hi> Seas,</l>
<l>I come to wive it wealthily in <hi>Padua</hi>;</l>
<l>If wealthily, then happily in <hi>Padua.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>Well may'st thou wooe, and happy be thy Speed;</l>
<l>But be thou arm'd for some unhappy Words.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>

<sp>
<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>Oh, nothing; this is nothing—</l>
<l>My Daughter <hi>Catharine,</hi> and her Music-master;</l>
<l>This is the third I've had within this Month:</l>

<l>How now, Friend, why dost look so pale?</l>

<l>For Fear, I promise you, if I do look pale.</l>

<l>What, will my Daughter prove a good Musician?</l>

<l>Iron may hold with her, but never Lutes.</l>

<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>Why, then, thou canst not break her to the Lute?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUSIC-MASTER.</speaker>
<l>Why, no; for she hath broke the Lute to me.</l>
<l>I did but tell her she mistook her Frets,</l>
<l>And bow'd her Hand, to teach her fingering,</l>
<l>When with a most impatient devilish Spirit,</l>
<l>Frets call you them? quoth she, I'll fret your Fool's Cap:</l>
<l>And with that Word, she struck me on the Head,</l>
<l>And through the Instrument my Pate made way,</l>
<l>And there I stood amazed for awhile,</l>
<l>As on a Pillory, looking thro' the Lute:</l>
<l>While she did call me Rascal-fidler,</l>
<l>And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile Terms,</l>
<l>As she had studied to misuse me so.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Now by the World, it is a lusty Wench,</l>
<l>I love her ten times more than e'er I did;</l>

<speaker>MUSIC-MASTER.</speaker>
<l>I wou'd not make another Trial with her,</l>
<l>To purchase <hi>Padua</hi>; for what is past,</l>
<l>I'm paid sufficiently: If at your Leisure,</l>
<l>You think my broken Fortunes, Head and Lute</l>

Spavins, raied with the Yellows, past Cure of the Fives, stark spoiled with the Staggers, be-gnawn with the Bots, waid in the Back, and Shoulder shotten, near legg'd before, and with a half check'd Bit; and a Head-stall of Sheep-leather, which being restrained, to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst, and now repaired with Knots, one girt six Times piec'd, and a Woman's Crupper of Velure, which hath two Letters for her Name, fairly set down in Studs, and here and there piec'd with Pack-thread.</p>

<l>I love thee well, in that thou lik'st it not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CATHARINE.</speaker>
<l>Love me, or love me not, I like the Cap,</l>
<l>And I will have it, or I will have none.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Thy Gown? why aye; come, Taylor, let me see't.</l>
<l>O Mercy Heav'n! what masking Stuff is here?</l>
<l>What's this, a Sleeve? 'Tis like a Demi-canon;</l>
<l>What up and down, carv'd like an Apple-tart!</l>
<l>Here's snip, and nip, and cut, and slish, and slash,</l>
<l>Like to a Censer in a Barber's Shop.</l>
<l>Why, what the Devil's Name, Taylor, call'st thou this?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUMIO.</speaker>
<l>I see she's like to've neither Cap nor Gown.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAYLOR.</speaker>
<l>You bid me make it orderly and well,</l>
<l>According to the Fashion of the Time.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Marry and did: but if you be remember'd,</l>
<l>I did not bid you marr it to the Time.</l>
<l>Go, hop me over every Kennel home;</l>
<l>For you shall hop without my Custom, Sir:</l>
<l>I'll none of it; hence, make your best of it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CATHARINE.</speaker>
<l>I never saw a better fashion'd Gown,</l>
<l>More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:</l>
<l>Belike you mean to make a Puppet of me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="46" facs="52"/>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Why, true; he means to make a Puppet of thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAYLOR.</speaker>
<l>She says your Worship means to make a Puppet of her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Oh! most monstrous Arrogance!</l>
<l>Thou lyest, thou Thread, thou Thimble,</l>
<l>Thou Yard, Three-quarters, Half-yard, Quarter, Nail.</l>
<l>Thou Flea, thou Nit, thou Winter-cricket, thou!</l>
<l>Brav'd in mine own House, with a Skein of Thread!</l>
<l>Away thou Rag! thou Quantity, thou Remnant,</l>
<l>Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy Yard,</l>
<l>As thou shall think on prating whilst thou liv'st:</l>
<l>I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd the Gown.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAYLOR.</speaker>
<p>Your Worship is deceiv'd, the Gown is made just as my Master had Direction; <hi>Grumio</hi> gave Order how it should be done.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUMIO.</speaker>
<l>I gave him no Order, I gave him the Stuff.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAYLOR.</speaker>
<l>But how did you desire it should be made?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="47" facs="53"/>
<speaker>GRUMIO.</speaker>
<l>Marry, Sir, with a Needle and Thread.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAYLOR.</speaker>
<l>But did you not request to have it cut?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUMIO.</speaker>
<p>Tho' thou hast fac'd many Things, face not me: I say unto thee, I bid thy Master cut the Gown, but I did not bid him cut it to Pieces. <hi>Ergo,</hi> thou liest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAYLOR.</speaker>
<l>Why, here is the Note of the Fashion to testify.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Read it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAYLOR.</speaker>
<l><hi>Imprimis,</hi> a loose-bodied Gown.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUMIO.</speaker>
<p>Master, if ever I said a loose-bodied Gown, few me up in the Skirts of it, and beat me to death with a Bottom of brown Thread: I said a Gown.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUMIO.</speaker>
<l>I confess two Sleeves.</l>

<speaker>TAYLOR.</speaker>
<l>The Sleeves curiously cut.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Ay, there's the Villany.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUMIO.</speaker>
<p>Error i'th' Bill, Sir; Error i'th' Bill; I commanded the Sleeves should be cut out, and sow'd upon again, and that I'll prove upon thee, tho' thy little Finger be arm'd in a Thimble.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAYLOR.</speaker>
<p>This is true that I say; an' I had thee in a Place thou shoud'dst know it.</p>

<p>I am for thee, straight: come on you Parchment Shred!</p>
<stage>[They fight.</stage>

<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Well, come, my <hi>Kate</hi>; we will unto your Father's,</l>
<l>Even in these honest, mean Habiliments:</l>
<l>Our Purses shall be proud, our Garments poor;</l>
<l>For 'tis the Mind that makes the Body rich;</l>
<l>And as the Sun breaks through the darkest Cloud,</l>
<l>So Honour peereth in the meanest Habit.</l>
<l>What, is the Jay more precious than the Lark,</l>
<l>Because his Feathers are more beautiful?</l>
<l>Or is the Adder better than the Eel,</l>
<l>Because his painted Skin contents the Eye?</l>
<l>Oh no, good <hi>Kate</hi>; neither art thou the worse</l>
<l>For this poor Furniture, and mean Array.</l>
<l>If thou accounts't it Shame, lay it on me;</l>
<l>And therefore frolick; we will hence, forthwith.</l>
<l>To feast and sport us at thy Father's House:</l>
<l>Go call my Men, and bring our Horses out.</l>

<speaker>CATHARINE.</speaker>
<l>O happy Hearing! Let us strait be gone;</l>
<l>I cannot tarry here another Day.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Cannot, my <hi>Kate!</hi> O fie! indeed you can—</l>
<l>Besides, on second Thoughts, 'tis now too late,</l>
<l>For, look, how bright and goodly shines the Moon.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="50" facs="56"/>
<speaker>CATHARINE.</speaker>
<l>The Moon! the Sun; it is not Moon-light now.</l>

<l>I say it is the Moon that shines so bright.</l>

<l>I say it is the Sun that shines so bright.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Now, by my Mother's Son, and that's myself;</l>
<l>It shall be Moon, or Star; or what I list,</l>
<l>Or e're I Journey to your Father's House:</l>
<l>Go on, and fetch our Horses back again;</l>
<l>Evermore crost, and crost; nothing but crost!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>GRUMIO.</speaker>
<l>Say as he says, or we shall never go.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CATHARINE.</speaker>
<l>I see 'tis vain to struggle with my Bonds;</l>
<l>So be it Moon, or Sun, or what you please;</l>
<l>And if you please to call it a Rush Candle,</l>
<l>Henceforth I vow, it shall be so for me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>I say it is the Moon.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>CATHARINE.</speaker>
<l>I know it is the Moon.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>PETRUCHIO.</speaker>
<l>Nay, then you lye; it is the blessed Sun.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="51" facs="57"/>
<speaker>CATHARINE.</speaker>
<l>Just as you please, it is the blessed Sun;</l>
<l>But Sun it is not, when you say it is not;</l>

<sp>

<speaker>CATHARINE.</speaker>
<l>Thy Husband is thy Lord, thy Life, thy Keeper,</l>
<l>Thy Head, thy Sovereign; one that cares for thee,</l>

<l>To painful Labour, both by Sea and Land,</l>
<l>To watch the Night in Storms, the Day in Cold,</l>
<l>While thou ly'st warm at home, secure and safe;</l>
<l>And craves no other Tribute at thy Hands,</l>

<l>Such Duty as the Subject owes the Prince,</l>

<l>And not obedient to his honest Will;</l>
<l>What is she but a foul contending Rebel,</l>
<l>And graceless Traitor to her loving Lord?</l>
<l>How shameful 'tis when Women are so simple</l>
<l>To offer War where they should kneel for Peace;</l>
<l>Or seek for Rule, Supremacy and Sway,</l>
<l>Where bound to love, to honour and obey.</l>
