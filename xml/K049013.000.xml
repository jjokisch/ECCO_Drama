<p>JOANNA OF MONTFAUCON; A DRAMATIC ROMANCE OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY: AS PERFORMED AT THE Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden. FORMED UPON THE PLAN OF THE GERMAN DRAMA OF KOTZEBUE: AND ADAPTED TO THE ENGLISH STAGE BY RICHARD CUMBERLAND.</p>

<head>TO THE READER.</head>
<p>THE German original of this Play, which its Author stiles 'a Dramatic Romance of the fourteenth century,' has not, I believe, as yet been published. It never came under my inspection; and, if it had, I could have made no use of it, not understanding a syllable of the language.</p>
<p>The model, upon which I worked was an English translation, that professed nothing more than fidelity to the words of the author, and this I have no doubt it correctly performed. In this copy I discovered the frame-work of what might be made a splendid spectacle; and the known liberality of those, in whom the property and conduct of the Theatre are
<pb n="iv" facs="4"/>
vested, has more than equalled every expectation I could ground upon their support. What else I discovered, except as above stated, it may not become me to say, for I have no right to pronounce upon an author, who composes in a language unknown to me; but certain it is, I stand responsible to the Public for every sentence in this Drama now before them, with the exception of a very few periods indeed, and those of no great importance. Let Kotzebue therefore answer for no more than belongs to him—the plot and fabric of <hi>JOANNA.</hi> Whether I have marred it or mended it in the execution, can only be decided when the Public shall be in possession of the means for comparing them.</p>
<p>It has so rarely been my habit to write upon any plot but of my own fabrication and invention, that what I assert in the Prologue is most strictly true; viz.</p>
<l>"All, who cou'd judge my labour, wou'd confess</l>
<l>"Originality had made it less."</l>
<p>Whether from inaptitude for the task, or from whatever other cause my embarrassments have
<pb n="v" facs="5"/>
proceeded, such they have been, and so many times have I woven and unwoven this Penelope's web, that if plays were only to be appreciated by the pains they cost in composing, this of mine would have a merit, which I suspect the world will not be in the humour to attach to it. Then indeed I should have one fair exception to set against the many instances of precipitation, of which I stand accused, but of which I cannot be duly convicted, till it is known of how many hours my day consists, and what portion of those I devote to my studies.</p>
<p>I have heard several authors instance a dispatch in composition, of which I have no conception; but, with respect to the drama now submitted, whether I did or did not write it, <hi>stans pede in uno,</hi> I can only assure the Public, I will never stand upon German legs any more, but take my chance with my countrymen for so much of their favour as my own independant efforts can obtain for me.</p>
<p>I have now been so often before the Reader, that I must claim the privilege of addressing him as a friend, whom I am not to flatter,
<pb n="vi" facs="6"/>
and in whose company I am not to degrade myself by an unmanly stile of supplication, assumed for no other purpose than to invoke his candour; the which, if he has not, false diffidence will not create, and, if he has, plain speaking will not offend. I therefore shall not scruple to say (speaking under the sanction of age and long experience) that the diction of Joanna is not inferior to that of any of my most favoured plays. I know I have outlived the time, when a simple and consistent fable, developed in correct and classic diction, presenting characters to be found in nature, and producing incidents not irreconcileable to probability, can no longer attract: I also perceive I have lived to see the time, when not content with the eccentricities of our own stage, we have gone to that of the Germans for fresh supplies of what we were overstocked with—false writing and false moral. It is too often that the success or failure of a play depends upon the <hi>cast,</hi> not upon the composition; of course the play is written more for the actors behind the curtain, than for the audience before it: this makes Tragedy run
<pb n="vii" facs="7"/>
riot, and Comedy play the antick. We have actors, who possess such irresistible power over the risibility of the spectator, that our writers for the stage find their account in availing themselves of those powers, and produce a species of composition, which, departing from the character of the legitimate drama, may be said to border very nearly upon farce and mummery.</p>
<p>Where fashion points, the stage will follow. If, endeavouring to write according to nature and good models, the dramatic author finds himself deserted by the Town, who but will be weary of the attempt? If the public taste is vitiated, the remedy is not with him: the critic may take up the cause; a good <hi>dramatic censor</hi> may do much, but a scurrilous one can effect nothing. Are authors only to be lashed, and their misleaders to be passed over uncorrected? The enlarged expences of our royal theatres do not warrant their proprietors in opposing themselves to the public taste—how then should authors undertake it?</p>
<p>As I have been uniformly adverse in my opinion to the introduction of these German
<pb n="viii" facs="8"/>
dramas on the English stage, it may well be supposed my reasons for undertaking to adapt this of Joanna were strong ones, and in yielding to them, I have only to regret, that my endeavours have not been more serviceable to the interests of a theatre, to which I have every obligation, not only for the fair and honourable treatment I experienced from the proprietors, but also for the warm and cordial support I received from the performers. <hi>Mr. Incledon</hi> in particular has a claim to my best acknowledgments for his very honourable and zealous perseverance in his duty, under circumstances of such an afflicting nature, as might have fully justified him for declining it.</p>
<p>In the copy now printed, I have not altogether adhered to the Prompter's book, as it was altered after the first night's representation. The Reader will observe I have retained the incident of Lazarra's falling by the hand of Joanna; this I have done, because I see no particular reason for departing so entirely from the author's first conception, though good reason obtained, in point of action, for the alteration
<pb n="ix" facs="9"/>
that was made on the second night. On the German stage, Albert, in the combat with his rival, stumbles over the root of a tree, and falls to the ground; in this instant Joanna rushes in accoutred in the complete armour of a warlike knight, and with a huge sword of two-handed sway dispatches Lazarra at a stroke. Albert, thus critically rescued, rises and requests the unknown Knight to put up his visor, when to his astonishment he discovers his preserver in the person of his wife. How they may manage these matters on the German stage I cannot pretend to say; perhaps their actors may be better duellists, and their actresses more adroit in warlike operations than ours; but if we found difficulty in the action, simplified as it is, how much more should we have been embarrassed in point of execution, had we undertaken to perform it in the spirit of the original?</p>
<p>In the concluding scene of the third act, Wensel in the original gets drunk upon the stage, and the keys are taken out of his chamber by Philip, whilst his intoxicated father
<pb n="x" facs="10"/>
lies buried in profound sleep. If what I substituted in place of this incident is not so near to nature as the original, it is certainly less offensive to decorum, and better suited to the manners of our English stage. When I am speaking of this scene (unquestionably the most prominent in the play) I cannot pass it over without acknowledging my obligations to the young and rising actor, whose energetic and impressive execution in the character of Philip gave such brilliancy to the representation, and displayed powers, which, when drawn forth by abler authors, and better opportunities, cannot fail to place him in the very highest rank of his profession.</p>
<p>The Joanna of Kotzebue is kept out of sight during the whole time that Lazarra is in possession of her castle, and of course is never before the audience but in the opening and conclusion of the play. It appeared to me expedient to fill up this <hi>hiatus,</hi> and of course her scenes in the middle acts are supplementary.</p>
<p>In like manner, Wolf in the original is
<pb n="xi" facs="11"/>
merely the shadow of a character. The support of such an actor as <hi>Mr. Munden,</hi> is an object which every author will reach at with avidity. I sincerely thank him for his cordial assistance; I wish my efforts had been more proportionate to his merit. To the performers, who condescended to appear in characters, neither adequate to their merits, nor consonant with their feelings, I have more to offer than acknowledgments; I must beg them to accept my apology.</p>
<p>As there is no music in the original, I must in justice exonerate the author from all responsibility on the score of the discarded Page. When his singing ceased, his services were no longer wanted; two songs were composed for this character, though but one was performed; these exquisite melodies will, I hope, be published by the composer; and that I may not appear to keep that out of sight, which will do him so much honour to produce, I retain those songs in my copy, and of course the whole part of Eugene.</p>
<p>The overture, chorusses, and songs, incidental
<pb n="xii" facs="12"/>
to the piece, with four symphonies between the acts, were all composed for the occasion by <hi>Mr. Thomas Busby:</hi> He also, in the run of the piece, substituted a new Quintetto instead of the Peasant's chorus in the opening scene, and at the same time withdrew the finale of Joy, Joy, Joy! and introduced upon the ninth night a shorter and most brilliant chorus to the following words:
<l>"Hail, glorious day! Death strikes our impious foe,</l>
<l>"And Victory binds her wreath on Virtue's brow."</l></p>
<p>It is matter of the highest satisfaction to me to find that the Public have done justice to his eminent abilities. I sincerely hope this his first essay in the dramatic line will encourage him to employ his talents upon a larger and more splendid scale. Where genius so sublime is combined with science so profound, what is there within the province of his studies, which the world may not expect from <hi>Mr. Busby?</hi></p>
<p>As the opposition, which was given to this play upon the first evening only of its performance, has passed over me without injury, I should have passed over it without a remark,
<pb n="xiii" facs="13"/>
but that I am given to understand an opinion was in circulation, that I had vanity enough to conceive I had prepared a spectacle, and composed a drama to rival, nay to eclipse, one that was triumphantly established on the sister stage. As an author, I have never appealed from the decisions of the theatre: conscious that nothing can be more perfectly at the mercy of the Public than an author's reputation, when he has committed it to the stage, I have never offered a single word in arrest of judgment, however rigorous, nor persisted to obtrude myself, when I had once discovered I was no longer welcome. That we had no reason to yield the play up upon the partial clamour of the first night, the event of the second clearly evinced; not a murmur was heard, and the applause was general. If I had been the arrogant man, which it is presumed I was thought to be by some of my opponents, their resentment would have fallen so much more heavily upon the liberal proprietors of the theatre, than upon me individually, that there would have been infinitely more cruelty than justice in their
<pb n="xiv" facs="14"/>
revenge. But the task of adapting this German Drama to our stage was no work of my seeking, and though I expended more pains upon it than I ever did upon any play in my life, the hopes I formed of its success were chiefly grounded on the brilliancy of the spectacle, and the excellence of the music: As for Pizarro, I envy not his success; I do not aspire to rival it, I cannot wish to lessen it; and if any man doubts my sincerity, let him put himself in the predicament of an author, for years held off from receiving the fair and moderate earnings of his productive services; and looking to that very fund for indemnification, then let him ask his conscience what he would say to such an idle imputation, and his answer shall be mine.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<l>THE Scenes that soon will open to your view,</l>
<l>In their first sketch a foreign author drew;</l>
<l>If merely tracing his inventive thought</l>
<l>We set translation's servile task at nought,</l>
<l>All who can judge our labour, must confess</l>
<l>Originality had made it less.</l>
<l>Our Dramatists you know, in every age,</l>
<l>Have copied from the French and Spanish stage:</l>
<l>We have done less—for save in plot alone,</l>
<l>The work from top to bottom is our own.</l>
<l>[<note n="*" place="foot">These four lines between brackets were not spoken.</note> "Still, if you think the British stage disgrac'd,</l>
<l>"Is it by us, or by the public taste?</l>
<l>"Let our spectators stoop to your decree,</l>
<l>"And as our masters are, such we will be."]</l>
<l>If thus tow'rds you in conscience we are clear▪</l>
<l>There's nothing from our foreign friend to fear;</l>
<l>We've given him all our care—with music's aid,</l>
<l>And painting's art, his splendid scene array'd;</l>
<l>That when his muse imperial shall be shown</l>
<l>Audience not less illustrious than her own,</l>
<l>She may not have it in her power to say,</l>
<l>A British stage disgraced a German play.</l>
<l>The Author of our plot, from married life</l>
<l>Selects his heroine, a virtuous wife!</l>
<l>This character, as fearing to advance</l>
<l>Fiction too bold, he paints as a Romance;</l>
<l>We, under no such terrors, vouch it true,</l>
<l>And for its living model point to you:</l>
<l>Asserting, you in grace and goodness show</l>
<l>All that was lovely centuries ago;</l>
<l>Conscious tho' Wives of old were more demure,</l>
<l>Your eyes may sparkle, and your hearts be pure.</l>
<l>Here we conclude, for Music now prepares</l>
<l>Her better prologue to more moving airs—</l>
<l>If knotted oaks will bend to her appeal,</l>
<l>Need she despair that hearts of oak will feel?</l>

<p>Thanks, my good people! These endearing marks of your affection are not lost upon me.

On my sick bed, when the chastising angel struck me down, and the fierce fever scorch'd my panting breast, not for myself, but for this darling child, for my dear husband, and for you my friends, I humbly pray'd the Lord of life to spare me.</p>

The stricken lyre will tremble whilst it yields exquisite music at the minstrel's touch, so through each fibre, that enfolds my heart, there is a time when even joy gives pain, and to be bless'd and prais'd by those I love, sets every nerve in motion with delight, till the sense akes with transport.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Farewell!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAZARRA.</speaker>
<p>May I not pay a pilgrim's homage here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>So! Peace be with you!</p>
</sp>
<stage>(she gives her hand, and he salutes it.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>LAZARRA.</speaker>
<stage>(aside.)</stage>
<p>Peace!—no peace is with me. Lazarra's heart harbours eternal hatred; and, come this night, Albert shall rue my vengeance.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Exit.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<stage>(alone.)</stage>
<p>That man has mischief in his heart; and look! his lips have left a red and angry spot upon my hand.—May no such pilgrims ever visit here! —Hah! my dear lord!</p>
</sp>
<stage>(ALBERT <hi>enters.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>What do I see? JOANNA, and abroad? Are you not out too early?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Are you not rather home too soon, my Albert,
<pb n="7" facs="23"/>
if your field sports might dissipate that gloom which for these three days past, hath hung upon you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Alas! the field affords no sport for me: I shall not hunt to-day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Then, for the first time, I demand my right; my part in your affliction. Do not tell me that I am weak, a woman—and unfit to be the sharer of your secret thoughts: Am I not Albert's wife; and did the vow he pledg'd me at the altar only make me the fond associate of his happy hours, not of his sad ones? Oh, my best of friends! thou hast nurs'd me in sickness; may not I cheer thee in sorrow?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Excellent Joanna! be satisfied; I will not keep a worm to gnaw my conscience; nor hold that back which is another's right.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>What is another's right?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Ev'n all you see.—This castle, at whose gate you feed the poor; this rich domain, was ravish'd from its owner, the banish'd Lord of Thurn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Not by my Albert.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>No.—Would to heaven my father had been clear from that reproach as I am! But alas! it was a guilty business, my Joanna; and tho' in candour I'm not bound to blazon my father's shame, in honour I am bound to render justice to the Lord of Thurn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="24"/>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>The Lord of Thurn is dead.—He had no son.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>He had a daughter; and, if she survives, she is the rightful heiress.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Well, where is she?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>That is not known. Her father was attack'd and slain by robbers. This daughter, then an infant, was with him; and whether she was carried off alive, or shar'd her father's fate, remains in doubt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Then do we hold this castle but in trust till that doubt is resolv'd. Let her be found.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>And is Joanna then content to lose what she employs so worthily?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>To lose?—How is that lost which we've no right to keep?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>True; but reflect, that when this castle's gone, my family estate is all that's left me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Is that all?—No; you have a faithful wife, a lovely hopeful child, a mind at peace, and the pure bliss which unstain'd honour gives—enjoyments, Albert, which who hath, is rich in his proud poverty; and who hath not, is beggar'd by his riches.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Glorious woman, come to my arms! This treasure is my own: Nothing but death can rob me of this wealth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="25"/>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>We will have treasure where death cannot reach it. When conscious rectitude hath chac'd the cloud that wrinkles on your brow, and with a smile you enter the small cot where I will meet you, cherubs of health and peace shall deck the chamber of our repose with furniture more rich than kings can purchase; the low roof shall mount above the pitch of palaces and towers; and when I walk beside thee, what imports it if leagues or inches limit our possessions? Thou art my property, thy love my treasure, thy courage my strong castle and defence: One robe adorns me, thy untainted honour; one costly jewel, my beloved child.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(PHILIP <hi>enters.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>If I intrude, forgive me. I was told you had ask'd for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>'Tis true, I did, good Philip; this day completes the year that I have held you a hostage for the allegiance of your father, my castellan of Belmont. Now go in peace, and greet him in my name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>You have forgiv'n him wholly, noble sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>'Tis not my practice to forgive by halves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>You've buried in oblivion his offence.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>What I forgive I also can forget.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>So cannot I your most unbounded goodness.
<pb n="10" facs="26"/>
For life alone I am my father's debtor; for virtue, your's. You taught me how to prize it, and your example train'd me in the practice. My father's failings you have never mention'd in presence of his son. For this I thank you—'twas delicate, 'twas noble! But I can no more.— When feelings are so strong expression fails.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Farewell, good Philip! Let us often see you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you are so great, so rich!—</p>

<p>What's rich and great, that fortune can reverse? Let us be in your thoughts, as you in our's.</p>

<p>Worthy Philip! his heart is full; he never will forget us: and in the day of trouble, of whose coming I have an awful warning, I predict that grateful youth will be a friend to serve us. Hah! who comes here, with our old Warden, Wolf.</p>

face; I only say he wears Lazarra's livery; and therefore, catching him in the coat of a scoundrel, I humbly apprehend he cannot fail to be of the complexion of a rascal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>That's but an outside argument, friend Wolf.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WOLF.</speaker>
<p>Sir, take which side you will of a convicted thief, and you shall find him still an arrant knave; for here's the case—this fellow lurks about, and hides in the thick woods; why does he so? Why but because the gallows stands in sight, and 'tis a pretty eye-trap he has no taste for, being a two-leg'd building without floors, the which who takes possession of is left to dangle and cut capers in the air.—I pray you, Sir, give him a lease for life of that same airy tenement; that sky-parlour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>How long has it been my custom to condemn a man unheard? Let him speak for himself. Are you in the service of Lazarra?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>WOLF.</speaker>
<p>Old Guntram is an old fox, and if you are the child of his sister—(saving her ladyship's presence)—I take leave to tell you, you are the son of a strumpet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>For shame! must your abuse sweep all his kindred?—What has Guntram done to deserve this of you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WOLF.</speaker>
<p>Guntram's a cheat, an old litigious knave; he robb'd your father, and he cribs from you rood after rood, and in the dead of night alters the landmarks.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Come, no more of this!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WOLF.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir, I have not half run out his roll. Guntram's a traitor, harbours rogues and runagates, javelin companions in Lazarra's pay, who carry within their shields wicked designs against your castle's peace.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Lazarra is a knight; there's peace between us. I will not hold his servant—Set him free!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WOLF.</speaker>
<p>Well! if it must be so—untie him! There, get out! Give him the rope, however, for a keepsake; he'll find an use for it ere long—Now, go your way—be sure you rob and pillage all you come near; you are turn'd out for that purpose and none other. Out! begone!</p>
<stage><hi>(Exit</hi> ROMUALD, <hi>guarded.</hi>)</stage>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>And now of me—a light and easy task for you perhaps, but agony to me.</p>

<p>I must confess his manners do not please me. I would to Heaven my Eloisa were the humblest herdsman's daughter rather than Guntram's! Can it be in nature that soul like thine so tender, heart so pure, and manners so refin'd and elegant should spring from such a stock? Is he not shun'd by all the neighbours round, a petty tyrant, the oppressor of the poor?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>ELOISA.</speaker>
<p>This may be true, but I ought not to hear it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Rich to excess, and grasping after more, he would sell any thing, ev'n thee, for gold. Forgive me, my sweet love, I have said too much— but when I know he harbours in his heart a base design to sacrifice thy charms to the first pander that will pay his price, I can no longer meet him as thy father, but must abhor and fly him as a pest.</p>

<p>A plague upon this bridge for lying here at his full length over the sleepy moat! To my thoughts now it seems to cry—"Come, cross me!"

As times now go, let there be ever betwixt me and danger a good broad ditch, say I; but my wise master seems to forget that thirteen centuries are past and gone, since peace and charity were preach'd on earth. Oh Lord, oh Lord! how does it come to pass that honest men should be such easy gulls to live with scoundrels and keep open house! I'll coast about and listen.—Hark! what's that? 'Tis not a trumpet; no, nor yet a drum; but tis the clank of men that march in armour—Yes, yes, 'tis that— Click, click! just so my rapier jingles, when dangling in the slings it hits my cuirass.—Hoa! within there!

<p>About it quickly then. There is no time to lose.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="42"/>
<speaker>LAZARRA.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, I know you: trifle not with me. I know you are not Albert's wife in heart: 'tis but a compromise you make with duty; these are but fetters, which your parents forg'd—and thus I set you free.</p>
<stage>(approaches her.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Avaunt, blasphemer! This dagger sets me free, if you approach. Have you forgot from whom I am descended? Dishonour cannot taint a Montfaucon. The wife of Albert does not fear to die.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAZARRA.</speaker>
<p>The lover of Joanna does not wish it. I come at peril of my life to break those chains, whose burden hangs so heavy on you; that death is less unwelcome than their weight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>'Tis false. My husband is my crown of glory; thron'd in his bosom I defy your threats. Shame on your knighthood! recreant as you are, twice foil'd, twice vanquish'd in the lists by Albert; how like a coward do you now attack him, under the mask of a perfidious truce, for which his honest nature gave you credit; and free to face you as an open foe, made no defence against a secret robber.</p>

<p>Temper your anger, lest you call forth mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Your anger cannot move even a woman; and is of all the passions that belong to you, your love excepted, what I most despise.</p>

<sp>

<speaker>LAZARRA.</speaker>
<p>Insulting woman, you'll extort a secret which else in pity I had kept untold.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>In pity!—Tiger, who expects it from you? I saw my gallant husband force the bridge. I have no pity to implore for him; and for myself, whilst I command this weapon, I scorn to ask it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAZARRA.</speaker>
<p>You saw your husband force the bridge—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>I did.—I saw your lancemen fall beneath his sword.</p>

<p>And was that all you saw?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>What else was to be seen?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>LAZARRA.</speaker>
<p>Did Albert slay my people, and receive no wounds from them? Is he invulnerable?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Tormenter! Will you tell me he was wounded?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAZARRA.</speaker>
<p>I should suppose so, when he fell.</p>

<p>You've miss'd it.—Ha! she faints!
<stage><hi>(JOANNA</hi> sinks to the ground, and drops her dagger.)</stage>
I've gone too far: She loves him 'tis too plain. What shall I do? I dare not stir to help her; my very touch would kill her: lost, absorb'd, and all her senses gone, still, still she awes me.— 'Tis said, that in the spot where saints are buried, some angel still keeps guard upon their bones; and if the man of blood approach, he dies: I am a man of blood; and tho' the wreck of beauty lies before me, prostrate, defenceless, I've no heart to harm her.—I'll hence, and call for help.

<p>Where am I? Hah! Lazarra has escap'd me, and left me here, defenceless and unarm'd, robb'd of my last, my only sure resource!
<stage>(she rises.)</stage>
Oh Albert! Oh my husband! I had treasur'd your parting words:—
"My wife knows how to die; when all is lost, that can protect her honour"
— All now is lost, for thou art gone for ever.—Ha! here are weapons.—Spirits of the just! guardians of virtue, aid me!
<stage>(attempts to pull down a sword from a pile of armour.)</stage>
Cruel sword! thou wilt not succour the sad wretch that needs thee: Thou art no hero's weapon; else my hand, weak tho' it is, had brought thee down to save me. One effort more.—Now, now, despair, assist me!
<stage>(she dislodges a cluster, by which a sword and several lances fall.)</stage>
— 'Tis done! 'tis done!
<pb n="29" facs="45"/>
the angel of my rescue has nerv'd my arm to pull this trophy down, and offers to my view a choice of deaths.
<stage>(takes up a sword.)</stage>
And here I chuse. Come forth, thou trenchant blade! blush not to prove thyself the friend of virtue, tho' in a woman's grasp. Terrific weapon! whatever master own'd thee, I can warrant thou hast be-widow'd many a wretched wife; now vindicate the honour of a widow, and send her hence, to be a wife in Heaven.

<p>You kept my son in pledge a twelvemonth for it.</p>

<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>If mine it is, let Belmont give protection to it's owner; for tho' you ask me why so far from Thurn, I must believe you know that Thurn is lost, my wife a prisoner, my son a slave, myself a fugitive, the earth my bed, Heaven's canopy my roof. This if you knew, why have you not assembled your retainers to rescue those dear pledges from their danger? But if you knew it not, I tell you now, Lazarra is the villain who has robb'd me.</p>

<p>You was pleas'd to say but now, I had fail'd you once: I neither fail'd you once, nor ever will. I then was, what consistently I still am, and ever will be, your determin'd foe.</p>

<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Wensel, remember I forgave you.</p>

<p>Yes; your vanity forgave me, but your pride shew'd to the world that you had power to punish; and that my spirit never will forgive. You made my son your hostage, haughty Lord; now you are mine—arrest him!</p>

If I cou'd jump now on a snug warm cottage, a mess of milk and a clean truss of straw, 't would be a blessed chance; but no, no, no: These mountaineers would break my neck to catch 'em, and when I've caught 'em, they'll not break my fast.—There's Wensel's watch tower! The devil watch him. I have too much respect for this old carcase, tho' bruis'd and batter'd by Lazarra's cut-throats, to trust it in his keeping, ugly thief! —If my poor master falls into his hands, he might

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>Who and what are you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WOLF.</speaker>
<p>Not a swallow, friend, to feed on flies; nor a cameleon to live on air; but a poor hungry man, infinite weary, and tolerably honest—therefore do you see, if your pot boils and you're in haste for supper, sooner than let it cool, I'll make one with you.</p>

your fare! I now perceive, grave Sir, you are the Hermit so famous in these parts for your piety and learning: I will not trouble you on these points at present, being just now in greater need of food and rest than hymns and homilies.</p>

<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>First tell me, are you not of Wensel's company?</p>

<p>Indeed I am not: 'Tis the last company I would wish to be in.</p>

<p>Do you belong to Guntram or Lazarra?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WOLF.</speaker>
<p>If I belong'd to either you shou'd hang me. I belong to Albert, Lord of Thurn—Wolf at your service—so I am call'd by name; I am not such by nature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>Your name I have often heard; and ever grac'd with commendations of your character: Your master I am a stranger to.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WOLF.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! Where have you liv'd? His charities are pretty well known.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>I have heard of them; they are gone to Heaven before him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WOLF.</speaker>
<p>Truly I fear he'll shortly follow them, for when we parted he was on his way, and had but barely got the start of death: As for my part, I was thrown out of the race, being down in battle,
<pb n="35" facs="51"/>
with half a score of rapiers at my throat, expecting every moment my quietus; but this, good father, is a soldier's story, and only should be told over a can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>Come on then, you shall have the can, my friend, and I the story; for I love a soldier. I dwell no further off than in that rock, and have employ'd no architect but nature—So we poor hermits are content to live.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WOLF.</speaker>
<p>I know what sort of tenements your's are, and how you live scot-free, under the wind, and pay no rent except to Providence, on whose account you garnish out your lodgings with mementoes, that mark the tenure under which you hold: But all your skulls and bones won't break my rest; Death is to me no stranger; I've seen him in all shapes; in all his terrors; and know his face too well to fear his picture.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>ELOISA.</speaker>
<p>He gave to those that hunger'd: he himself hungers in chains. Alas! I pity him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>Yes, human sufferings strike our hearts with pity; and oft we wonder at the ways of Providence, that thus permits good men to be oppress'd; but whilst we only reason from effects, Heaven acts from causes unreveal'd to us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELOISA.</speaker>
<p>Ah, father! these are things above my reach: I have not understanding of these matters; but believe it all because you say it. You may have known variety of fortune; I've no experience of that sort: my life has been a scene of uniform depression. I've often ask'd the history of your days, but you've no confidence in me to tell it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>'T will give you pain; why should you wish to hear it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELOISA.</speaker>
<p>The tender pain that pity gives, is pleasing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>I have seen better days, been rich and noble; and all the soft affinities, so dear to human nature, I have fondly cherish'd! Heaven's mercy gave them; cruel man destroy'd them!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELOISA.</speaker>
<p>Ah, poor unfortunate! you've been a father—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="41" facs="57"/>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>I have; and when you call me by that name, the recollection that I had a daughter, who might have been the blessing of my age; this, this, my child, pulls at my heart-strings!—and when I wou'd speak, at thy desire, I cannot— I am stifled!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELOISA.</speaker>
<p>Then I will never ask it more.—And now behold my father, and that odious Darbony.—Retire into that grotto, good old man! and take your basket with you: harbour there till they are gone.—I would not have them see you.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(HERMIT <hi>retires.</hi>)</stage>
<stage>(GUNTRAM <hi>and</hi> DARBONY <hi>enter.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNTRAM.</speaker>
<p>There, there she is! Now you shall hear me speak as softly to her as the zephyr blows: Child, this is Darbony, a wealthy knight; a gentleman of Florence: one whose sword has carv'd him out a fortune by the wars, that well may warrant him to say, to any the best and proudest spinster in the land—"Come Yorth, and be my bride!"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELOISA.</speaker>
<p>Well, let him say it to any; so it is not to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNTRAM.</speaker>
<p>How now! do you rebel? Do you murmur, saucy chit? I've said the word; the bond is sign'd and seal'd: you marry him this night. You see I am calm; you see I take a gentle course of persuasion with you: but have a care how you chafe me; take heed how you anger
<pb n="42" facs="58"/>
me! By all that's terrible, if you hold off, I'll have you dragg'd to the altar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DARBONY.</speaker>
<p>Softly, friend Guntram! there you go too fast. You are old and harsh; your daughter's young and gentle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNTRAM.</speaker>
<p>Aye, tell her so! You are a notable lover; and she 'll tell you she is too young to marry you. She'd not say that to me, if I propos'd Philip of Belmont, neighbour Wensel's son: not she, not she; she'd jump into his arms.—But she shall know these shuffling pleas won't pass: she's your's this very night.—Hav'nt I said the word?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DARBONY.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you have <hi>said</hi> the word; but when the theme is love, we hold it as the better way to <hi>sing</hi> it:</p>
<lg>
<l>"In spring's sweet prime the op'ning flow'r</l>
<l>"Allures the roving bee;</l>
<l>"And is not beauty's vernal hour</l>
<l>"The hour for love and thee?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"For, like the bee, love's archer leaves</l>
<l>"His honey with the dart;</l>
<l>"And she, who feels the wound, receives</l>
<l>"A sweet, that heals the smart."</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNTRAM.</speaker>
<p>There, there, you lucky girl! you've got a husband, whose very voice is harmony itself.</p>

<p>Oh! if, unseen, my guardian Genius hears,

<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>To beg indeed—to implore, for pity's sake—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNTRAM.</speaker>
<p>Well; come to-morrow; there 'll be scraps in plenty to fill your wallet, if you come tomorrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>'Tis not for scraps; tis mercy, and not meat, for which I hunger.—Oh, for Heaven's sweet sake, recal the cruel sentence you have pass'd, and do not force this marriage on your daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Why do you fly the company?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>The company, my father!—the assassins.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WENSEL.</speaker>
<p>Insolent boy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Will you betray your friend, and after murder him? Oh conscience, conscience! speak to the heart of this unhappy man in the still voice of pity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WENSEL.</speaker>
<p>Canting pedant, chill not the noble ardour of my soul, when the wine revels in my kindling veins, and my heart bounds with joy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Wine may confound and suffocate the feelings for a while; but when the mad delusive dream is past, and reason shows you where such dreams must end, then will your cry be turn'd aside from Heaven, and like the unhallow'd sacrifice of Cain, prophetic of your doom, sink down abhorr'd, rejected, and accurst.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>WENSEL.</speaker>
<p>No more of this! be dumb!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Forbid me not. Silence will come too soon: Old age hangs over you, and the dark hour of death approaches—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>WENSEL.</speaker>
<p>If death is near, beware how you provoke it. Hence, be gone!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>WENSEL.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my anger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Why do you bear this enmity to Albert? Why, but because he spar'd you, he forgave you, sent back your son, and trusted to your honour?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WENSEL.</speaker>
<p>The more fool he, who first forgives a foe, and after trusts him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Ah, if such are fools, woe to your wisdom!</p>

<p>My father! No, if you embrue your hands in Albert's blood, I will not call you father; I will not meet the curse that is entail'd upon the son of such an impious father.</p>

<p>What do you mean by this contemptuous silence? The axe is sharpen'd, and the hand is ready, that severs your proud head this very night.</p>

<p>No, Philip; if Joanna yet survives, live for her sake; live for my infant son. Tell my sad widow that I left this world convinc'd of her fidelity, and died beseeching Heaven to bless her, pouring out with my last breath my thanks for all the hours of my past happiness by her bestow'd—Tell her, the hope she cherish'd in her sickness, supported me in the last pangs of death— the pious hope that in a better world the renovation of our faithful love, made pure and perfect, will compose a part of that beatitude, which heart of man cannot conceive, and only Heaven can give.—My last farewel, and blessing to my son!—He is too young to know—but time may

<p>Keep fast the prisoner! I command you hold him, as you shall answer it to our Lord Lazarra.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Fear not a rescue; we've no arms to force you; nor have you hearts that can be touch'd by pity. My fears were for my friend, lest in the tyrant he forgot a father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<p>We are not careful what becomes of Wensel; we are Lazarra's servants; and for Philip, let him look to himself; we think not of him.</p>

<p>You talk and act exactly as they shou'd, who serve a master brutal as Lazarra.</p>

<p>No, in the eastern tower, where the chain of rocks begins.</p>

<p>You're right, you're right; 'tis from the eastern tower the chain of rocks begins.—And how long is it to his execution?</p>

<p>From this to midnight.</p>

<p>Now, Albert, I am arm'd for thy deliverance.

Hah! who art thou?</p>
<stage>(the Hermit enters as Philip was going out.)</stage>
<p>What do you want, old man! no one comes here: go, go, begone! my father is asleep.</p>

<p>I do not want your father: If you are Philip, my business is with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>I am Philip, but I can't hear your business— you must defer your business till to-morrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>Impossible. To-morrow it wou'd be too late.</p>

<p>What then; what then? Life hangs upon my haste.</p>

<p>So does it upon mine; an innocent life, a life more dear to Philip than his own—Your Eloisa—</p>

<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Heaven preserve my senses!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>Is lost to you for ever—sold, surrendered, and sacrific'd this night by her unnatural father—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>How! to whom?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>To Darbony.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>The monster! will he devote his daughter to that daemon—that Moloch bath'd in blood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>Too sure he will. The father and the fiend will drag their beauteous victim to the altar ere midnight bell is toll'd.—Poor Eloisa rests her last hope on thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>On me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>On thee she calls—to thee she turns for help —she summons thee to save her; 'tis from her, a weak but willing messenger, I come.—In her

despair she cried, "Go tell my Philip, without his instant rescue I am lost."</p>
<stage>(<hi>PHILIP</hi> takes the keys from his breast, looks at them, wrings his hands in despair, and returns them to their place.)</stage>
<p>What does that action mean? Why do you tarry? Are you not Philip, or am I mistrusted?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>You are not mistrusted, and I—I am Philip.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>Then follow me at once; it is high time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Yes, 'tis high time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>And we have far to go.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Oh! choice of horrors! Turn my heart, just Heaven, where honour, truth, and virtue shou'd direct it! load not thy feeble creature past his bearing, but by my weakness measure thy temptation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>What is the matter? Whence is your distress?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Thou art the messenger of Eloisa, therefore I tell thee, that within this castle the noble Albert languishes in chains. He is my benefactor, my instructor, my first, my best of friends, my more
<pb n="53" facs="69"/>
than father. Here in my hand is liberty for Albert; a secret passage, which these keys command, leads him to safety—if I lose one hour, 'twill be too late; at midnight he must die; in the same moment, when the cruel father of Eloisa sacrifices her, my father murders him. Can I desert him? No, no, I cannot. Let me do this deed to make me worthy Eloisa's love, then I will set her free, or die in the attempt. Go, go; I cannot follow thee; depart! Heaven at this trying crisis will send forth its angel to protect her—I cannot; love wou'd make me a murderer if I did.</p>

<p>He may call long enough before I'll come.</p>

<speaker>GUNTRAM.</speaker>
<p>Who says I spurn at money? I love money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>Jewels are money's-worth, and these Lord Albert has brought off in plenty: they're very rich, and knowing you a safe and prudent man, he wishes to entrust them to your keeping.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUNTRAM.</speaker>
<p>Aye! who believes you? let me see the jewels.</p>

<p>By'r lady, a rich gem, a peerless ruby; but this I never saw upon his finger.</p>

<p>You know the bearings of the house of Thurn. What did Lord Albert wear upon his banner?</p>

<p>A crowned lion.</p>

<p>Yes, but I am no eagle to fly to it.</p>
</sp>

<p>Then send a nimbler messenger—your daughter—Whom can you trust so well?</p>

<p>You're craz'd, methinks—My daughter is upon the point of marriage.</p>

<p>That's true, that's true. Why did'nt you bring 'em with you?</p>

<p>It is only one. Let there be dug a grave where Albert fell, and in the spot, made sacred by his blood, let me be buried.</p>

<p>No, you may not. Because you tauntingly pronounce my sight so hateful, that the blast of death wou'd be more welcome, I'll henceforth provide, that if you ever let the light of Heaven visit your eyes, you shall behold Lazarra. I'll have a score of painters set to work, and hang my portrait up in every chamber through which you pass, 'till the detested image of him whose presence taints the genial air shall be so everlastingly impress'd on your mind's eye, in darkness you shall see it; in solitude, in sleep, I still will haunt you, nor shall the grave itself conceal me from you.—Now follow me, proud dame! Do you rebel?—Move, or my guards shall drag you—Hah! 'tis well! I will not quit you.

He has no business here: What does he come for? I'll tell you what—for plunder—to drive you out of your cabins, as he has drove the worthy Lord of Thurn out of his castle—Will you suffer it?</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Thanks, gallant youth! a faintness steals upon me; I must confess to you I need repose.—Ah, Philip, to be torn from those we love dearer than life, and in the hour of danger, by strong necessity driven to desert them, judge how it wrings my heart!</p>

<p>I do—I judge, I feel it by my own.—No more, but enter.

<p>I'll not permit thee to despond, my child. There is a Providence, that bear me up above my body's strength in thy protection.

</sp>
<stage>(<hi>ALBERT</hi> comes from the cell.)</stage>

<p>Be not thus cast in wonder. I am Albert, not dying, as she thinks, but sav'd from death, if you betray me not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELOISA.</speaker>
<p>If we betray you! we are not those that wou'd betray the wretch that fled from justice to invoke protection; how then shou'd we betray the good Lord Albert, the patron of the needy and opprest, the orphan's father and the widow's friend? Blest be the hand that rescued thee from death! Say who it was, that I may pray for him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Philip of Belmont.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELOISA.</speaker>
<p>Oh approving Heaven, crown him, reward him for the glorious deed. My Philip has preserv'd you; I acquit him. I was in like extremity with you at the same hour; I call'd him to my rescue in vain; his virtue triumph'd o'er his love. He turn'd from me and sav'd his benefactor. I praise him, I applaud him for the choice: you had a husband's and a father's claim; for you the hearts of thousands wou'd have bled; for me none other than his own.</p>

<p>Ah, father, if you knew the Lord of Thurn.</p>

<p>I hope he has been taught to know himself in his adversity.—I knew his father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>I'm sorry for it, if you knew him rightly; for then you know what cause I have to blush, when I am falsely stil'd the Lord of Thurn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>That to confess bespeaks a candid mind; for that I honour you; but Thurn is lost. What then remains?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Before to-morrow's dawn either to see Lazarra at my feet, or see the light no more: if on the walls my banner flies, it flies not for myself, but for the daughter of that rightful Lord, who in his banishment was basely murder'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>Alas, that daughter never will be found, nor was that father murder'd; he yet lives, and I am he. Yes, Albert, I, I am that wretched father; degraded, exil'd, and at once bereft of wife, son, daughter; outcast of the world; no home, no country, not one friend on earth, save this sweet innocent, the feeble staff of an old beggar tottering to his grave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Oh heavenly justice, how did I escape, whilst you was begging at that castle's gate, which I, unconscious of your right, usurp'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="67" facs="83"/>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>That I am Theodore, the banisht Lord of Thurn and its domain, I had in proof to shew one relick, which the robbers miss'd, my crest (a crowned lion) cut in ruby; but this last pledge I left in Guntram's hands for purposes, which this dear child can witness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>There needs no witness to the truth you utter; and here, in presence of high Heaven, I swear to pay you homage, and restore your right.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>No, no, your virtues have aton'd to justice; you, Albert, have the blessings of the poor: Had I possession, what cou'd I have more? I have no daughter; the inhuman villains, that robb'd and left me dying, kill'd my child. Within that cell I have preserv'd one relick, one mournful relick. —You shall see my store.</p>

<p>This, this is all that's left me of my daughter;

<p>Unhappy father, what can I do for thee?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>Nothing for me: childless and old, forgetting this vain world, and by the world forgotten, for myself I only ask a grave—but for this innocent whom I have snatcht from misery, and who clings, as if by nature's charter, to my heart—for her I make appeal to your protection, and as in honour you shall deal with her, so may Heaven deal forgiveness to your father.</p>
</sp>

<p>Shall we have the lives within it? Shall I greet my wife? Shall I embrace my son?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>Dismiss these terrors, and repose your hope where you have lodged your faith. Draw forth your sword! We cannot fail to conquer when those we combat are the foes of Heaven!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>'Tis done. Now, heroes, follow to the charge!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>A moment's patience. Where shall we bestow this aged father, and his defenceless daughter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Wolf, you are wounded; you shall stay behind: there lives not one more worthy of that trust.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WOLF.</speaker>
<p>There lives not one less likely to perform it; for though I have a reverence for old age, and a soft side towards innocence and beauty, yet if I hear the clash of swords in battle, I must, perforce, turn out and make one with them: therefore let me be foremost in the onset, and last in the retreat—there is my post.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIT.</speaker>
<p>I will not hold one hero from his duty; and,
<pb n="75" facs="91"/>
though I can no longer wield a sword, behold I have a weapon—
<stage>(shows a dagger)</stage>.
This, and the darkness of the night, will guard us, therefore, go forth, and conquer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELOISA.</speaker>
<p>There is an arbour (Philip knows the spot) of nature's making, in the chesnut grove, beside the western tower; there we may pass the anxious minutes, and put up our prayers for your success.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Escort them to the place! We, the mean while, will martial our brave band, and for our wives, our children, and our altars, assur'd of conquest, we rush upon the foe!</p>

<p>The monster will not let me see my child— Well! Heaven's high will be done—There was a time when my afflicted spirit was prepar'd to die with Albert! But last night in silence I commun'd with my heart, and heard a voice that seem'd to cry within me—
"Hold thine hand, creature of God! thy life is not thine own, and none but he that gave can take away"— I started; left my couch; my lamp was burning; the book of life was open on my table; I read; the text was—patience—and the word of inspiration sunk into my heart with influence so persuasive, so serene, that as I read, I reasoned, and perceived when Heaven is pleased to punish,

<stage>(EUGENE <hi>enters to</hi> JOANNA.)</stage>
<p>Is there not something stirring in the castle that occupies my tyrant, and reprieves me from his detested presence?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENE.</speaker>
<p>I think there is—Scouts are for ever passing, that scour the country round; the walls are manned; in all the watch towers centinels are posted, and by what is going forward, I should suppose he looks to be attack'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Alas! what can my helpless people do, when their brave leader's lost, and Wolf is killed, and Philip is far off?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENE.</speaker>
<p>Of Philip I know nothing; but for Wolf, I must believe he lives, and that I saw him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>Boy, you're deceived; let me not hear of hope, save what the cheering recollection gives, that all the sufferings of this transient life must have a speedy end: of this assur'd, I am prepar'd, for conscience sake, to brave all that Lazarra's fury can inflict to shake my honour, or subdue my spirit; for 'tis no question with me whom to fear—him, a contemptible and short-liv'd tyrant, that only can afflict me for awhile, or that tremendous judge whose just award is happiness or misery without end.</p>

Will sighs and tears relieve her sad despair? Oh they wou'd! I'd weep my eyes to water.</p>

<p>Albert, ere this, is dead! Where is Joanna?

<p>We had no hands to spare from other duty.</p>

<p>No, they were all employ'd upon your trenchers; you are greedy feeders all, but lazy workers. Why did you not set the prisoners upon it?</p>

<p>Twice conquer'd, you have forfeited your title to the fair treatment of a loyal knight, for you have broke the truce you swore to, and, like a robber in the dead of night, forc'd my unguarded castle; conquer'd now, and all retreat cut off, you're at my mercy—Deliver up your sword, and ask your life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAZARRA.</speaker>
<p>To me these terms! You little know Lazarra. I forc'd your castle—true; for in your castle there dwelt a lady, whom you dar'd to marry in violation of the laws of honour.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>ALBERT.</speaker>
<p>Honour! You ought not to pronounce the name.</p>

<p>Albert, if every conqueror had a cause worthy as your's, we shou'd rejoice in conquests; but in this world, for reasons only known to Heaven, bad men will triumph for a time, and be the lords and arbiters of fortune. You are both good and prosperous, and your candour in owning me the rightful Lord of Thurn, cancels your father's wrongs; but what you risqu'd your life to gain for life you shall possess. Give Philip Belmont, and I'll give him her, that wou'd convert a cottage to a palace—Take her, brave youth, she's your's!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>With heart and soul grateful to Heaven and you, I seal my thanks upon this beauteous hand, and greet my blessing.</p>

<speaker>JOANNA.</speaker>
<p>May years of happiness attend you both!</p>
