<head>TO The Rev<span rend="sup">d</span> Mr HURD.</head>
<lg type="elegy">
<head>ELEGY.</head>
<l>FRIEND of my youth, who, when the willing Muse</l>
<l>Stream'd o'er my breast her warm poetic rays,</l>
<l>Saw'st the fresh seeds their vital powers diffuse,</l>
<l>And fed'st them with the fost'ring dew of praise!</l>
<l>Whate'er the produce of th' unthrifty soil,</l>
<l>The leaves, the flowers, the fruits, to thee belong:</l>
<l>The labourer earns the wages of his toil;</l>
<l>Who form'd the Poet, well may claim the song.</l>
<l>Yes, 'tis my pride to own, that taught by thee</l>
<l>My conscious soul superior flights essay'd;</l>
<l>Learnt from thy lore the Poet's dignity,</l>
<l>And spurn'd the hirelings of the rhyming trade.</l>
<l>Say, scenes of Science, say, thou haunted stream!</l>
<l>[For oft my Muse-led steps did'st thou behold]</l>
<l>How on thy banks I rifled every theme,</l>
<l>That Fancy fabled in her age of gold.</l>
<l>How oft I cry'd, " O come, thou tragic Queen!</l>
<l>" March from thy Greece with firm majestic tread!</l>
<l>" Such as when Athens saw thee fill her scene,</l>
<l>" When Sophocles thy choral Graces led;</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="4"/>
" Saw thy proud pall it's purple length devolve,</l>
<l>" Saw thee uplift the glitt'ring dagger high,</l>
<l>" Ponder with fixed brow thy deep resolve</l>
<l>" Prepar'd to strike, to triumph, and to die.</l>
<l>" Bring then to Britain's plain that choral throng,</l>
<l>" Display thy buskin'd pomp, thy golden lyre,</l>
<l>" Give her historic forms the soul of song,</l>
<l>" And mingle Attic art with Shakespear's fire."</l>
<l>" Ah what, fond Boy, dost thou presume to claim?"</l>
<l>The Muse reply'd. " Mistaken suppliant, know,</l>
<l>" To light in Shakespear's breast the dazzling flame</l>
<l>" Exhausted all Parnassus could bestow.</l>
<l>" True; Art remains; and, if from his bright page</l>
<l>" Thy mimic power one vivid beam can seize,</l>
<l>" Proceed; and in that best of tasks engage,</l>
<l>" Which tends at once to profit, and to please."</l>
<l>She spake; and Harewood's Towers spontaneous rose;</l>
<l>Soft virgin warblings eccho'd thro' the grove;</l>
<l>And fair Elfrida pour'd forth all her woes,</l>
<l>The hapless pattern of connubial Love.</l>
<l>More awful scenes old Mona next display'd;</l>
<l>Her caverns gloom'd, her forests wav'd on high,</l>
<l>While flam'd within their consecrated shade</l>
<l>The Genius stern of British liberty.</l>
<l>And see, my HURD! to thee those scenes consign'd;</l>
<l>O! take and stamp them with thy honour'd name.</l>

<l>And, if they find the road to honest Fame,</l>

<stage>AULUS DIDIUS, with Romans.</stage>
<sp>
<l>THIS is the secret centre of the isle:</l>
<l>Here, Romans, pause, and let the eye of wonder</l>
<l>Gaze on the solemn scene; behold yon oak,</l>
<l>How stern he frowns, and with his broad brown arms</l>
<l>Chills the pale plain beneath him: mark yon altar,</l>
<l>The dark stream brawling round it's rugged base,</l>
<l>These cliffs, these yawning caverns, this wide circus,</l>
<l>Skirted with unhewn stone: they awe my soul,</l>
<l>As if the very Genius of the place</l>
<l>Himself appear'd, and with terrific tread</l>
<l>Stalk'd thro' his drear domain. And yet, my friends,</l>
<l>(If shapes like his be but the fancy's coinage)</l>
<l>Surely there is a hidden power, that reigns</l>
<l>'Mid the lone majesty of untam'd nature,</l>
<l>Controuling sober reason; tell me else,</l>
<l>Why do these haunts of barb'rous superstition</l>
<l>O'ercome me thus? I scorn them, yet they awe me.</l>
<l>Call forth the British Princes: in this gloom</l>
<l>I mean to school them to our enterprize.</l>
<stage>Enter Vellinus and Elidurus.</stage>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="2" facs="8"/>AULUS DIDIUS, VELLINUS, ELIDURUS.</stage>
<sp>
<l>Ye pledges dear of Cartismandua's faith,</l>
<l>Approach! and to my uninstructed ear</l>
<l>Explain this scene of horror.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>Daring Roman,</l>
<l>Thy footsteps press on consecrated ground:</l>
<l>These mighty piles of magic-planted rock,</l>
<l>Thus rang'd in mystic order, mark the place</l>
<l>Where but at times of holiest festival</l>
<l>The Druid leads his train.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AULUS DIDIUS.</speaker>
<l>Where dwells the seer?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELLINUS.</speaker>
<l>In yonder shaggy cave; on which the moon</l>
<l>Now sheds a side-long gleam. His brotherhood</l>
<l>Possess the neighb'ring cliffs.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AULUS DIDIUS.</speaker>
<l>Yet up the hill</l>
<l>Mine eye descrys a distant range of caves,</l>
<l>Delv'd in the ridges of the craggy steep:</l>
<l>And this way still another.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>On the left</l>
<l>Refide the Sages skill'd in Nature's lore:</l>
<l>The changeful universe, it's numbers, powers,</l>
<l>Studious they measure, save when meditation</l>
<l>Gives place to holy rites: then in the grove</l>
<l>Each hath his rank and function. Yonder grots</l>
<l>Are tenanted by Bards, who nightly thence,</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="9"/>
Rob'd in their flowing vests of innocent white,</l>
<l>Descend, with harps that glitter to the moon,</l>
<l>Hymning immortal strains. The spirits of air,</l>
<l>Of earth, of water, nay of heav'n itself,</l>
<l>Do listen to their lay: and oft, 'tis said,</l>
<l>In visible shapes dance they a magic round</l>
<l>To the high minstrelsy. Now, if thine eye</l>
<l>Be sated with the view, haste to thy ships;</l>
<l>And ply thine oars; for, if the Druids learn</l>
<l>This bold intrusion, thou wilt find it hard</l>
<l>To foil their fury.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AULUS DIDIUS.</speaker>
<l>Prince, I did not moor</l>
<l>My light-arm'd shallops on this dangerous strand,</l>
<l>To sooth a fruitless curiosity:</l>
<l>I come in quest of proud Caractacus;</l>
<l>Who, when our veterans put his troops to flight,</l>
<l>Found refuge here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>If here the Monarch rests,</l>
<l>Presumptuous Chief! thou might'st as well essay</l>
<l>To pluck him from yon stars: Earth's ample range</l>
<l>Contains no surer refuge: underneath</l>
<l>The soil we tread, a hundred secret paths,</l>
<l>Scoopt thro' the living rock in winding maze,</l>
<l>Lead to as many caverns, dark, and deep:</l>
<l>'Mid which the hoary sages act their rites</l>
<l>Mysterious, rites of such strange potency,</l>
<l>As, done in open day, would dim the sun,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="10"/>
Tho' thron'd in noontide brightness. In such dens</l>
<l>He may for life lie hid.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AULUS DIDIUS.</speaker>
<l>We know the task</l>
<l>Most difficult: yet has thy royal mother</l>
<l>Furnish'd the means.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>My mother sayst thou, Roman?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AULUS DIDIUS.</speaker>
<l>In proof of that firm faith she lends to Rome,</l>
<l>She gave ye up her honour's hostages.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>She did: and we submit.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AULUS DIDIUS.</speaker>
<l>To Rome we bear ye;</l>
<l>From your dear country bear ye; from your joys,</l>
<l>Your loves, your friendships, all your souls hold precious.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>And dost thou taunt us, Roman, with our fate?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AULUS DIDIUS.</speaker>
<l>No, Youth, by heav'n, I would avert that fate.</l>
<l>Wish ye for liberty?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELLINUS, ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>More than for life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AULUS DIDIUS.</speaker>
<l>And would do much to gain it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELLINUS.</speaker>
<l>Name the task.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
<speaker>AULUS DIDIUS.</speaker>
<l>The task is easy. Haste ye to these Druids;</l>
<l>Tell them ye come, commission'd by your Queen,</l>
<l>To seek the great Caractacus; and call</l>
<l>His valour to her aid, against the Legions,</l>
<l>Which, led by our Ostorius, now assail</l>
<l>Her frontiers. The late treaty she has seal'd</l>
<l>Is yet unknown: and this her royal signet,</l>
<l>Which more to mask our purpose was obtain'd,</l>
<l>Shall be your pledge of faith. The eager king</l>
<l>Will gladly take the charge; and, he consenting,</l>
<l>What else remains, but to the Meinaï's shore</l>
<l>Ye lead his credulous step? there will we seize him:</l>
<l>Bear him to Rome, the substitute for you,</l>
<l>And give you back to freedom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELLINUS.</speaker>
<l>If the Druids.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AULUS DIDIUS.</speaker>
<l>If they, or he, prevent this artifice,</l>
<l>Then force must take it's way: then flaming brands,</l>
<l>And biting axes, weilded by our soldiers,</l>
<l>Must level these thick shades; and so unlodge</l>
<l>The lurking savage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>Gods, shall Mona perish?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AULUS DIDIUS.</speaker>
<l>Princes, her ev'ry trunk shall on the ground</l>
<l>Measure it's magnitude; unless ere dawn,</l>
<l>Ye lure this untam'd lion to our toils.</l>
<l>Go then, and prosper; I shall to the ships,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
<speaker>CARACTACUS.</speaker>
<l>And there expect his coming. Youths, remember,</l>
<l>He must to Rome to grace great Caesar's triumph:</l>
<l>Caesar and Fate demand him at your hands.</l>
<stage>Exit Aulus Didius, and Romans.</stage>
</sp>
<stage>ELIDURUS, VELLINUS.</stage>
<sp>
<l>And will heav'n suffer it? Will the just gods,</l>
<l>That tread yon spangled pavement o'er our heads,</l>
<l>Look from their sky and yield them? Will these Druids,</l>
<l>Their sage vicegerents, not call down the thunder;</l>
<l>And will not instant it's hot bolts be darted</l>
<l>In such a righteous cause? Yes, good old king,</l>
<l>Yes, last of Britons, thou art heav'ns own pledge;</l>
<l>And shalt be such 'till death.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELLINUS.</speaker>
<l>What means my brother,</l>
<l>Dost thou refuse the charge?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>Dost thou accept it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELLINUS.</speaker>
<l>It gives us liberty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>It makes us traytors.</l>
<l>Gods, would Vellinus do a deed of baseness?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELLINUS.</speaker>
<l>Will Elidurus scorn the profer'd boon</l>
<l>Of freedom?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>Yes, when such it's guilty price,</l>
<l>Brother, I spurn it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="13"/>
<speaker>VELLINUS.</speaker>
<l>Go then, foolish boy!</l>
<l>I'll do the deed myself.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>It shall not be:</l>
<l>I will proclaim the fraud.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELLINUS.</speaker>
<l>Wilt thou? 'tis well.</l>
<l>Hie to you cave; call loudly on the Druid;</l>
<l>And bid him drag to ignominious death</l>
<l>The partner of thy blood. Yet hope not thou</l>
<l>To 'scape; for thou didst join my impious steps:</l>
<l>Therefore his wrath shall curse thee: thou shalt live;</l>
<l>Yet shalt thou live an interdicted wretch,</l>
<l>All rights of nature cancell'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>O Vellinus!</l>
<l>Rend not my soul: by heav'n thou know'st I love thee,</l>
<l>As fervently as brother e'er lov'd brother:</l>
<l>And, loving thee, I thought I lov'd mine honour.</l>
<l>Ah! do not wake, dear youth, in this true breast</l>
<l>So fierce a conflict.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELLINUS.</speaker>
<l>Honour's voice commands</l>
<l>Thou shouldst obey thy mother, and thy queen.</l>
<l>Honour and sage religion both conspire</l>
<l>To bid thee save these consecrated groves</l>
<l>From Roman devastation.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>Horrid thought!</l>
<l>Hence let us haste, ev'n to the furthest nook</l>
<l>Of this wide isle; nor view the sacrilege.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELLINUS.</speaker>
<l>No, let us stay, and by our prosperous art</l>
<l>Prevent the sacrilege. Mark me, my brother,</l>
<l>More years, and more experience have matur'd</l>
<l>My sober thought; I will convince thy youth,</l>
<l>That this our deed has ev'ry honest sanction</l>
<l>Cool reason may demand.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>To Rome with reason:</l>
<l>Try if 'twill bring her deluging ambition</l>
<l>Into the level course of right and justice:</l>
<l>Try if 'twill tame these insolent invaders;</l>
<l>Who thus, in savageness of conquest, claim</l>
<l>Whom chance of war has spar'd. Do this, and prosper.</l>
<l>But, pray thee, do not reason from my soul</l>
<l>It's inbred honesty: that holy flame</l>
<l>How e'er eclips'd by Rome's black influence</l>
<l>In vulgar minds, ought still to glow in ours.</l>

<l>Vain talker leave me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIDURUS.</speaker>
<l>No, I will not leave thee:</l>
<l>I must not, dare not, in these perilous shades.</l>
<l>Think, if thy fraud should fail, these holy men,</l>
<l>How will their justice rend thy traitrous limbs?</l>
<l>If thou succeed'st, the fiercer pangs of conscience,</l>

<l>With wary circuit pace around the grove:</l>
<l>And guard each inlet; watchful, lest the eye</l>
<l>Of busy curiosity profane</l>
<l>Pry on our rites: which now must be as close</l>
<l>As done i'th' very central womb of earth.</l>
<l>Occasion claims it; for Caractacus</l>
<l>This night demands admission to our train.</l>
<l>He, once our king, while ought his power avail'd</l>
<l>To save his country from the rod of tyrants;</l>
<l>That duty past, does wisely now retire</l>
<l>To end his days in secrecy and peace;</l>
<l>Druid with Druids, in this chief of groves,</l>
<l>Ev'n in the heart of Mona. See, he comes!</l>
<l>How awful is his port! mark him, my friends!</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="22"/>
He looks, as doth the tower, whose nodding walls,</l>
<l>After the conflict of heav'n's angry bolts,</l>

<l>This holy place, methinks, doth this night wear</l>
<l>More than it's wonted gloom: Druid, these groves</l>
<l>Have caught the dismal colouring of my soul,</l>
<l>Changing their dark dun garbs to very sable,</l>
<l>In pity to their guest. Hail, hallow'd oaks!</l>
<l>Hail, British born! who, last of British race,</l>
<l>Hold your primaeval rights by nature's charter;</l>
<l>Not at the nod of Caesar. Happy foresters,</l>
<l>Ye wave your bold heads 'mid the liberal air;</l>
<l>Nor ask, for priviledge, a praetor's edict.</l>
<l>Ye, with your tough and intertwisted roots,</l>
<l>Grasp the firm rocks ye sprung from; and, erect</l>
<l>In knotty hardihood, still proudly spread</l>
<l>Your leafy banners 'gainst the tyrannous north,</l>

<l>But I am lost to that predestin'd use</l>
<l>Eternal wisdom will'd, and fitly therefore</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="23"/>
May wish a change of being. I was born</l>
<l>A king; and Heav'n, who bade these warrior oaks</l>
<l>Lift their green shields against the fiery sun,</l>
<l>To fence their subject plain, did mean, that I</l>
<l>Should, with as firm an arm, protect my people,</l>
<l>Against the pestilent glare of Rome's ambition.</l>
<l>I fail'd; and how I fail'd, thou know'st too well;</l>
<l>So does the babbling world: and therefore, Druid,</l>
<l>I would be any thing save what I am.</l>

<l>See, to thy wish, the holy rites prepar'd,</l>
<l>Which, if heav'n frown not, consecrate thee Druid:</l>
<l>See to the altar's base the victims led,</l>
<l>From whose free-gushing blood ourself shall read</l>
<l>Its high behests; which if assenting found,</l>
<l>These hands around thy chosen limbs shall wrap</l>
<l>The vest of sanctity; while at the act</l>
<l>Yon white-rob'd bards, sweeping their solemn harps,</l>
<l>Shall lift their choral warblings to the skies,</l>
<l>And call the gods to witness. Mean-while, Prince,</l>

<l>Must heave a sigh, for she is unreveng'd.</l>
<l>And can I taste true peace, she unreveng'd?</l>
<l>So chaste, so lov'd a queen? ah, Evilina!</l>

Hang not thus weeping on the feeble arm</l>
<l>That cou'd not save thy mother.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>EVILINA.</speaker>
<l>To hang thus</l>

<l>As doth the blessing of these pious seers,</l>
<l>When most they wish our welfare. Would to heav'n</l>

<l>'Tis wisely said. See, prince, this prudent maid,</l>

<l>Would save my queen</l>
<l>From a base ravisher; would wish to plunge</l>

<l>Ye are the sons of piety and peace;</l>
<l>Ye never felt the sharp vindictive spur,</l>
<l>That goads the injur'd warrior; the hot tide,</l>
<l>That flushes crimson on the conscious cheek</l>
<l>Of him, who burns for glory; else indeed</l>
<l>Ye much would pity me: would curse the fate</l>
<l>That coops me here inactive in your groves,</l>

<l>In nothing harsh, or cruel: and, howe'er</l>
<l>Misfortune works upon the minds of men,</l>
<l>(For some they say it turns to very stone)</l>
<l>Mine I am sure it softens. Wert thou guilty.</l>

Thy years have yet been prosp'rous. Did thy father</l>

<l>To yonder cave, and find thy brother safe:</l>
<l>He is not lost, as mine is. Youth, thou sigh'st</l>

<l><pb n="46" facs="56"/>
And why this silence? that some weighty grief</l>
<l>O'erhangs thy soul, thy ev'ry look proclaims.</l>
<l>Why then refuse it words? The heart, that bleeds</l>
<l>From any stroak of fate or human wrongs,</l>
<l>Loves to disclose itself, that list'ning pity</l>
<l>May drop a healing tear upon the wound.</l>
<l>'Tis only, when with inbred horror smote</l>
<l>At some base act, or done, or to be done,</l>
<l>That the recoiling soul, with conscious dread,</l>
<l>Shrinks back into itself. But thou, good youth—</l>

<l>Feel in these filial foldings! Speak not, boy,</l>
<l>Nor interrupt that heart-felt ecstacy</l>
<l>Should strike us mute. I know, what thou wouldst say,</l>
<l>Yet prithee, peace. Thy sister's voice hath clear'd thee,</l>
<l>And could excuse find words at this blest moment,</l>
<l>Trust me, I'd give it vent. But, 'tis enough,</l>
<l>Thy father welcomes thee to him and honour:</l>
<l>Honour, that now with rapt'rous certainty</l>
<l>Calls thee his own true offspring. Dost thou weep?</l>
<l>Ah, if thy tears swell not from joy's free spring,</l>
<l>I beg thee, spare them: I have done thee wrong,</l>
<l>Can make thee no atonement: None, alas!</l>
<l>Thy father scarce can bless thee, as he ought;</l>
<l>Unblest himself, beset with Foes around,</l>
<l>Bereft of queen, of kingdom, and of soldiers,</l>
<l>He can but give thee portion of his dangers,</l>

You are not slaves. Barbarians tho' you call us,</l>

<l>By Rome (what Britain sure should scorn to learn)</l>
<l>Her avarice, will we barter ye for gold.</l>
<l>True ye are captives, and our country's safety</l>
<l>Forbids, we give you back to liberty:</l>
<l>We give ye therefore to the immortal gods,</l>
<l>To them we lift ye in the radiant cloud</l>
<l>Of sacrifice. They may in limbs of freedom</l>
<l>Replace your free-born souls, and their high mercy</l>
<l>Haply shall to some better world advance you;</l>
<l>Or else in this restore that golden gift,</l>
<l>Which lost, leaves life a burden. Does there breathe</l>
<l>A wretch so 'pall'd with the vain fear of death</l>
<l>Can call this cruelty? 'tis love, 'tis mercy,</l>

<l>I meet the like fair treatment from the foe,</l>

<p>THE few following quotations, from ancient authors, are here thrown together, in order to support and explain some passages in the Drama, that respect the manners of the Druids; and which, the general account of their customs, to be found in our histories of Britain, does not include.</p>

<l>Beside the *sages skill'd in nature's lore:</l>
<p>*<hi>i.e.</hi> The Euvates; one of the three classes of the Druids, according to Am. Marcellinus. Studia liberalium doctrinarum inchoata per Bardos, Euvates, &amp; Druidas. This class, Strabo tells us, had the care of the sacrifices, and studied natural philosophy; which here, by <hi>the changeful universe,</hi> is shewn to be on Pythagorean principles. Whenever the <hi>Priests</hi> are mentioned in the subsequent parts of the Drama, this order of men is intended to be meant, as distinguished from the Druids and Bards.</p>

<head>P. 10. ℣. 2.</head>
<l>Are the milk-white steers prepar'd?</l>
<p>In the minute description which Pliny gives us of the ceremony of gathering the misletoe, he tells us, they sacrificed two white bulls. See Pliny's Natural History, L. 16. c. 44. which Drayton, in his Polyolbion, thus versifies.<l>Sometimes within my shades, in many an ancient wood,</l>
<l>Whose often-twined tops great Phoebus' fires withstood,</l>
<l>The fearless British priests, under an aged oak,</l>
<l>Taking a milk-white bull, unstrained with the yoke,</l>
<l>And with an ax of gold, from that Jove-sacred tree</l>
<l>The misletoe cut down; then with a bended knee</l>
<l>On th' unhew'd altar laid, put to the hallow'd fires;</l>
<l>And whilst in the sharp flame the trembling flesh expires,</l>
<l>As their strong fury mov'd (when all the rest adore)</l>
<l>Pronouncing their desires the sacrifice before,</l>
<l>Up to th' eternal heav'n their bloodied hands did rear:</l>
<l>And whilst the murm'ring woods ev'n shudder'd as with fear,</l>
<l>Preach'd to the beardless youth the soul's immortal state;</l>
<l>To other bodies still how it should transmigrate,</l>
<l>That to contempt of death them strongly did excite.</l>

<l>And the potent adder-stone.</l>
<p>The ovum anguinum, or serpent's egg; a famous Druidical amulet, thus circumstantially described by Pliny.—Praeterea est ovorum genus in magna Galliarum fama, omissum Graecis. Angues innumeri aestate convoluti, salivis faucium corporumque spumis artifici complexu glomerantur; anguinum appellatur. Druidae sibilis id dicunt in sublime jactari, sagoque oportere intercipi, ne tellurem attingat. Profugere raptorem equo, serpentes enim insequi, donec arceantur amnis alicujus interventu, &amp;c. Nat. Hist. Lib. xxix. c. 3.</p>
<p>There are remains of this superstition still, both in the north and west parts of our island. For Lhwyd, the author of the Archeologia, writes thus to Rowland; see Mona Antiqua, p. 338. "The Druid doctrine about the <hi>Glain Neidr,</hi> obtains very much thro' all Scotland, as well lowlands as highlands; but there is not a word of it in this kingdom (Ireland); where, as there are no snakes, they could not propagate it. Besides snake-stones, the highlanders have their snail-stones, paddock-stones, &amp;c. to all which they attribute their several virtues, and wear them as amulets." And in another letter he writes, "The Cornish retain variety of charms, and have still, towards the land's-end, the amulet of Maen Magal, and Glain Neidr, which latter they call a Milpreu, or Melpreu, and have a charm for the snake to make it, when they have found one asleep, and struck a hazel wand in the centre of her spires."</p>

The few and imperfect accounts antiquity gives us of ceremonies, &amp;c. which are unquestionably Druidical, makes it necessary in this, and in other places of the Drama, to have recourse to Tacitus's account of the Germans, amongst whom, if there were really no established Druids, there was certainly a great correspondency, in religious opinions, with the Gauls and Britons. The passage here alluded to is taken from his 10th chapter. Proprium gentis, equorumque quoque praesagia ac monitus experiri. Publice aluntur iisdem nemoribus ac lucis, candidi &amp; nullo mortali opere contacti, quos pressos sacro curru, sacerdos ac rex, vel princeps civitatis comitantur, hinnitus &amp; fremitus observant, nec ulli auspicio major sides non solum apud plebem, sed apud proceres, apud sacerdotes.</p>

<l>Thou art a king, a sov'reign o'er frail man:</l>
<l>I am a Druid, servant of the gods.</l>
<l>Such service is above such sovereignty.</l>
<p>The supreme authority of the Druids over their kings, is thus ascertained by Dion. Chrysostom. <gap resp="oxf" extent="1 span" reason="foreign"/>. Helmodus also de Slavis, l. ii. c. 12. asserts, Rex apud eos modicae est aestimationis in comparatione flaminis.</p>

<l>The time shall come, when destiny and death,</l>

<p>Strabo, and other writers, tell us, the Druids taught, that the world was finally to be destroyed by fire; upon which this allegory is founded.</p>

<l>Behold yon huge</l>
<l>And unhewn sphere of living adamant.</l>
<p>This is meant to describe the rocking-stone, of which there are several still to be seen in Wales, Cornwall, and Derbyshire. They are universally thought, by antiquarians, to be Druid monuments; and Mr. Toland thinks, "that the Druids made the people believe that they only could move them, and that by a miracle, by which they condemned or acquitted the accused, and often brought criminals to confess what could in no other way be extorted from them." 'Twas this conjecture which gave the hint for this piece of machinery. The reader may find a description of one of these rocking-stones in Camden's Britannia, in his account of Pembrokeshire; and also several in Borlase's history of Cornwall.</p>

This adjuration is taken from the literal form of the old Druidical oath, which they administered to their disciples; and which the learned Selden, in Prolog. de Diis Syr. gives us from Vettius Valens Antiochenus, l. vii. It is as follows: <gap resp="oxf" extent="1 span" reason="foreign"/>, &amp;c.</p>

<head>Page 71. ℣. 20.</head>
<l>Near each a white-rob'd Druid, whose stern voice</l>
<l>Thunder'd deep execrations on the foe.</l>
<p>This account is taken from what history tells us did really happen some years after, when the groves of Mona were destroyed by Suetonius Paulinus. Igitur Monam insulam incolis validam, &amp; receptaculum perfugarum aggredi parat, navesque fabricatur plano alveo, adversus breve litus &amp; incertum. Sic Pedes; equites vado secuti, aut altiores inter undas, adnantes equis transmisere. Stabat pro litore diversa acies densa armis virisque, intercursantibus foeminis: in modum Furiarum, veste ferali crinibus dejectis <hi>faces</hi> praeferebant. Druidae circum, preces diras sublatis ad coelum manibus fundentes, novitate aspectus perculere milites ut quasi haerentibus membris, immobile corpus vulneribus praeberent. Dein cohortationibus ducis, &amp; se ipsi stimulantes ne muliebre &amp; fanaticum agmen pavescerent, inferunt signa, sternuntque obvios &amp; igni suo involvunt. Tac. Ann. l. xiv. c. 29.</p>

<l>These shapeless symbols of your barbarous gods.</l>
<p>The Druids did not really worship the divinity under any symbol. But this is put intentionally into the mouth of the Roman, as

mistaking the rude stones placed round the grove, for idols. Thus Lucan in his beautiful description of a Druid grove,<l>—simulacraque moesta deorum</l>
<l>Arte carent caesisque extant informia truncis.</l>
<bibl>Phar. Lib. iii.</bibl></p>
<p>Some imagery from the same description is also borrowed in the opening of the Drama.</p>

<l>—Soldier I had arms.</l>
<p>This passage, and some others in this scene, are taken from Caractacus's famous speech in Tacitus, before the throne of Claudius; but here adapted to his dramatic character.</p>
