<p>THE MAN OF TEN THOUSAND A COMEDY.</p>
<p>AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, DRURY-LANE.</p>
<p>THE SECOND EDITION.</p>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THE character of Major Rampart was intended to represent one of those persons who imagine they have uttered volumes, without having said a word: whose eager looks inform us how important they suppose their own conceptions to be; but, being too mighty for utterance, language sinks under them, and they expect the assent and applause of their companions to their Humphs? Hays? and expletives. These expletives, as used by the Major, are omitted in representation; because they offended. They are here restored, and left to the consideration of the reader. It may be necessary to add, they should not be pronounced in an articulate and emphatical manner; but with a half-muttering rapidity: accompanied by equally rapid glances, looking round for, and demanding, admiration.</p>

<p><stage>(To Lord Laroon)</stage> With submission, my Lord, do you know that impertinent person?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Certainly: so do you. It is Consol; the great Court and City Broker.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, I transact business with him; but I don't know him. I wonder our friend Dorington admits such people.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>P.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh! He is the right hand man of the whole Peerage!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>(Bows)</stage> And of the Baronets to boot, Sir Pertinax.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>P.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes; We have him in turn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>Under correction, the man has all the vulgar insolence of wealth, newly and knavishly acquired.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>P.</hi></speaker>
<p>Very true. The fellow makes himself quite familiar. By the bye, our friend here lives in prodigious splendour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Blow me to atoms! Immensely rich.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>His West India property is incredible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Then his generosity of soul! Humph: Hay? Damme! Unbounded! Humph?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>With great deference <stage>(Looking at them sarcastically)</stage> I wish he had a little more discrimination.</p>

<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>

<speaker>Cur.</speaker>

<p>To be sure! That is natural.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>P.</hi></speaker>
<p>He has not one true friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Well, he can afford it! Do you take me? Humph? Hay? Damme! Humph?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>You are all wrong, and he is right. You do not understand calculation. He has a scheme! A plan! Popularity! Parliament! Pension! Place!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>And perhaps Prime—Humph? Hay? Do you take me? Damme! Humph?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Why does he give such dinners? To serve himself, to be sure! I never ask a man to dinner, that I do not mean to get something by.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>I believe you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Believe me? Ay certainly! You do the same. Why here, now, do I stand prating to you! What do I get by it? Nothing. Then why do I stay? Because I am a fool! If you wanted forty or fifty thousand now, upon good security, and were pinched into a premium, it might be worth my while: but you are a sly filcher. There is nothing to be got by you: so, good night. Sir Pertinax: the Mortgagee will be at my house at two to-morrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>P.</hi></speaker>
<p>I will not fail.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Dorington knows what he is about. Never ask a man to dinner, that you do not mean to get something by. Never! <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>

<p><stage>(Looking after him)</stage> A very contemptible scoundrel!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>P.</hi></speaker>
<p>A pitiful rascal!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>No soul! Humph? Hay? Damme! Only means to pick our friend's pocket, Humph? Hay? Do you take me? Damme! Humph?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why now, Major, you hope for promotion through Dorington's interest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Who, I?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>P.</hi></speaker>
<p>Aided by his purse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Blow me to atoms! I?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>I speak it with great deference, but you have petitioned him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Curfew, you have a very polite way with you; otherwise—But you have remarked how hot I am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, I never saw a man more cool.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>You are pleased to compliment—Stir but my blood and—Gentlemen, I will tell you a story.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Pray do not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>An affair that happened between me and Herr General Von Dondertronc.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>P.</hi></speaker>
<p>I will be gone. My feelings will not suffer me to see my friends make themselves ridiculous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>I know your feelings are prodigiously troublesome to you, Sir Pertinax.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>P.</hi></speaker>
<p>It is my misfortune. Major, go on with your story. You tell it excellently, and often. Adieu. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>I chanced to affirm at Laudohn's Levee (I served the Emperor at that time) to affirm that Frederic the Great commanded the right wing, in person, at the battle of Prague. Mein Herr, said Von Dondertronc, very respectfully taking off his hat (I give you his manner and phrase) Mein Herr, you am a committa mistake a. Carnage and gunpowder, General, said I, interrupting him, do you mean to tell me that I am mistaken? Von Dondertronc was as daring as he was polite. Herr Mayor, said he, for this von littel timea you am a commita mistake a—He knew it was signing his

own death warrant, damme! Humph? Hay? Yet he said it! Blow me to atoms, said I, a barrel of gunpowder! Quick! And a fire-brand! Humph? Hay? Do you take me? Damme! Humph? Contradict me?—Sir, the gunpow—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>With humble submission, Major, you never tell this story twice the same way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen, the gunpowder was brought.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>The last time, you said that, luckily, there was none in the Camp;</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Body of Belzebub!—My Lord, it was an affair of honour. Laudohn, the Generalissimo, attended to see that all was in rule.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>You said he put you both under arrest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Blow me to atoms! Sir, do you tell the story.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>With submission, Sir, I never tell stories that I do not believe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir? Why then, carnage and flames! you are no story-teller. Humph?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Come, come, be merciful, my dear Mr. Curfew. The Major's stories, like himself, are very inoffensive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>I? A soldier inoffensive! Blow me to—Humph? Hay?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, is it not a soldier's duty to keep the king's peace?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Right! Your Lordship is right! Humph? Hay? Damme! I know a soldier's duty! Humph? <stage>[Calls]</stage> Hola! Where are my rascals? <stage>[Enter Footman.]</stage> Order my carriage.</p>

<p>Mr. Curfew, you are a very polite—Humph? Hay? Do you take me? Damme! Humph?</p>

<p>Excuse my temerity, but I do not take—</p>

<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>You beg pardon and make concessions very apropos. Humph? Hay? My Lord? Damme! Humph?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>With great deference, I make no concessions; and should be glad you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Sir, my carriage is waiting. Sir, <stage>(Seriously)</stage> I know a soldier's duty. Do you take me? Humph? Hay? Damme! Humph? <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>

<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Calm yourself, my good Mr. Curfew.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>Under correction, my Lord, I am calm.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Your contradiction and the Major's acquiescence are very amusing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>With deference to your Lordship's superior judgment, I deny what you say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>

<p>With humble submission, of that I doubt.</p>

<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Very well, Mr. Curfew.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>Excuse me, it is not very well. I am not amusing, and have less contradiction than any man breathing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>I perceive, Mr. Curfew, you perfectly know yourself.</p>

<p>Under favour, no man is so easily pleased.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Right, Mr. Curfew, very right! You have it every way! You are neither this, that, nor the other: every thing and nothing: the most facetious, melancholy, complaisant, rude, polite, pleasant, impertinent person I ever beheld.

<p>My Lord! I presume to tell you, though a Peer—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>What is the matter, my good Sir? <stage>(To Lady Taunton)</stage> Let me see you to your carriage.</p>

<p>Who can quit such good company?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>You are a little malicious, I suspect. You are an adorer of Olivia; and wish to rival your friend here?</p>

<p>Let him, if he can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ten to one, now, to-morrow morning, you will tell her I am handed to my carriage, by her lover; nay, will insinuate we have had a tête a tête. You love mischief.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>It is my ambition to vie with your Ladyship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Me? Oh no! In the art of tormenting, I do not know your equal. Good night. Be cautioned. <stage>[Exit: led by Dorington.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>And so, my dear Mr. Curfew, as you were saying, you are the nonpareil of perfection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>With submission, I was not saying any thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh! What, you were lost in astonishment, at the gallantry of Dorington to Lady Taunton? Well, well; don't mention it to your Ward! She is scarcely a being of this age. Accustomed to your perfections, she has no indulgence for these fashionable accommodations. Bon soir! But don't tell Olivia.</p>
<stage>[Exit: bowing to Dorington who returns.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>Pardon my presumption, Sir, but I must say the persons I meet, at your table, do very little honour to your choice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>That, Sir, is your opinion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>Allow me to remark, candour is my character; and there is not one among them but is knave, or fool, or both.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>May be so: what then, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>In my humble judgment, he that associates with such renders himself their equal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! If I will associate with no man who is either knave or rool, I must cage myself at once. Nay, I must never look in a glass; for fear I should happen to meet one where I least expected it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>Under correction, you, Sir, can discover merit where other people can find nothing but deformity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Then, Sir, under correction, I have a pleasure, which I am sorry other people want.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>I am concerned for my Ward's sake.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, leave her and me to settle those points.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, my scruples must be quieted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>I thought I had quieted them all, when I agreed to leave her fortune in your hands, without interest, for a term of six years after the day of marriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>Excuse me, I am not so easily satisfied.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>So it appears.</p>

<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>With submission, your laugh is unmannerly; and I believe she is inclined to break off the match.</p>

<p>Why, if zo be as I might be zo bold.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Ay surely! What should you fear, my good friend?</p>

<speaker>Her.</speaker>
<p>Don't ee cal I your friend: I be but a poor Devonshire lad.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Poor, Herbert? You are the heir of landed property: of which I expect you will very shortly be in possession.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Ay, ay; you ha' bin to law: a drowing away a deal o' your own money, to get me a little o' mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Why, what a contemptible fellow must I have been, Herbert, could I have seen you and Annabel, your orphan cousin, robbed, by a wicked and rapacious executor, and not have done you both right! Speak honestly: <stage>(Leans on his shoulder)</stage> would you have seen me so used?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>Her.</speaker>
<p>Don't ee speak so kindly to I. I do zee you worse used every day of my life; and I can't help it, nether! Al a begging and a borrowing! and you a never zaying nay! Money! Money! I do zee well enough, avore they've adone, they won't leave you a morsel to put i' your mouth.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Well, Herbert, to shew thee that they shall not have all, here, take this; carry it to the poor tradesman, whose goods thou knowest were taken in execution.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Her.</speaker>
<p>Marcy goodness! A hundred pounds?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Tell him to pay his debts with half; and to increase his little stock with the remainder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Her.</speaker>
<p>A hundred pounds!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>We give five hundred for a bauble, to glitter on the finger. Shall we refuse one, to rescue a dozen human beings from famine, and imprisonment?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Her.</speaker>
<p>Zurely! Zurely!—Well may cousin Annabel zay, you be the kindest, best, and most generous gentleman i' the whole wordle.</p>

<p>Not half so good or so kind as herself, Herbert.</p>

<p>Why, tho'f she be my cousin, I can't but zay, a's a kindly zoft zoul.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Well, is she satisfied with her friend, and protectress?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Her.</speaker>
<p>What, Miss Olivia? Marcy dear! How can she be otherguess? Why, she cals cousin Annabel zister; ay and she treats her more reverently, by half, nur many a zister would. But now do 'ee, Zir, bethink you avore hand that, when

<p>Well, make thyself easy, good Herbert; when I have time, I will consider thy advice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Her.</speaker>
<p>Nay but, I do beseech you, don't ee stay till then. No; don't ee, don't ee! Miss Olivia herzel begins to be mortal uneasy about it. And I am zure cousin Annabel and I could never rest in our graves, if as any misvortin should betray you. I do hope you beant angry wi' I for my audacity; but indeed, indeed, I do love your gracious kindness, as I do love my two precious eyes. So pray you now, for God's love, bethink you! Do'ee! Do'ee!

<p>Pshaw! When you sent the card, you should have accompanied it with an old coach and a new coat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Did I not?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hair.</speaker>
<p>No: you only sent me money, to hire one, and buy the other; and I had a different use for that. But come, draw me a cork; instantly. Here! Thomas! A bottle of Burgundy! The

</sp>
<sp>

<p>Baw! Damme now, Dorington, none of your dampers! I am high in luck, high in spirits, and could leap over the moon. You must let me have five hundred directly.</p>

<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Is that all?</p>
</sp>

<p>Oh I would not accept one farthing more. Th s is no rhodomontade! A rational sober plan! By only advancing five hundred pounds, I am to be secured in a thousand a year!</p>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<p>Certain! Damme, said I, Ned Hairbrain, you are a lucky fellow! 'Twill just do you! A thousand a year, you happy dog, will make an emperor of you! Quick! Quick, you tardy rascal, and secure it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>A thousand a year?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hair.</speaker>
<p>Yes. What should I want with more? I will pull up! No more mad freaks! I will be an orderly, sedate, considerate, putt! I will go to bed at ten, get up at six, eat posset, scold my servants, and wear a scratch! Oh! You shall see such a reform!</p>

<p>The advertiser?</p>

<p>Yes, A. B. No. 13, Knave's Acre. All my fear is that I should let it slip.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I will answer for that.</p>

<p>Oh, damme, it will be snatched at! Give

me the money: it will be gone! A. B. told me he has already had five applications: mine was the sixth! But I pleased him. He gave me the preference. My honest good-natured phyz struck him.</p>

<p>Yes. His are the genuine pills! T'other is an impostor. A wonderful discovery! One dose is sufficient! Profits prodigious! Make a cart-load for a crown: sell a single box for a guinea!</p>

<p>And for 500 l. I am to be taken in, as a sleeping partner.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>What shall I say to thee, Ned? Arguments I know are vain: yet to throw money thus absurdly away is painful, to be tricked out of it contemptible, and to become a vender of poison by proxy not much to a man's honour.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>OH, ho, you romantic creature! Ha, ha, ha! Pure undivided hearts? Do you think our handsome fellows and fine women trouble themselves about pure undivided hearts? Lud! They know nothing about hearts. They have no hearts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Nor heads neither, perhaps?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh, no! They have no use for them. Thinking and feeling are out of fashion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="18"/>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Well, they must at least be allowed the virtue of candour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh, yes! To glory in our failings is the essence of good breeding. Hypocrisy and affectation are laughed out of doors.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>I wish folly and effrontery had kept them company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh, you cruel thing! What would become of persons of fashion, without folly and effrontery? They would lose their existence! They would be out of countenance at every word, and blush at every thought!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>They are in no danger: blushes and bloom are become mere articles of perfumery.—Your Ladyship dined in Brook-street, yesterday?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh! With Dorington? Yes. Do you know, I begin to think him a very charming man. I envy you. But—is the match quite certain? Is there no chance of rivalling you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Your Ladyship is the best judge of that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why, I really feel half inclined. I don't know but I may. Beware of me: for, if I set about it, there is danger. I assure you, he was very attentive; and I was very much pleased. I never saw a man more gallant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>I should have hoped you had never seen one less.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Indeed! And why, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>A man attentive to the happiness of others I delight in; but a gallant man is a vender of falsehood by system.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Dear!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>And a character I despise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>I protest you are jealous!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>No. I can renounce; but I cannot condescend to suspect.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="19"/>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well! I declare, I had not the least intention to put you in a flurry!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>A flurry? Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, laugh out! What, you can't? Well, well, I own, you have reason to be alarmed. We, who, from our childhood, have been used to move in the first circles, have always something fascinating in our manner.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Your manners are very marking, indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>I must be going. Good morning. But it is very true: rank will carry it against riches. So, if any thing should happen, do not indulge these violent emotions; nor do not pout, and complain, like a city miss, that your friend has betrayed you, because her attractions had the power that yours wanted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Complain? No, no! I am not so totally a Novice as to complain of unexpected treachery, in a Lady of fashion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>It is very ill bred to be jealous. It is a confession of inferiority. Good bye, my dear. I see you are not well: I will send somebody to you. Good bye. Remember. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Why this is admirable! Can Dorington endure these manners? Can he countenance, can he esteem, or, what is worse, can he affect to esteem, nay, can he coquet with this fashionable Lady? If he can, his heart and mine have no affinity. I seem to have been most miserably mistaken.</p>

<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Dear Madam! What is the matter?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>With whom?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Lady Taunton bade me run to you; for she said you were in a fit!</p>

<p>Better and better!</p>

<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Why did she tell me such an untruth?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>For the joke's sake, I suppose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Oh the wicked!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Sneers and insults are become the commonplace jests of a certain set; who may aptly enough be termed high low life. And with these Dorington associates! These are his friends! They never shall be mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Law, now you are angry again; with mine and my cousin's dear protector!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>The just, the feeling, the delicate mind I only can admire. The sweet intercourse of intelligent and pure souls revolts alike at trivial unmeaning gallantry, clandestine love, and that audacious vice which sets censure at defiance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Dear now! I would not be jealous of my poor Herbert for—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Annabel, you do me wrong: I am not jealous. Mine is a more dignified motive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Dignified motive, dear Lady, is a fine name, but I doubt it is what most people call jealousy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Annabel, I forgive this injustice to your friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Madam, I love you dearly! Dearly! Indeed I do! I am sure my Herbert's Dorington and you were made for one another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>No; we are not! I never can, never will be the wife of the friend of—depravity and vice.</p>

<p><stage>(Interposing)</stage> Your pardon vor that. Wi▪ us, Lords, tho'f they be Lords, don't kiss country cousins.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>But what is the high breeding of Lady Taunton?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Breeding? Breeding? Oh! I recollect. I thought it had escaped you. A very marking trait. Her very first visit, in the morning, to the Lady whom, over night, she had been endeavouring to undo.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Undo?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Undo? No, no! Undo was thewrong word. Too strong. Rather too strong. I merely meant rival.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, her Ladyship's success is certain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>You do not think so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>What can an "unfinished, scarce half made up," simple creature, like myself, oppose; to all a fashionable Lady's borrowed beauties, and bought perfections? Hair sheared from the dead, teeth plucked from the living, a shape bespoke of a mantua-maker, a complexion purchased in Spain, grace imported by figurants, taste by Italian fiddlers, elegance by French courtezans, and manners improved by the polite conversation of grooms, and the attic wit of gamblers!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="19" facs="22"/>
<speaker>Lady <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Very true! And I fairly tell you, this formidable train she now brings to the attack.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>How condescending in her Ladyship! How kind in you! Yet, should she succeed, I do not think your Lordship would feel any exquisite pain?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>How should I? It has long been my ambition to make you a peeress.</p>

<p>Commoner as I am, how shall I return the obligation! Especially when I remember your friendly endeavours to promote a quarrel, between me and Dorington?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Only for the good of all parties!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Oh! To be sure! Then perhaps, to answer this charitable end, a little deviation from the truth now—</p>
</sp>

<p>No! Upon my honour! I have a witness. Herbert!</p>

the very effect you both intended. Present my compliments, therefore, and tell her she need not tax her own ingenuity or your friendship farther.

<p>A dozen, at least, among my own particular friends. Lady Hotwater was terribly cut! Her last stake was a desperate venture.

<p>Ah! Dorington? This is quite apropos! You were the last man in our mouths. You cannot imagine how many things I have been saying in your praise. Have not I, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>You have said a great deal, I own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes: I was telling her what bad success you had last night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Was that in my praise?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>To be sure. What does a hero, like you, mind the loss of a few thousands? Your halfsouled fellows, on such an occasion, will take opium over night, and a pistol the next morning: but you brush such trifles from your mind, as your footman does powder from your coat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>When I am coward enough to commit suicide, it will not be for the loss of money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>I love your spirit. I know no young fellow who has so much. When shall I present the draughts?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Whenever you please. Why do you ask that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>You remember the sum?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>How should I forget?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>How indeed! If it will any way oblige
<pb n="32" facs="35"/>
you, I will forbear a day or two. I am in no immediate want of cash.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>And I am in no immediate want of your forbearance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, don't take pet at my being willing to accommodate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Why should you think I need accommodation?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Is it strange that I should wish to oblige my dearest friend?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Yes; when your dearest friend has no inclination to be obliged.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am really sincere. I have no malice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you have; and I do not like you the worse for it. You are a high-flavoured sauce; a mixture of you is relishing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>We all have our uses. I the sauce, you the turtle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>On which you have the cunning to cut and feed? Yet you are no conjuror.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Conjurors are scarce. I must sly: a hundred calls to make: I shall see you at dinner. Adieu. Don't quarrel. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>This dear friend of yours is in full spirits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>I never knew him otherwise. A very magpie; always hopping and chattering. 'Tis a quality I like in him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Is there any other quality for which you like him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Yes; his frank honest satire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>To torment is his study.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>And he is a master of the art: a proof of his genius.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>He spares neither friend nor foe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>If he did, I should despise him. What
<pb n="33" facs="36"/>
the heart thinks let the tongue utter. Knaves and cowards only fear its freedom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>He has made tolerably free with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart. I am fair game; and he is a fair sportsman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Not too much of that. He advises me to break with you; and offers to dignify me with a coronet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! There is merit even in his impudence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>And are you not offended with him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Not in the least.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Do you esteem me so little?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Fie! I esteem you so much. Your understanding is of too high an order.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>To marry him, when I may have you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Frank, at least.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Certainly. I despise hypocrisy. Why not as freely speak good of myself, when I think it, as of another?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Or ill?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Ay; or ill. I have faults as many as you please: but I have something that will hide them all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Be not too confident. A single cloud will conceal the sun.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>That is a mistake. A few acres I grant may be overcast; but his rays, at the same instant, shine refulgent on the remaining world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Less poetry, and more prudence, might perhaps be as well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Not in your eyes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>You seem very certain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>As I am of my own heart, which beats in unison with yours; or I never could have admired,
<pb n="34" facs="37"/>
never could have loved you as I do. I confess your coldness this morning a little surprises me; and might alarm, were I less acquainted with the justice and the dignity of your mind. My last night's follies offend; and with reason.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>They are indefensible; they are degrading; and yet, comparatively, they are trifles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Indeed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>The loss of wealth only strips vanity of her plumes: but the loss of principle covers us with contempt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Granted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>To preserve our good temper, when the profligate and the absurd surround us, is as worthy of the sage as the man of the world: but to smile approbation, to ape their hypocrisy, and be the high priest of their nocturnal orgies, is to be ambitious of infamy; and to renounce the love and the society of the good.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>A dreadful sentence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>But inevitable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Well, I am now in haste; but, in the course of the evening, I will call, listen to reproof, kiss the rod, and adore the chastiser.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>I may happen not to be at home.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>I'll venture that. Good morrow. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>This self confidence is insulting! Conscious as he is of a dissipated spirit, male coquetry, and depravity of manners, can he so familiarly talk of the unison of our hearts? When he is present, he fascinates! I have but one resource: I will avoid him! Former affection shall not subject me to future wretchedness. Let me be any thing rather than the wife of one whom passion prefers; but whom the understanding rejects. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to see you! My blundering servants are late with the dinner. What is the news?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>I hear there has been a great storm at some of our West India Islands; in which hundreds, some say thousands, of the inhabitants have perished.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Poor wretches!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Your possessions are all there. You may well feel interested.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>That is but natural.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>I hope, my Lord, without pretending to any uncommon degree of benevolence, I should feel a greater desire to save the lives of men than my own possessions; the produce of which, I fear, I have hitherto put to a very indifferent use.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hud.</speaker>
<p>A wreck of nature, rather! Sweeping destruction, and prodigies unheard! The misery is general; though on that side the Island where late your fruitful lands were situate most complete. Your ponderous vessels, mills, stores, and buildings, were wrested from their distracted beds, and swept into the sea! Your vast domains loaded with vegetation, incredible to tell, were torn up and whirled like chaff to the clouds; leaving behind mephitic lakes, whose stench infects the air! Universal nature was convulsed! The elements all waged horrible war; while heart-rending and intolerable cries, roars, and howlings, made the bursting thunder seem a whisper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Blow me to atoms! The siege of Prague, Damme! Humph? Hay?</p>

<p>Kind friends! How can I repay such tenderness! Yours, Sir Pertinax, is truly a most melancholy state! I sympathize with your sufferings! A heart so susceptible! So prodigiously generous! So dangerous sincere! Nay, nay, assuage your griefs!</p>

<p>Damme! Humph? Hay? Humph?</p>

<p>And do you, my dear friends, think Sir Pertinax was the only contemptible person, the only sycophant, the only hypocrite in company?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>I would by no means affirm so bold a thing as that. I can only answer for myself.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Your Lordship is amazingly polite.</p>

<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>Oh a sneering—Humph! Hay? Blow me! Humph?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>But lest you should accuse me of hypocrisy, I will be very sincere. You are a ruined

</sp>

<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>A very obvious one; you will soon lose your senses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>How, and why so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Only for your own convenience. Tasting and smelling will go first. Because, as you know, faculties not exercised are lost. Creditors will next come to your door: animals that have very discordant voices. They will clamour, vociferate, and possess the miraculous gift of making you deaf. They will insolently demand why you are a—Hem!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>They are shocking hard-mouthed scoundrels.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why you are—hem—and they are ruined? Here you will be struck dumb!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Proceed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>They will meet you in the street: and while their eyes shall be riveted upon yours, you will be stone blind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Humph! Why most men's organs are defective; you for instance have a most exquisite taste and scent at a friend's table.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>But never at his own. Blow me! Humph?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Then if your most intimate acquaintance be traduced, no man's ear more open! But if commended, you are instantly as deaf as an adder! I did not say as venomous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>Maj.</speaker>
<p>He has it! Damme! You take me? Humph?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>With respect to vision too, I have known you distinguish a Coronet, on a Coach, at a prodigious distance! Yet unable to see a poor relation, though he brushed your elbow as he passed!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>(To Major &amp;c.)</stage> He can't deny it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Well, Ladies and Gentlemen, by this time we have tolerably well explained ourselves: you have nothing more to hope from me; and I just as much from you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>T.</hi></speaker>
<p>Very sorry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>But how can it be helped?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Be under no concern! We are perfectly agreed. I am as little disposed to accept as you are to offer. I shall indulge in no reproach; for I feel no surprize. I took you for neither better nor worse than you are. Epithets mean but little: I call my dog Caesar; and I have called you my friends: but I did not persuade myself that either you or Caesar were Romans.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>L.</hi></speaker>
<p>Your philosophy is exquisitely polite.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>It is adapted to my company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>For my part, I have only to remark with

great deference, that I cannot, Sir, give you my Ward.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Your reason, kind Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Because, might I hazard an objection, you are a beggar.</p>

<p>Can no consideration bribe you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cur.</speaker>
<p>With submission, none that you can offer. I am sorry, but it is no fault of mine. Your very humble servant, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Thou last and dearest of my friends, farewell! <stage>[Exit Curfew]</stage> Why so! The farce of greatness is ended; and the task of Man begins—'Tis the poor wretches whom the afflicting heavens have left shelterless that demand our pity. Wretched sufferers! Would my loss had been the sole misfortune!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hud.</speaker>
<p>I am glad, Sir, you meet it with so much fortitude.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Not with so much but that I am fool enough to feel it. My cherished hope, the passion of my heart, is cruelly assaulted. But, I know thee, Olivia! Thy pure and dignified love not even this can shake.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hud.</speaker>
<p>So may it prove! Yet the scene I just have witnessed makes me doubt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hud.</speaker>
<p>Your forbearance, with these your false friends, is to me unaccountable. I could have trampled them to dust.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>And thus have reduced yourself to their level. What! A battle with chimney sweepers? Manhood and common sense forbid!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hud.</speaker>
<p>Nay, but malice so undisguised!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>What of it? Shall I be angry that insects buzz and strain to push forth stings they never had?
<pb n="46" facs="49"/>
Or should they blur the mirror that reflects my face, shall I fancy it deformed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hud.</speaker>
<p>After a life of splendour, to become the daily butt of insult and contempt?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Bugbears for children! This man shuts his pocket, and that his door upon me: one overlooks me: another eyes me as steadily forgetful as the stranger that has neither borrowed from my purse nor eaten at my table. Is this worthy my notice? Is it my misfortune or theirs that the first is miserly, the second mean, the third imperious, and the fourth a mere summer-fly, that began in a muckworm and so will end? What, chagrined because I am not like them? Oh, no, no!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hud.</speaker>
<p>I own I cannot think like you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Mere want of thought. Who would make himself the Tantalus of fools, or the foot-ball of fortune?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hud.</speaker>
<p>We are so in our own despite.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Rather by our own endeavours. Equal to every change the man of fortitude remains unmoved, when, most depressed, feebler spirits sink; or, most exalted, flutter. In prosperity he exults not: he shrinks not from adversity. He doubts if there be adversity; except to the impotent and unwise. Souls are distinguished by their qualities; and the day of assault is, to him, the fortunate day in which he proves his rank.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hud.</speaker>
<p>To whom? Poor and deserted, who will notice, he asks not testimony: for if he did, when, where, how often should he meet minds capable of doing him justice? Conscious and secure in himself he needs no other proof.</p>

<p>You talk in vain, Annabel. I know myself. The heart that can unite with mine must be pure as infancy, gay as youth, unshaken as manhood, and benevolent as wisdom in ripe old age.

<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Consol, I thank you for your immediate attention. I want your aid, and fear I have taken a liberty with you, which you may think strange.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Strange, dear Madam? Allow me to say, it is strange you did not take it sooner.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Take what, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>No matter. Better late than never.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>I have a business to propose, to which I am but little accustomed</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I know it, dear Madam! I know it! But what matters custom?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Good sense, I own, Sir, is a better guide.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>No doubt on't! Be under no alarm, Madam; come to the point at once. I know the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Poor Dorington is at present in distress.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay! Poor and in distress. Oh you are a shrewd Lady!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>I am persuaded you will not think me so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Dear Madam, I know you to be so! I never admired any Lady's prudence so much in my life!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>I am glad you approve my proceeding.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Approve? I am transported with it! I adore you for it! Oh, it was a prodigious thought!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="66" facs="69"/>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>A very natural one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>You are a great beauty. So I am a great wit. For why? I can command half a million! Show me another man as witty as myself. Then, as for person, I have a straight leg, a comely face, and a fine eye, for I always see my own interest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>I do not comprehend you, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, dear Madam, speak out, you are shrewd: you know well enough modesty is only a mask.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>It may be so with the knavish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Knavish? All people are knavish at heart, When they are honest it is from a knavish motive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Indeed? Your philosophy is beyond me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I hope no offence, Madam? I would rather the stocks should fall than offend you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside)</stage> What is the matter with the man?—My business with you, Mr. Consol, is an affair of delicacy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Speak; fear nothing, Madam. With the Ladies, no man more delicate than myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>You are gallant, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>To be sure, Madam! You have made me gallant; have fired me; have put my blood in a blaze!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Consol!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Ay, and Mrs. Consol! Is not that it, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside)</stage> Is the man frantic?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I see you will not speak; so I will. I love you, Madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>May my Banker break if I do not! Full fifty per cent. better than ever I loved woman in my life!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="67" facs="70"/>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Amazing!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Not at all. I love you; you love me: there is no love lost. Our purses shall be as loving as our persons: one pocket, one pair of sheets.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I shall expire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Expire, Madam? I would almost rather be a lame duck.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! I dare say, Sir, your grief would be as pungent as your passion is powerful. I know not what odd accident has blown up this flame in your bosom; but I imagine a single word will quench it. You are mistaken.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Me, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Strange as it may seem, even you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>How can that be? You are rich, Dorington is ruined; you are shrewd, I am deep; you are a spinster; I am a bachelor. You sent for me; and having no call for cash, why did you send? To do the deep thing, to be sure; and couple at once our fortunes and our affections.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! How shall I support this extacy of arithmetic! This profusion of fifty per cent. tenderness?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>This Change Alley Cupid! That studies amorous looks in the price of bullion; passionate desires in correct tables of interest; and tumultuous transports according to the rate of Exchange! Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I don't understand, Madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>That falls most woefully in love to the quaaking of lame ducks, and the music of bulls and bears! That kindles up his flame to the sweet harmony of scrip six and a half! Omnium

ten, seven-eighths! Who'll buy? Who'll buy? <stage>(Laughs)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Very odd!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Pardon me, Sir. Indeed I would resist this impertinent laugh, if I could.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>What is there to laugh at in me? Fifty thousand in the long annuities: three times the sum bank stock: and not much less in India Bonds, Consols, and South Sea. Is all that a joke? If it be, it is a devilish good joke! One of the wittiest I ever heard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir, I will leave you in full possession of your wit and jocularity; and, waving farther preface, declare my business.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>And am I then really hummed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Shakes her head)</stage> Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Past all doubt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Then, Madam, you have missed a glorious opportunity; and are not the woman I took you for!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Pray let us be serious, Sir. My business with you requires dispatch. I want an immediate sum of money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Money? That is quite another affair! Money is a very scarce article.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>You forget, Sir? Long Annuities, India Bonds, South Sea?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Forget, Oh no! Can't forget! Never forget! But the terms?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Shall be of your own dictating.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Humph! That's something—And the security?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Is surely undeniable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Oh Lord, Madam! A Ward! Mr. Curfew your guardian! A bill filed in chancery!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="69" facs="72"/>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>I must have money, Sir, of you, or elsewhere.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con</speaker>
<p>Must, I own is an imperious gentleman! Tho' I own I have no dislike to his acquaintance; for he is always willing to hear reason and pay for risk.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>To be sure, Sir. <stage>(Aside)</stage> Yes, Dorington; I will bless even usury; since it will afford thee relief—Please, Sir, to step into my apartment, and we will agree on the terms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I attend you, Madam. But, do now, give the love business a turn in your thought. Pray do! Really I am a jewel! Do wear me in your bosom.</p>
</sp>

<p>Impelled by inexpressible terrors, at the approaching hurricane, I left the island before it happened; and escaped to the ship that brought me to England.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Of whom, then, did you learn the detail you gave me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hud.</speaker>
<p>From various vessels; that all were uniform in their report. I am sorry I have unwittingly been the cause of so painful and false an alarm.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Think not of the pain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hud.</speaker>
<p>The intelligence those letters bring is certain. Sheltered by the high lands, your domains received but little damage; and, from the too general devastation, your crops, which were great, are doubled in value.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Doubled? No! Let me perish indeed, rather than batten on the general distress! Seek a passage; return with all speed; and deal out, to the necessitous, all the relief my crops and stores can supply. But let your aid itself be cautious, and gradual; else, instead of good, it may be mischievous. <stage>[Exit Hudson.</stage></p>

<p>Even so! Why then he is restored to honour and happiness; and I am fallen into the contempt, the scorn, which motives so mean as those imputed to me would well have merited! And who will believe them other than they have appeared? When he was poor, I seemed to abandon him. Now he no longer needs my friendship, I fly to afford him aid!—It must not be! He is lost. Conduct so abject as this shall never be imputed to me!—And is it thus?—A heart so munificent! A soul so capacious! Manners so gentle! Fortitude so unshaken! Is there no hope? Am I for ever cut off from their benignant influence? I am! For ever! He is lost; and annihilation is come upon my soul! <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>TO whining prone, to sighs and sobs and tears,</l>
<l>How much is man the creature of his fears!</l>
<l>Hence grief and lamentation long have been</l>
<l>The serious subject of the comic scene.</l>
<l>Nor knew the hero of the doleful tale</l>
<l>To meet mischance: he knew but to bewail!</l>
<l>Each wind of heaven some swift destruction brought.</l>
<l>The willing slave of every brain-sick thought,</l>
<l>He hunts for woe! For plagues capitulates!</l>
<l>And those he cannot find he soon creates.</l>
<l>The thousand joys he has are all despised:</l>
<l>The toy he cannot get alone is prized:</l>
<l>Give him but wealth, poor churl, he frets and frowns!</l>
<l>Take it away, poor wretch, he hangs or drowns!</l>
<l>Pursued by phantoms, through life's troubled day,</l>
<l>Coward and fool go with him all the way.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>In conscious rectitude confirmed, and bold,</l>
<l>To-night appears a man of different mould:</l>
<l>Who meets misfortune; fate defies; and braves</l>
<l>The rolling thunder; and the surging waves:</l>
<l>Rides safe among the rocks, though tempest-tost,</l>
<l>Where many a tall-built bark lies wrecked and lost.</l>
<l>Poetically rides: but—Thought of fear!</l>
<l>Should one more hurricane o'ertake him, here,</l>
<l>Should bursting yells and howls, from yonder skies,</l>
<l>Bid the wild billows of damnation rise,</l>
<l><pb n="86" facs="88"/>
Courage and skill in vain the storm oppose,</l>
<l>He founders in the gulph, and down he goes!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But should you take the helm, and kindly please</l>
<l>To steer, with pleasant gales, through halcyon seas,</l>
<l>The white sails swelling where the zephyrs sport,</l>
<l>Sweet will the plaudits be that welcome him to port▪</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>ONCE more I'm sent, the Poet's Plenipo',</l>
<l>Your high behest, dread Potentates, to know.</l>
<l>Say, mighty Monarchs! how shall I begin</l>
<l>(Oh that I knew the way!) your hearts to win?</l>
<l>That Critics are unjust is falsely rumour'd:</l>
<l>Then smile, dear sweet Sir Gruff! Do look good humour'd▪</l>
<l>Must Mr. Bays go hang himself? Declare:</l>
<l>Does he deserve damnation and despair?</l>
<l>In gratitude, return of praise is due:</l>
<l>You can't imagine how he praises you!</l>
<l>He vows, in this most great and wise of ages,</l>
<l>That this whole audience are Saints and Sages!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yonder sits Solomon! Socrates, there!</l>
<l>One queu'd and powder'd: t'other cropt and bare.</l>
<l>This a most sapient Whig; that a staunch Tory.</l>
<l>Their country's mutual boast! Old England's glory!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The Greek, a student in the school of taste,</l>
<l>Who cultivates the arts by which he's grac'd,</l>
<l>Sports his half-boots; buttons his half-great coat;</l>
<l>And props his chin with wool-pack round his throat:</l>
<l>With bludgeon arm'd, to knock down those that laugh,</l>
<l>He sallies forth—the Bear and ragged staff!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The Jew—Great Houndsditch never saw his peer!—</l>
<l>The cunning Jew, with ev'ry wind can veer.</l>
<l>"I lend my moneesh, 'cause I lofe de Nation</l>
<l>"I join, mit all my art, to pay taxation.</l>
<l>"De Var and Peesh to me be quite all von,</l>
<l>"Give me but von goot shlish from dat great loaf—de Loan!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet do not think, proud sirs, that we shall own</l>
<l>The genius we admire is yours alone.</l>
<l>We claim our share. Our taste, and wisdom too,</l>
<l>Can equal yours: so let us have our due.</l>
<l>We study the antique! Its simple grace</l>
<l>Shines forth in ev'ry form; and ev'ry face!</l>
<l><pb n="88" facs="90"/>
Thus Lady Candlewick, Sir John just knighted,</l>
<l>Prepares for Court. Like turkey-cock bedighted,</l>
<l>With rosy gills, red plumage, pink and muslin,</l>
<l>And scarlet petticoat, the sattin rustling,</l>
<l>She blazes all abroad! As if she came</l>
<l>To set the Presence-chamber in a flame!</l>
<l>Loaded with dignity, and loops, and laces,</l>
<l>The prototype of <hi>Wenus</hi> and the Graces.</l>
<l>Slim as a Porter butt, tall as a Drum,</l>
<l>With feathers six feet high, behold her come!</l>
<l>Beef-eaters stand abash'd, fall back and stare;</l>
<l>She waddles on with such a Greek, Dutch air!</l>
<l>None can dispute her elegance, and taste:</l>
<l>All must allow my Lady has no waist!</l>
<l>Anxious and proud to captivate beholders,</l>
<l>Her hips have just join'd issue with her shoulders!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>I prate too long; yet, hear me one word more.</l>
<l>Shall I defy, petition, or implore!</l>
<l>Great is your pow'r; and you know how to use it;</l>
<l>None sure would wish, would prompt, you to abuse it.</l>
<l>Our cause is yours; to you that cause we trust:</l>
<l>If merit you perceive, you'll be to merit just.</l>
