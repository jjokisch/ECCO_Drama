<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Piece was finish'd above Two Years ago, and put into my Hands, to make what Use of it I thought fit. And tho' it cost our Author but the Labour of a single Month, or less, yet, upon this Occasion, I can't but think the publishing it will oblige the World, since it is a Sequel to Mr. <hi>Philips </hi>'s Play of Duke <hi>Humfrey,</hi> and an Introduction to Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi>'s Alteration of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third. Never Child had a more regardless Father, than the Parent of this; and therefore rather than have it smother'd, I thought it a more Human Act to let it come upon the Parish. And, in my poor Opinion, I have seen a less promising Appearance than this Brat carries about him, rise in the State.</p>
<l>But if, like <hi>Phaeton,</hi> in <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s Carr,</l>
<l>Th' unequal Muse unhappily should Err,</l>
<l>At least you'll own from glorious Heights he fell,</l>
<l>And there's some Merit in attempting well.</l><bibl>Prol. to XIMENA.</bibl>

<head>ACT I. SCENE I.</head>
<stage>Enter King <hi>Henry.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l><seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>EVER had King less Joy in Rule than I,</l>
<l>Nor more Misfortune; Heaven was pleas'd to set</l>
<l>My Cradle on the Top of humane Glory,</l>
<l>Where I lay helpless, to all Storms expos'd;</l>
<l>My childish Hand, not able to support</l>
<l>My Father's Sword, dropt the victorious Point,</l>
<l>And let fall all the Laurels that adorn'd it;</l>
<l>And <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> ravag'd for the Spoil.</l>
<l>So lost I <hi>France;</hi> now am I threatned too</l>
<l>By wicked Rebels, with the Loss of <hi>England:</hi></l>
<l><hi>Cade</hi> and <hi>Plantagenet</hi> joyn to undo me.</l>
<l>Never did Subject long to be a King,</l>
<l>As I do long, and wish to be a Subject.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter the Queen, attended.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>Health and good Tidings to your Majesty;</l>
<l>The Villain <hi>Cade,</hi> is kill'd by brave young <hi>Clifford.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>Kill'd!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>He is kill'd, my Lord; and all his Powers do yield,</l>
<l>And wait your Highness Doom, of Life, or Death.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>Their Fault was great, 'tis true; but their Submission</l>
<l>Now cancels that, and they shall meet my Mercy.</l>
<l>Therefore with pleasing Pardon to them all,</l>
<l>I do dismiss 'em to their several Homes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>Kings should have Mercy, but with it Justice too.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>Just Heaven accept my Vows of Thanks and Praise,</l>
<l>For having sav'd the Lives of my poor People.</l>
<l>I swear I am more pleas'd to see this End,</l>
<l>Without the Shedding my poor Subjects Blood,</l>
<l>Than I should be to conquer the whole World</l>
<l>By Slaughter—but—Ha! old <hi>Clifford</hi> weeping.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Old <hi>Clifford.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>Yes, Sir, I weep; but I weep Tears of Joy;</l>
<l>For I am crush'd between Two mighty Joys,</l>
<l>Your Royal Safety, and my Son's Success.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Young <hi>Clifford,</hi> and kneels.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>O gallant <hi>Clifford!</hi> how shall I reward thee?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>I fought not for Rewards; or if I did,</l>
<l>I ought to end my Work e'er I be paid.</l>
<l>I have only now pull'd down a paltry Scaffold,</l>
<l>On which <hi>Plantagenet</hi> design'd to climb,</l>
<l>To build his trayt'rous Projects—Have you not heard</l>
<l>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> is newly come from <hi>Ireland;</hi></l>
<l>And with a puissant and mighty Power,</l>
<l>Is marching hitherwards in proud Array.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>True, he approaches with a mighty Host,</l>
<l>But he gives out, he only does intend</l>
<l>To drive away from me some wicked Ministers.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>The constant Vizard of Rebellion.</l>
<l>Rebellion is so foul and grim a Monster,</l>
<l>That those who mount the horrid Beast are forc'd</l>
<l>To cover it all o'er with gawdy Trappings.</l>
<l>They mark it in the Forehead with white Stars,</l>
<l>Pretences heavenly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, Sir—he tells you nought but Truth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>Thus stands my State, 'twixt <hi>Cade</hi> and <hi>York</hi> distrest,</l>
<l>Like to a Ship, that having scap'd a Tempest</l>
<l>Is straitway calm'd, and boarded with a Pirate.</l>
<l>I pray thee, old <hi>Clifford,</hi> go and meet him,</l>
<l>And ask him what's the Reason of these Arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
<speaker>O. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>I will, my Lord, and doubt not so to deal,</l>
<l>As all Things shall redound unto your Good.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>Come Wife, let's in, and learn to govern better;</l>
<l>For yet may <hi>England</hi> curse my wretched Reign.</l>
<stage>[Exeunt.</stage>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>York, Edward, George, Richard,</hi> and Soldiers.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l>From <hi>Ireland</hi> thus comes <hi>York</hi> to claim his Right,</l>
<l>And pluck the Crown from feeble <hi>Henry</hi>'s Head.</l>
<l>Oh holy Majesty! who would not buy thee dear,</l>
<l>Let them obey that know not how to rule.</l>
<l>This Hand was made to handle nought but Gold.</l>
<l>I cannot give due Action to my Words,</l>
<l>Except a Sword or Sceptre ballance it.</l>
<l>A Scepter shall it have. Have I a Soul!</l>
<l>On which I'll toss the Flower de Luce of <hi>France.</hi></l>
<stage>Enter Old <hi>Clifford.</hi></stage>
<l>Whom have we here? old <hi>Clifford</hi> to disturb me?</l>
<l>The King hath sent him sure—I must dissemble.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Cliff.</speaker>
<l><hi>York,</hi> if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l><hi>Clifford</hi> of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> I accept thy Greeting.</l>
<l>Art thou a Messenger, or come of Pleasure?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>A Messenger from <hi>Henry</hi> our dread Liege,</l>
<l>To know the Reason of these Arms in Peace?</l>
<l>Or why, thou being a Subject, as I am,</l>
<l>Against thy Oath, and true Allegiance sworn,</l>
<l>Should raise so great a Pow'r without his Leave;</l>
<l>Or dare to bring thy Force so near the Court?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l>Scarce can I speak, my Choler is so great.</l>
<l>Oh! I could hew up Rocks, and fight with Flint,</l>
<l>I am so angry at these abject Terms:</l>
<l>And now, like frantick <hi>Ajax,</hi></l>
<l>On Sheep, or Oxen, could I spend my Fury.</l>
<l>I am far better born than is the King;</l>
<l>More like a King, more kingly in my Thoughts.</l>
<l>But I must make fair Weather yet a while,</l>
<l>Till <hi>Henry</hi> be more weak, and I more strong. <stage>[aside.]</stage></l>
<l>O <hi>Cumberland,</hi> I prithee pardon me,</l>
<l>That I have giv'n no Answer all this while.</l>
<l>My Mind was troubled with deep Melancholy,</l>
<l>The Cause why I have brought this Army hither,</l>
<l>Is to remove proud <hi>Somerset</hi> from the King,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="7"/>
Seditious to his Grace, and to the State.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>That is too much Presumption on thy Part.</l>
<l>But if thy Arms be to no other End,</l>
<l>The King hath yielded unto thy Demand:</l>
<l>The Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> is in the Tower.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l>Upon thy Honour, Is he Prisoner?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>Upon my Honour, he is Prisoner.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l>Then, noble <hi>Clifford,</hi> I'll dismiss my Pow'rs,</l>
<l>And let my Sovereign, virtuous <hi>Henry,</hi></l>
<l>Command my eldest Son; nay, all my Sons,</l>
<l>As Pledges of my Fealty and Love;</l>
<l>I'll send 'em all, as willing as I live.</l>
<l>Lands, Goods, House, Armour, every Thing I have,</l>
<l>Is to his Use, so <hi>Somerset</hi> may die.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Cliff.</speaker>
<l><hi>York,</hi> I commend this kind Submission;</l>
<l>And I am sure 'twill glad King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Heart,</l>
<l>Come, let us Two go friendly to the King.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter King <hi>Henry,</hi> attended.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l><hi>Clifford,</hi> doth <hi>York</hi> intend no Harm to us,</l>
<l>That thus he marches with thee Arm in Arm.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l>In all Submission and Humility,</l>
<l><hi>York</hi> doth present himself unto your Highness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>Then what intend these Forces thou dost bring.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l>To have the Traytor <hi>Somerset</hi> from hence,</l>
<l>And fight against that monstrous Rebel <hi>Cade;</hi></l>
<l>Who since, I hear, is overcome and slain.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter the Queen, and <hi>Somerset.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>See, old <hi>Clifford; Somerset</hi> comes with the Queen;</l>
<l>Go bid her hide him quickly from the Duke.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>For thousand <hi>Yorks</hi> he shall not hide his Head,</l>
<l>But boldly stand, and front him to his Face.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l>How now? Is <hi>Somerset</hi> at Liberty?</l>
<l>Then <hi>York</hi> unloose thy long imprison'd Thoughts,</l>
<l>And let thy Tongue be equal with thy Heart.</l>
<l>Shall I endure the Sight of <hi>Somerset?</hi></l>
<l>False King, why hast thou broken Faith with me,</l>
<l>Knowing how hardly I can brook Abuse?</l>
<l>King, did I call thee? no, thou art no King,</l>
<l>Nor fit to govern and rule Multitudes,</l>
<l>Who has not Power to rule a single Traytor:</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="8"/>
That Head of thine doth not become a Crown;</l>
<l>Thy Hand is made to grasp a Palmer's Staff,</l>
<l>And not to grace an awful princely Scepter:</l>
<l>That Gold must round engirt these Brows of mine,</l>
<l>Whose Smile and Frown, like to <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Spear,</l>
<l>Is able, with the Change, to kill and cure;</l>
<l>Here is a Hand to hold the Scepter up,</l>
<l>And, with the same, to act controuling Laws:</l>
<l>Give Place; by Heav'n thou shalt rule no more</l>
<l>O'er him, whom Heav'n created for thy Ruler.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Som.</speaker>
<l>O, monstrous Traytor! I arrest thee, <hi>York,</hi></l>
<l>Of capital Treason 'gainst the King and Crown.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l><hi>Somerset,</hi> in whose Name do you arrest me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Som.</speaker>
<l>In the King's Name.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l>Then I'll unfold my self;</l>
<l>Know, hitherto I've been like a dark Cloud,</l>
<l>Where scorching Heat has been engendring Thunder;</l>
<l>The Grumbling and the Rowling you have heard,</l>
<l>And now the deadly Bolt shalt light among you:</l>
<l>I am your King.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>Ha!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l>Yes, I am your King,</l>
<l>Sprung from the Royal House of <hi>Clarence,</hi></l>
<l>Whom three Usurpers of the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi></l>
<l>Successively, have trodden under Feet,</l>
<l>Whilst they have glitter'd in our Royal Glory,</l>
<l>Shone like false Diamonds in our Purple Robes.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter young <hi>Clifford.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>Health and all Happiness to my Lord the King.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l>I thank thee, <hi>Clifford,</hi> say, What News with thee?</l>
<l>Nay, think not to fright me with an angry Look,</l>
<l>We are thy Sovereign, <hi>Clifford,</hi> kneel thee down,</l>
<l>For thy mistaking so we pardon thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>This is my King, <hi>York,</hi> I do not mistake,</l>
<l>But thou mistakest much to think I do.</l>
<l>To <hi>Bedlam</hi> with him—Is the Man grown mad?</l>
</sp>

<l>Ay, <hi>Clifford,</hi> Frenzy and ambitious Humour</l>
<l>Make him oppose himself against his King!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>Did we not tell you this?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>And we will tell you more, obey your King,</l>
<l>I mean, my Royal Father, or our Swords</l>
<l>Shall turn the Arrest of Treason on your selves.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>
<speaker>O. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>Surely you think you are among your Beauties,</l>
<l>Amorous <hi>Edward,</hi> there your Valour lies.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>Let them admire thy Boasts, here art thou scorn'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>'Tis said, when the brave Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> liv'd,</l>
<l>Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> would not contemn a Lover;</l>
<l>I'm young, and love, but yet I am not stricken</l>
<l>So blind with Beauty, but I can discern</l>
<l>Both the fair Kingdom, and the fair Queen, lie</l>
<l>Sick of the Impotence of a weak King.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>Ill manner'd Insolence!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>Why, what a brood of Traytors have we here?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>York.</speaker>
<l>Look in a Glass, and call thy Image so;</l>
<l>I am thy King, and thou a false hearted Traytor.</l>
<l>I've declar'd my Right, and here are my three Sons</l>
<l>To plead it with their Swords. Now I'll produce</l>
<l>The Sword of the Victorious Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi></l>
<l>Call in the Earl.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Warwick.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>Thou against me, <hi>Warwick!</hi></l>
<l>Say, didst thou never swear Allegiance to me,</l>
<l>And canst dispense with Heav'n for such an Oath?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<l>It is great Sin to swear unto a Sin,</l>
<l>But greater Sin to keep a sinful Oath:</l>
<l>Who can be bound by any solemn Vow,</l>
<l>To do a murderous Deed, to rob a Man,</l>
<l>To force a spotless Virgin's Chastity,</l>
<l>To 'reave the Orphan of his Patrimony,</l>
<l>And have no other Reason for his Wrong,</l>
<l>But that he was bound to't by solemn Oath?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>A subtle Traytor needs no Sophister.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<l>Cause I ador'd an Idol once, in Ignorance,</l>
<l>Must I still do so, now I see my Error?</l>
<l>Know, Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (for you are no more)</l>
<l><hi>Henry,</hi> your Grandfather, murder'd his King,</l>
<l><hi>Richard</hi> the Second; not content with that,</l>
<l>He trampled on the Rights of the next Heirs.</l>
<l>Your Father, warlike <hi>Henry,</hi> I confess,</l>
<l>Had in Desert what he did want in Title:</l>
<l>But Merit makes no lawful Claim to Crowns,</l>
<l>For if it did, I wou'd be King of <hi>England;</hi></l>
<l>But I will tell you to your Face, Duke <hi>Henry,</hi></l>
<l>That you have neither Title nor Desert.</l>

<speaker>Queen. O. Cliff. Y. Cliff. Som.</speaker>
<l>Most impudent of Traytors.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<l>I'll speak Truth,</l>
<l>And value not the Fury of you all;</l>
<l>Your Father <hi>Henry</hi> was a Wall of Steel,</l>
<l>Thro' which there was no Passage to the Throne,</l>
<l>But you are only a soft silken Curtain,</l>
<l>Which with my Hand, or Breath, I'll put aside,</l>
<l>And seat your self, King <hi>Richard,</hi> in the Throne,</l>
<l>For it is empty tho' the Duke be there.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Cliff.</speaker>
<l>What, have these Traytors conquer'd us already,</l>
<l>They talk at this bold Rate? Thou Traytor <hi>Warwick,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Warwick,</hi> no! when thou dethron'st thy King</l>
<l>Thou mad'st thy self a Groom, by the same Law</l>
<l>Thou tramplest on thy King; a sawcy Groom</l>
<l>May set his dirty Foot upon thy Jaws,</l>
<l>And tell thee they were made both of one Clay.</l>

<l>All this loud Noise and Fury you have heard</l>
<l>Is but the Crackling of some burning Thorn,</l>

<l>Who can be patient in such sad Extremes?</l>
<l>Oh wretched Man, wou'd I had dy'd a Maid,</l>

E'er I had stoop'd to such unnatural Baseness.</l>

<l>By one base Deed he has undone us all.</l>

<l>You may bestow your Kingdom whilst you live,</l>
<l>But when you are dead, the Crown by Right is mine,</l>
<l>And by the sacred Memory of my Ancestors,</l>
<l>I'll bear no Head that does not wear a Crown.</l>
</sp>

<l>My Son, he shall not disinherit thee,</l>
<l>I have Men here to guard us from the Rebels,</l>

<l>One that was a woful Looker on,</l>
<l>When as the noble Duke of <hi>York</hi> was slain,</l>
<l>Your princely Father, and my noble Lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>

<l>Environ'd he was with many Foes,</l>
<l>And stood against 'em, as the Hope of <hi>Troy</hi></l>
<l>Against the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that would have enter'd there.</l>
<l>But <hi>Hercules</hi> himself must yield to odds;</l>
<l>And many Strokes, tho' with a little Ax,</l>
<l>Hews down, and fells the hardest timber'd Oak.</l>
<l>By many Hands your Father was subdu'd,</l>
<l>But only slaughter'd by the ireful Arm</l>
<l>Of unrelenting <hi>Clifford,</hi> whilst the Queen</l>
<l>Laugh'd in his Face; and when with Grief he wept,</l>
<l>The ruthless Queen, gave him to dry his Cheeks,</l>
<l>A Napkin steeped in the harmless Blood</l>
<l>Of sweet young <hi>Rutland,</hi> by rough <hi>Clifford</hi> slain;</l>
<l>And after many Scorns, many foul Taunts,</l>
<l>They took his Head, and on the Gates of <hi>York</hi></l>
<l>They set the same, and there it doth remain</l>
<l>The saddest Spectacle that e'er was view'd.</l>

<l>I cannot weep, for all my Body's Moisture</l>
<l>Scarce serves to quench my Furnace burning Heart.</l>
<l>Nor can my Tongue unload my Heart's great Burden,</l>
<l>For the same Wind that I shou'd speak withal,</l>
<l>Is kindling Coals that fire up all my Breast;</l>
<l>And burn me up with Flames that Tears would quench.</l>
<l>To weep is to make less the Depth of Grief;</l>
<l>Tears then for Babes, but dear Revenge for me.</l>

<l>Now, noble Lords, tell me what News abroad.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>O <hi>Warwick! Warwick!</hi>—great <hi>Plantagenet</hi></l>
<l>Is by the stern Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> put to Death.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<l>Some Time ago I drown'd this News in Tears,</l>
<l>After the bloody Fray at <hi>Wakefield</hi> fought,</l>
<l>Where your brave Father breath'd his latest Gasp;</l>
<l>Tidings, as swiftly as the Post could run,</l>
<l>Were brought me of your Loss, and his Depart.</l>
<l>I then in <hi>London,</hi> Keeper of the King,</l>
<l>Muster'd my Soldiers, gather'd Flocks of Friends,</l>
<l>March'd towards St. <hi>Albans</hi> to intercept the Queen.</l>
<l>Bearing the King, in my Behalf, along;</l>
<l>For by my Scouts I was advertis'd,</l>
<l>That she was coming with a full Intent</l>
<l>To dash our late Decrees in Parliament,</l>
<l>Touching King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Oaths, and your Succession.</l>
<l>Short Tale to make, we at St. <hi>Albans</hi> met,</l>
<l>Our Battles join'd, and for long Time we fought;</l>
<l>But whether 'twas the Coldness of the King,</l>
<l>Who look'd full gently on his warlike Queen,</l>
<l>That robb'd my Soldiers of their heated Spleen;</l>
<l>Or, whether 'twas Report of her Success,</l>
<l>Or more than common Fear of <hi>Clifford</hi>'s Vigor,</l>
<l>Who thunders to his Captives Blood and Death,</l>
<l>I cannot judge, but to conclude with Truth,</l>
<l>Their Weapons like to Light'ning came and went;</l>
<l>Our Soldiers, like the Night-Owls lazy Flight,</l>
<l><pb n="27" facs="30"/>
Or like a lazy Thrasher with his Flail,</l>
<l>Fell gently down, as if they struck their Friends;</l>
<l>I cheer'd 'em up with Justice of our Cause,</l>
<l>With Promise of high Pay, and great Reward,</l>
<l>But all in vain, they had no Heart to fight;</l>
<l>And we in them no Hope to win the Day,</l>
<l>So that we fled; the King unto the Queen,</l>
<l>Lord <hi>George,</hi> your Brother; <hi>Norfolk</hi> and my self,</l>
<l>With th' utmost speed, are come to join with you;</l>
<l>For in the Marshes here we heard you were,</l>
<l>Making another Head to fight again.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Where is the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> noble <hi>Warwick?</hi></l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>Some four Miles off the Duke is with the Soldiers,</l>
<l>And for your Brother, he was lately sent</l>
<l>From your kind Aunt, Dutchess of <hi>Burgundy,</hi></l>
<l>With needful Aid of Soldiers to this War,</l>
<l>And ev'ry Minute I expect him here.</l>
</sp>

<l>'Twas Odds belike, when valiant <hi>Warwick</hi> fled;</l>
<l>Oft have I heard his Praises in Pursuit,</l>
<l>But ne'er till now, his Scandal of Retreat.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>War.</speaker>
<l>Nor now my Scandal, <hi>Richard,</hi> Dost thou hear?</l>
<l>For thou shalt know this strong right Hand of mine,</l>
<l>Can pluck the Diadem from faint <hi>Henry</hi>'s Head,</l>
<l>And wring the awful Scepter from his Hand,</l>
<l>Were he as famous, and as bold in War,</l>
<l>As he is fam'd for Mildness, Peace, and Prayer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<l>I know it well, Lord <hi>Warwick,</hi> blame me not,</l>
<l>'Tis Love I bear thy Glories makes me speak.</l>
<l>But in this busy Time, what's to be done?</l>
<l>Shall we go throw away our Coats of Steel,</l>
<l>And wrap our Bodies in black Mourning Gown,</l>
<l>Numb'ring our <hi>Ave Maries</hi> with our Beads?</l>
<l>Or, shall we on the Helmets of our Foes</l>
<l>Tell our Devotion with revengeful Arms,</l>

<l>Then once again let's stride our foaming Steeds,</l>
<l>And once again cry Charge upon our Foes,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Gent.</speaker>
<l>A beauteous Lady, attir'd in Widow's Weeds,</l>
<l>Intreats Admission to your Majesty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Admit her instantly.</l>
<stage>[Exit Gent.</stage>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Lady <hi>Grey.</hi> She kneels, and delivers a Petition. The King gazes on her.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>Sir, I present you humbly the Petition</l>
<l>Of a poor Widow, and her little Orphans.</l>
<l>I am the Relict of one Sir <hi>John Grey,</hi></l>
<l>Who in St. <hi>Alban</hi>'s Battle lost his Life,</l>
<l>In the Defence of him we thought our King.</l>
<l>If my poor Husband's Loyalty did err,</l>
<l>He dearly for that fatal Error paid.</l>
<l>My humble Prayer is, that my poor Orphans</l>
<l>May not be punish'd for their Father's Faults,</l>
<l>If erring Loyalty can be a Fault.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>I ne'er had Eyes, or my Eyes ne'er saw Beauty</l>
<l>Till this amazing Minute.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<l>So! he's lost,</l>
<l>And any one may have <hi>England</hi> now that will.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>May it please your Highness to resolve me now,</l>
<l>And what your Pleasure is shall satisfy me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<l>Ay, Widow, then, I'll warrant you, all your Lands,</l>
<l>If that which pleases him shall pleasure you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>I am so rapp'd, I mind not what she says,</l>
<l>Nor that she is all this while upon her Knees.</l>
<l>Pray, Madam, rise—leave us.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="35" facs="38"/>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<l>Yea, is it so?</l>
<l>I see the Lady hath a Thing to grant</l>
<l>Before the King will grant her humble Suit.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>If I forget not, you said you had a Husband</l>
<l>Who in St. <hi>Alban</hi>'s Battle lost his Life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>Yes, Sir, I had, his Name was Sir <hi>John Grey.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>What Excellence had he above Mankind,</l>
<l>That he shou'd be more blest than all the rest?</l>
<l>How many Children have you, Lady? Tell me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<l>I think he means to beg a Child of her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<l>Nay, then hang me, he'll rather give her two.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>Three, my most gracious Lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<l>You shall have Four if you'll be rul'd by him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Oh wondrous, happy Man, to enjoy this Woman!</l>
<l>I must enquire about her, I was never,</l>
<l>Never so charm'd before—my Lord, come hither,</l>
<l>Pray do you know this Lady?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord.</speaker>
<l>Yes, Sir, well,</l>
<l>She is the Widow of the late Sir <hi>John Grey,</hi></l>
<l>A Man of noble Blood, and great Estate,</l>
<l>But a most vehement <hi>Lancastrian.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>No Matter: Of what Family is she?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord.</speaker>
<l>Her Quality does far exceed her Husband's,</l>
<l>And yet her Vertue does exceed her Quality;</l>
<l>She is the Daughter of Sir <hi>Richard Woodvil,</hi></l>
<l>Her Mother was sometime Dutchess of <hi>Bedford,</hi></l>
<l>And Daughter of the Earl of St. <hi>Pool.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Of noble Birth, and by her Mother's Side</l>
<l>Related to the House of <hi>Lancaster.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord.</speaker>
<l>She is by Marriage, Sir, that was the Cause</l>
<l>That Sir <hi>John Grey</hi> was such a fierce <hi>Lancastrian.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>She has Beauty, Vertue, joyn'd with noble Birth;</l>
<l>Why may not this fair Lady be a Queen?</l>
<l>But she's a Subject, <hi>England</hi> will not like it;</l>
<l>And the <hi>English</hi> Nation, like the Sea it governs,</l>
<l>Is bold and turbulent, and easily mov'd,</l>
<l>And always beats against the Shore that bounds it.</l>
<l>What, are the People free, and not the King?</l>
<l>Not free, where every Slave is free, his Bed;</l>
<l>Ay, so it is it seems, and th' <hi>English</hi> Fury,</l>
<l>Will easily with any Wind be rais'd,</l>
<l>To dash the Palaces and Peace of Kings.</l>
<l>Come what will come, this Lady shall be mine;</l>
<l>She shall be, or my Mistress, or my Wife.</l>
<l><pb n="36" facs="39"/>
What was it, Madam, you desir'd of me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>To give poor Orphans, Sir, their Father's Lands.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Heaven forbid I shou'd retain 'em from 'em.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>Then, Sir, with humble Thanks, I take my leave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Hold, Madam, for I must have one Word more.</l>
<l>Pray tell me, Madam, Do you love your Children?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>More dearly, Sir, than I do love my self.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>And wou'd you not do much to do them good?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>To do them good I wou'd sustain much harm.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>I must impose a Tax upon this Land.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>It shall be thankfully and gladly paid.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>It will, I'm sure, more gladly be receiv'd.</l>
<l>It is an easy Tax, no more but Love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>No Loyal Subject, Sir, but loves their King.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>But this is Love that none but you can grant.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>I do not understand your Meaning, Sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Truly I scarcely understand my self.</l>
<l>For I have gaz'd my self out of my Reason.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>With your Permission, Sir, I take my Leave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Oh, you shall never, never, part from me!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>Alas! what mean you, Sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>I mean all the Love</l>
<l>E'er was, or can be, in the Heart of Man.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>Oh, Royal Sir, I dare not understand you,</l>
<l>Because I dare not think Ill of my Prince.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Can there be ill in Love? There will be all</l>
<l>The Happiness to me, Glory to you,</l>
<l>Your Heart and mine can possibly desire.</l>
<l>Why do you tremble, and draw back your Hand?</l>
<l>You must not, shall not stir, till you have granted</l>
<l>What all this Languishing and Pressing mean.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>Oh, I shall swoon! Wou'd I had ne'er come here.</l>
<l>Sir, I thus low most humbly beg of you,</l>
<l>Let it suffice your conquering Arms have seiz'd</l>
<l>My Husband's Life, your Laws have seiz'd his Lands,</l>
<l>Seek not to take my Honour, and my Vertue.</l>
<l>I never fought against you, ne'er oppos'd you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Her Looks do argue her repleat with Modesty.</l>
<l>Her Words do show her Sense incomparable.</l>
<l>All her Perfections challenge Sovereignty;</l>
<l>I wrong her therefore, she deserves a Crown,</l>
<l>And each Look claims a Kingdom as its due.</l>
<l>Madam, I mean nothing but Honour to you,</l>
<l>I am resolv'd to make you Queen of <hi>England.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="37" facs="40"/>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>Now, Sir, you mean Dishonour to your self;</l>
<l>I am as much unworthy to be Queen,</l>
<l>As I'm above serving an ill Design.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Rather, the Crown's unworthy of your Beauty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>It is impossible you shou'd descend</l>
<l>To such mean Thoughts.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>It is impossible</l>
<l>I shou'd have Happiness without your Love.</l>
<l>I had rather with your Love be your dead Husband,</l>
<l>Than with your Hatred be a living King.</l>
<l>Therefore consider well what you will do.</l>
<l>Think on the Extravagance of my Passion;</l>
<l>Think how very great or miserable</l>
<l>My Power can make you, and remember too,</l>
<l>You said you were fond of all your Children,</l>
<l>And that to do them Good you cou'd bear Harm.</l>
<l>And now, behold a King, who courts both you</l>
<l>And them to Wealth, Pomp, and Royal Greatness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>Heav'n instruct me what Answer I shall make.</l>
<l>Who knows how far his Passion, back'd with Power,</l>
<l>May hurry him to ruin me and mine:</l>
<l>If I should not consent unto his Will,</l>
<l>I, by denial, ruin our whole House.</l>
<l>When I, by yielding, bear the Storm alone,</l>
<l>I rather will consent to sacrifice</l>
<l>My self, than see my poor little Orphans</l>
<l>Reduc'd to Shame, to Want, and Beggary;</l>
<l>That Thought strikes more Poniards into my Heart,</l>
<l>Than my consenting unto <hi>Edward</hi>'s Love.</l>
<l>Oh, that I only were concern'd in this! <stage>[aside.</stage></l>
<l>I lately wish'd I never had come here,</l>
<l>For my own sake, I wish it now for yours.</l>
<l>Oh think, Sir, what will all your Subjects say!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>They'll say I am in Love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>But will they not</l>
<l>Be much displeas'd their Prince shou'd love so low.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>I give them leave to chuse where they like best,</l>
<l>And shall I be the only Man impos'd on.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. G.</speaker>
<l>But you have sent to Court a foreign Princess,</l>
<l>May bring your Kingdom great Advantages,</l>
<l>Consider how you may enrage Lord <hi>Warwick.</hi></l>

<l>And have I fought only to give you Joys?</l>
<l>What, must not I too have an equal Share?</l>
<l>I have my Passions, Sir, as well as you.</l>
<l>Whence do those Passions spring, from childish Love?</l>
<l>No, from manly Greatness; all other Fondness</l>
<l>I've banish'd from this rude tough Breast of mine,</l>
<l>For I'm not made to please a wanton Eye.</l>
<l>Then, what will satisfy my Appetite?</l>
<l>Nought but a Crown, it hangs within my sight,</l>

<l>O'er all the Heads that are 'twixt me and that</l>
<l>But I will reach it—my Arm must then be long,</l>
<l>For say that <hi>Edward</hi>'s Title's buried,</l>

To take their Rooms, e'er I can place my self.</l>
<l>A cold Premeditation for my Purpose.</l>
<l>Why then do I but dream on Sovereignty?</l>
<l>Like one that stands upon a Promontory,</l>
<l>And spies afar off Shore, which he wou'd tread,</l>
<l>Wishing his Foot were equal with his Eye;</l>
<l>And chides the Sea that sunders him from thence,</l>
<l>Saying, he'll lave it dry, to have his Way.</l>
<l>So flatter I my self with Things impossible.</l>
<l>How rarely wou'd the long Regal Robe</l>
<l>Hide my Deformity of Back and Legs?</l>
<l>How wou'd a Sceptre grace this shrunk up Arm?</l>
<l>And, Oh! what Beauty is there in a Crown?</l>
<l>And till I gain it I do live in Torment.</l>
<l>Shall I then stand like one lost in a Wood,</l>
<l>And rather bear the pricking of the Thorns,</l>
<l>Than stain my Sword by hewing out my Way?</l>
<l>Why do I not set this Brain of mine to work,</l>
<l>And frame my Countenance to all Occasions?</l>
<l>I'll play the Orator as well as <hi>Nestor,</hi></l>
<l>Deceive more slyly than <hi>Ulysses</hi> cou'd,</l>
<l>And like a <hi>Sinon</hi> take another <hi>Troy.</hi></l>
<l>I can add Colours to the <hi>Camelion,</hi></l>
<l>And, for Advantage, can change Shapes with <hi>Proteus.</hi></l>
<l>Have I endur'd all Hazards of the War,</l>
<l>Only to see this lustful <hi>Edward</hi> reign?</l>
<l>Have both my Hands, for him, been wash'd in</l>
<l>Blood—</l>
<l>And shall they not dare do the same for me?</l>
<l>Soft Time, and Cunning, and a daring Mind,</l>
<l>Shall set this wish'd for Crown upon my Head?</l>
<l>Some Men, perhaps, will say by Villany,</l>
<l>That's Villany, which by its ill Success,</l>
<lg>
<l><hi>Betrays a Man, and into Ruin throws,</hi></l>
<l><hi>When once it gains a Crown, it Vertue grows.</hi></l>

<l>'tis well, I do deserve this from thee,</l>
<l>For being such an Ass to fight for one</l>
<l>Who melts each Hour away in Luxury,</l>
<l>And gives his Kingdom for a Widow's Toy.</l>
<l><hi>Edward,</hi> my Wrongs are great, and thou shalt find</l>

<l>Did I forget, that by the House of <hi>York</hi></l>

<l>What Answer made King <hi>Lewis</hi> to our Letters?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mess.</speaker>
<l>At my Depart these were his very Words;</l>
<l>Go tell false <hi>Edward,</hi> thy supposed King,</l>
<l>That <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> is sending over Maskers,</l>
<l>To revel it with him, and his new Bride.</l>

<l>I'll wear the Willow Garland for his sake.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>I blame not her, she cou'd say little less;</l>
<l>Her's was the Wrong. But what said <hi>Henry</hi>'s Queen?</l>

<l>He, more incens'd against your Majesty</l>

<l>Sir, all our Lives wholly depend on yours,</l>
<l>And for one Fault of your dead Grandfather,</l>
<l>Which he repented, will you punish Thousands?</l>
<l>That he full sore repented <hi>Richard</hi>'s Death,</l>
<l>His Deeds do show, for in goodly Order</l>
<l>He follow'd the King's Body to the Grave,</l>
<l>And on it he bestow'd more contrite Tears,</l>
<l>Than from it issued forced Drops of Blood.</l>
<l>Five Hundred Poor he yearly held in pay,</l>
<l>Who twice a Day their wither'd Hands held up</l>
<l>Towards Heav'n, to pardon the sad bloody Crime.</l>
<l>And more, did he not erect two Chauntries,</l>
<l>Where still the sad and solemn Priests do sing</l>
<l>For <hi>Richard</hi>'s Soul: You'll sin to lose the Crown,</l>
<l>More than our Grandfather did to gain it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>If you will doom your self to be depos'd,</l>
<l>Because the Crown was gotten by ill Means;</l>
<l>By the same Law you may destroy half your Kingdom,</l>
<l>If Men, by inheriting their Fathers Fortunes,</l>
<l>Inherit the Crimes, by which their Fathers gain'd 'em,</l>

<l>That Things ill got had ever bad Success.</l>
<l>I'll leave my Son my virtuous Deeds behind,</l>
<l>And would my Father had left me no more:</l>
<l>For all the rest is held at such a Rate,</l>

<l>Thou being a King, blest with a goodly Son,</l>

<l>Which sometimes they have us'd with fearful Flight,</l>

<l>Promise no less than glorious Victory.</l>
<l>Their Arms all shining bright appear a Sun;</l>
<l><pb n="52" facs="55"/>
Their piercing Eyes, that sparkle thro' their Helmets,</l>
<l>With a quick Motion spread a Fire around 'em,</l>
<l>And show like Stars twinkling i'th' Firmament.</l>
<l>The Plumes and Colours waving o'er their Heads,</l>
<l>Do fan the Fire that has possess'd their Hearts.</l>
<l>Each prancing Horse neighs Courage to his Rider,</l>
<l>And with their horned Hoofs they paw the Ground,</l>
<l>As they'd dig Graves for all our Enemies.</l>

<l>By Heav'n, I think I cou'd perswade my Father</l>

<l>I leave behind my Soul's dearest Treasure</l>

<l>That if the Almighty Power's gracious Will</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. E.</speaker>
<l>Is not our Father <hi>Warwick</hi> gone to fight</l>

<l>Had not my noble Father first commanded.</l>
<l>I plainly saw, when he did leave King <hi>Edward,</hi></l>
<l>It was his Love for me did prompt him on.</l>
<l>Why have I not the Power to keep him here?</l>
<l>Oh, now he has got Possession of my Person,</l>

<l>To suffer more, it may avail a little</l>
<l>To stop the Torrent of my flowing Tears,</l>
<l>But I am sure that is impossible.</l>
<l>Whene'er I strive to press a rising Sigh,</l>

<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>Oh <hi>Ned,</hi> sweet <hi>Ned,</hi> speak to thy Mother, Boy:</l>
<l>Canst thou not speak?—O Traytors! Murderers!</l>
<l>They that stabb'd <hi>Caesar,</hi> shed no Blood at all;</l>
<l>Did not offend, nor were not worthy Blame.</l>
<l>If this foul Deed were by, to equal it:</l>
<l>He was a Man, this in respect a Child,</l>
<l>And Men ne'er spend their Fury on a Child.</l>
<l>What's worse than Murderer, that I may name it?</l>
<l>No, no, my Heart will burst, and if I speak,</l>
<l><pb n="59" facs="64"/>
And I will speak, that so my Heart may burst.</l>
<l>Oh cruel Villains! bloody Cannibals!</l>
<l>How sweet a Plant have you untimely cropp'd?</l>
<l>You have no Children, Butchers, if you had,</l>
<l>The Thought of them wou'd have stir'd up Remorse;</l>
<l>But if you ever chance to have a Child,</l>
<l>Look in his Youth to have him so cut off.</l>
<l>As Death's Men you have rid this sweet young Prince.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Away with her. Go, bear her hence by force.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,</l>
<l>Here sheath thy Sword, I'll pardon thee my Death.</l>
<l>What, wilt thou not? then, <hi>Clarence,</hi> do it thou.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<l>By Heav'n I will not give thee so much Ease.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>Good <hi>Clarence</hi> do, sweet <hi>Clarence</hi> do thou do it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<l>Didst thou not hear me swear I wou'd not do it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>Ay, but thou usest to forswear thy self.</l>
<l>'Twas Sin before, but now 'tis Charity.</l>
<l>What, wilt thou not; where is that Butcher <hi>Richard?</hi></l>
<l>He is not here, or he wou'd grant my Suit,</l>
<l>And set me free from hated Light at once.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Away, I say, I charge you bear her hence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>So come to you and yours as to this Prince.</l>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Where's <hi>Richard</hi> gone.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<l>To <hi>London</hi> in great haste, and, as I guess,</l>
<l>To make a bloody Supper in the <hi>Tower.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>He's sudden if a Thing comes in his Head.</l>
<l>Now march we hence—discharge the common sort</l>
<l>With Pay and Thanks, and let's away to <hi>London,</hi></l>
<l>And see how well our gentle Queen does fare:</l>
<l>By this I hope she hath a Son for me.</l>
<l>Now here's a Period of tumultuous Broils.</l>
<l>Once more we fit on <hi>England's</hi> Royal Throne,</l>
<l>Re-purchas'd with the Blood of Enemies.</l>
<l>What valiant Foe-Men, like to Autumn's Corn,</l>
<l>Have we mow'd down in top of all her Pride.</l>
<l>Three Dukes of <hi>Somerset,</hi> threefold renown'd</l>
<l>For hardy and undoubted Champions.</l>
<l>Two <hi>Cliffords,</hi> as the Father and the Son.</l>
<l>And two <hi>Northumberlands;</hi> two braver Men,</l>
<l>Ne'er spur'd their Coursers at the Trumpet's Sound.</l>
<l>With them the two brave Bears, <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Mountague,</hi></l>
<l>That in their Chains fetter'd the kingly Lion,</l>
<l>And made the Forest tremble when they roar'd.</l>
<l><pb n="60" facs="65"/>
Thus have we swept Suspicion from our Seat,</l>
<l>And made our Footstool of Security.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<l>What will your Grace have done with <hi>Margaret?</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<l>Away with her, and waft her hence to <hi>France.</hi></l>
<l>And then what rests, but that we spend the Time</l>
<l>With stately Triumphs, mirthful Comick Shews,</l>
<l>Such as befit the Pleasure of the Court,</l>
<l>So to divert our Subjects busy Minds,</l>
<l>From doing farther Mischief 'gainst the State.</l>
<lg>
<l><hi>Sound Drums and Trumpets, farewel all Annoy,</hi></l>
<l><hi>For here, I hope, begins our lasting Joy.</hi></l>
<l><hi>And may this Land, learn from our Houses Jars,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Ever to dread th' Event of Civil Wars.</hi></l>
