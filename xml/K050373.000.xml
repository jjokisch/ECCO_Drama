<head>DEDICATION. TO JOHN STRUTT, ESQ. MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR MALDON.</head>
<opener><salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>MY admiration of your unfeigned patriotism, was not excited, but confirmed by that singular, and manly instance, which made you revered by all, who could feel for the tarnished glory of their country!—To that public virtue in the individual I esteem, this Play is disinterestedly inscribed.—</p>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>TO prepare MASSINGER'S Tragi-Comedy, THE PICTURE, for a modern entertainment, proved a more arduous task than was at first conceived. After giving a different turn to the drama, by making the changes of the Picture, the effects of <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s jealousy, instead of the magic art of <hi>Baptista,</hi> and expunging the gross indelicacies which overran the play, it was found that most of the characters required a little fresh modelling to complete the design of the present undertaking. Hence the necessity of new-writing no inconsiderable part of the dialogue, in imitation of the old Dramatist. Though enamoured with the beauties of the antique structure, the Alterer set about its reparation with the utmost dissidence, fearing, like an unskilful architect, he might destroy those venerable features he could not improve! What has been his success, the public decision must determine.</p>
<p>The same kind of irregular and broken measure, through necessity still prevails, except where the language could be reduced to the heroic verse without impairing the spirit of the dialogue.</p>
<p><pb facs="5"/>
As to the <hi>unities,</hi>—being so totally disregarded by MASSINGER himself, no use could possibly be made of them in the present alteration.</p>
<p>The performance of the MAGIC PICTURE was every thing that an Author could expect, or wish for. The friendship and liberality of Mr. HARRIS were zealously exerted on the occasion. Mr. SHIELD aided it with his harmonic powers; and every performer, by a well sustained character, united in it's support: but Miss YOUNGE'S SOPHIA was too striking a representation not to demand a particular acknowledgment.—To this fortunate combination of talents, THE MAGIC PICTURE chiefly stands indebted for the very flattering reception with which it has been honored!</p>

<byline>WRITTEN BY W. PEARCE, ESQ.</byline>
<stage>[A Bell tolls.]</stage>
<lg>
<l>REGARDLESS of yon bell, which strikes mine ear,</l>
<l>I, troubled shade of <hi>Massinger,</hi> appear!— <stage>[Ghost rises.</stage></l>
<l>What frenzy cou'd impel the daring thought,</l>
<l>To seize the PIECE my lab'ring fancy wrought?</l>
<l>The PICTURE glowing with selected <hi>dies?</hi>—</l>
<l>O 'tis a deed to make a <hi>Spirit</hi> rise!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But why shou'd I meet favor from an age,</l>
<l>That martyrs even <hi>Shakespear</hi> in its rage?</l>
<l>How late had princely <hi>Hamlet</hi> cause to rave!—</l>
<l>Depriv'd of clowns to dig <hi>Ophelia's</hi> grave!</l>
<l>Where was the <hi>skull,</hi> whose fate remembrance wept?</l>
<l>And where the turf, on which poor <hi>Yorick</hi> slept?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>By temp'rance sooth'd, each murmur here shall end:</l>
<l>'Tis dang'rous with a <hi>Gownsman</hi> to contend;—</l>
<l>One, charter'd over spirits giv'n to riot,</l>
<l>Whose pow'r can lay me in the <hi>Red-sea</hi> quiet!</l>
<l>For now I'm quite bereft of Magic arms;</l>
<l>And what could <hi>Merlin</hi> do without his charms!</l>
<l>The Sorc'rers art is lost—And yet this age</l>
<l>Exceeds the <hi>feats</hi> of Royal James's <note n="*" place="foot">Demonologia, a treatise written by James the First.</note> page!</l>
<l><hi>He</hi> wrote of wizzards visiting the moon;—</l>
<l>But what are <hi>broomsticks</hi> to an <hi>air balloon!</hi></l>
<l>Not all the scenes, describ'd by <hi>Tasso's</hi> verse,</l>
<l>Where Daemons met, their rituals to rehearse,</l>
<l>Could match the horrors of that crimson day,</l>
<l>When ELLIOT'S <hi>machinations</hi> were at play!</l>
<l>And the <hi>Enchanter,</hi> CURTIS, whirl'd amain,</l>
<l>By <hi>spells</hi> of fire, the batteries of Spain!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="7"/>
<l>But soft!—The brazen voice of War is mute;</l>
<l>And sounds of Peace are heard in each salute!</l>
<l>View <hi>me,</hi> then, as an herald of her way;</l>
<l>And in this wreath, the <hi>olive</hi> crown survey!</l>
<l>Bend with obedience to her soft'ning strains;</l>
<l>Nor arm against poor <hi>Massinger's</hi> remains!</l>

<l>Imitation! 'tis but a scurvy business at the best,</l>

<l>Since we must part, my love, farther to pass</l>
<l>Is not alone unwise, but even dangerous;</l>
<l>For on yon frontier height, the Turkish camp</l>
<l>Extends 'twixt us and the Hungarian line:</l>
<l>Be now discreet as ever, and pr'ythee wed</l>
<l>Thy understanding to thy constant patience!</l>

<l>Wash'd with our blended tears.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>If blest the hour that ratified our union,</l>
<l>How can Eugenius leave me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="10"/>
<speaker>EUGENIUS.</speaker>
<l>Not as some think, for mere desire of fame,</l>
<l>Or to be cry'd up by the public voice</l>
<l>For a brave soldier, do I appear in arms:</l>
<l>Such airy humours strike not me: Alas!</l>
<l>Too well thou know'st, with what a scanty hand</l>
<l>Fortune has dealt out our demeans; 'tis she</l>
<l>Enjoins it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>In you alone, my lord,</l>
<l>I've all abundance!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIUS.</speaker>
<l>In your own language I would answer you,</l>
<l>For thou hast been a right obedient wife:</l>
<l>And to my power (tho' short of your desert)</l>
<l>I hope I have not fail'd in th' indulgent husband.</l>
<l>We have long enjoy'd the sweets of love;</l>
<l>Yet, my Sophia,</l>
<l>We must not live such dotards in our pleasures,</l>
<l>As still to hug them to a certain loss.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>Have you in me</l>
<l>Found any sign of discontent, my lord?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>No my Sophia,</l>
<l>Nor shalt thou e'er have reason to repent</l>
<l>Thy constant course in goodness, if heav'n smile</l>
<l>Upon my honest undertakings. 'Tis for thee</l>
<l>That I turn soldier, and cheerfully embark</l>
<l>Upon this sea of action, there to trade</l>
<l>For rich materials; nobly to adorn</l>
<l>Thy lovely person; and to th' admiring world</l>
<l>Display it in full lustre. Oft I've blush'd</l>
<l>That other ladies, inferior ev'n in beauty</l>
<l>And outward form, but in the harmony</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="11"/>
Of the soul's ravishing music not to be nam'd</l>
<l>With thee, in splendour should outshine thee,</l>
<l>While you, devoid of these, past unregarded.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>If I'm so rich in your opinion, why for me</l>
<l>Would you additions borrow?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIUS.</speaker>
<l>Why? Should I not be justly censured</l>
<l>Of ignorance, possessing such a jewel</l>
<l>Above all price, if I forbore to give it</l>
<l>The best of ornaments? Therefore, Sophia,</l>
<l>In few words, know my pleasure, and as briefly</l>
<l>As you have ever done, obey me; to your discretion</l>
<l>I leave the government of my family,</l>
<l>And our poor fortunes: to the uttermost</l>
<l>Of what is mine, live plentifully,</l>
<l>And ere the remnant of our store be spent,</l>
<l>I hope, with my good sword, to reap for you</l>
<l>A harvest, that shall make a merry winter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>Since you are not</l>
<l>To be by me diverted from your purpose,</l>
<l>Go when you please, my poor impatient soul</l>
<l>Must follow after you. To tell you,</l>
<l>What in your absence I will do, would shew</l>
<l>But poorly; my actions best will speak it.—</l>
<l>It were to doubt your love, should I request</l>
<l>That I might hear from you; but by night or day,</l>
<l>No courier, unexamin'd, shall pass by.—</l>
<l>Adieu! <stage>[throwing herself in his arms.</stage></l>
<l>If thus within your arms I dwell too long,</l>
<l>Think of the cruel fast that must succeed</l>
<l>This short dear feast, and you'll excuse it.</l>

<l>O Baptista!</l>
<l>'Tis not in me to master so my passions.</l>
<l>I must know farther, or you have made good</l>
<l>But half your promise. While my Love stood by</l>
<l>Holding her's upright—how, thus untempted,</l>
<l>Could she give proof of well-tried constancy?</l>
<l>But when I'm absent, and my coming back</l>
<l>Uncertain—she, without controul or curb,</l>
<l>The absolute disposer of herself—nay, more,</l>
<l>By strong temptations press'd on ev'ry side—</l>
<l>If then she holds out—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>As no doubt she will:</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIUS.</speaker>
<l>These doubts must be made certainties</l>
<l>By your assurance, or your boasted Art</l>
<l>Will lose its admiration.</l>

<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>I cannot dive into her hidden thoughts,</l>
<l>And learn her close intents, with all my skill;</l>
<l>But what I can, I readily will do.—</l>
<l>Will it content you, if, while distant far,</l>
<l>You there shall know, as if you then were with her,</l>
<l>When, and how far, by Love, she e'er be wrought on?</l>

<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>I'll instruct you:</l>
<l>Carry it still about you, and as oft</l>
<l>As you have wish to know how she's affected,</l>
<l>With curious eye peruse it: while it holds</l>
<l>The beauteous image that it now presents</l>
<l>Entire and perfect, know that she remains</l>
<l>Not only innocent, but unattempted.</l>
<l>But if th' harmonious colouring should change,</l>
<l>And, from its softly blended white and red,</l>
<l>Incline to jealous yellow, rest assur'd</l>
<l>She is with ardor woo'd, tho' yet unconquer'd.</l>
<l>Should it assume a fatal sable hue,</l>

<l>Give me our court warfare; eh! Ricardo?</l>
<l>The danger's not so great in the encounter</l>
<l>Of a mistress—the conflict there costs no limbs—</l>
<l>Thou, by thy own report, Ricardo,</l>
<l>Wast a wag when young, and since that time</l>
<l>Hast studied every rank, from the night trader</l>
<l>I' th' street, with certain danger to thy pocket,</l>

<l>To tell thee plainly, being, as you see,</l>
<l>The likelier man, and of much more experience,</l>
<l>There's no beauty</l>
<l>But yields ere it be summon'd; and as nature</l>

<l>No, no, Ricardo; I never yet did aim</l>

<l>I would venture this neck to a halter,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RICARDO.</speaker>
<l>Have you but mark'd with what reserve she looks</l>
<l>When the King himself makes his approach to her,</l>
<l>As she were still a virgin, and his life</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>Yes, and how she oft has swoon'd when she has heard</l>

<l>Well, where 'twill end I know not, for the King</l>
<l>Is so indulgent to her humours, that ev'n now,</l>
<l>When both his crown and life are at the stake,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>EUBULUS.</speaker>
<l>I like the issue of this stubborn battle:</l>
<l>Are the officers gone as by the King directed,</l>
<l>To receive the gallant General?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RICARDO.</speaker>
<l>Long since, and ere this have greeted him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUBULUS.</speaker>
<l>You know your office, Lords, on his arrival?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>UBALDO.</speaker>
<l>Who, we? oh! fear not us, my Lord, I pray,</l>
<l>We know our distance and degrees.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RICARDO.</speaker>
<l>The state were miserable truly, if</l>
<l>The court had none of her own breed familiar</l>
<l>With all the gaits of form and punctilio,</l>
<l>To receive its visitors.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>UBALDO.</speaker>
<l>'Tis a great pity</l>
<l>That such as sit at the helm, provide no better</l>
<l>For the training up of the gentry:—in my judgment</l>
<l>An academy erected, with large pensions</l>
<l>To such as miraculously speak</l>
<l>I'th' congees, cringes, postures, and the phrase</l>
<l>Proper to every nation.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RICARDO.</speaker>
<l>O, it were</l>
<l>An admirable piece of work.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="25" facs="32"/>
<speaker>UBALDO.</speaker>
<l>And yet rich fools</l>
<l>Throw away their charity on hospitals</l>
<l>For beggars and lame soldiers, and ne'er study</l>
<l>The due regard to compliment, and court breeding.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUBULUS.</speaker>
<l>Our court needs no aid this way, since it is</l>
<l>A school of nothing else. There are some of you</l>
<l>Whom I forbear to name, whose coining heads</l>
<l>Are the mint of all new fashions, that have done</l>
<l>More hurt to the kingdom by superflous foppery,</l>
<l>Which the foolish gentry imitate, than a war</l>
<l>Or a long famine; all the treasure by</l>
<l>This foul excess, is got into the hands of</l>
<l>Silk-men, tailors, and embroiderers!</l>
<l>Nay, the third part of the land too, our nobles</l>
<l>Engrossing titles only!</l>
</sp>

<l>This courtesy</l>
<l>To the General, my Honoria, keeps fair rank</l>
<l>With all your virtues!</l>
<l>After your warfare, <stage>[To Ferdinand.</stage></l>
<l>Look on our court delights; but first from your</l>
<l>Relation, with delighted ears, I'll hear</l>
<l>The music of your war, which must be sweet,</l>
<l>Ending in victory.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND.</speaker>
<l>Not to trouble</l>
<l>Your Majesties with the description of a battle,</l>
<l>Too full of horror for the place, I'll be as brief as possible.</l>
<l>It was well fought on both sides, and almost</l>
<l>With equal fortune; it continuing doubtful</l>
<l>Upon whose tents plum'd victory would take</l>
<l>Her glorious stand. Impatient of delay,</l>
<l>With the flower of our prime gentlemen, I charg'd</l>
<l>Their main battalia, and with their assistance</l>
<l><pb n="30" facs="37"/>
Broke in; but when I was almost assur'd</l>
<l>They were routed, by a stratagem</l>
<l>Of the subtle Turk,</l>
<l>Rallying up his troops on either side,</l>
<l>I found myself so far engag'd (for I</l>
<l>Must not conceal my faults) that I knew not</l>
<l>Which way, with honor, to retreat.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUBULUS.</speaker>
<l>I like</l>
<l>A general that tells his faults, and is not</l>
<l>Ambitious to engross unto himself</l>
<l>All honor, as some have; in which, with justice,</l>
<l>They could not claim a share.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND.</speaker>
<l>Being thus hemm'd in,</l>
<l>Their scymetars rag'd amongst us; and my horse</l>
<l>Kill'd under me, I every minute look'd for</l>
<l>An honorable end, and that was all</l>
<l>My hope could fashion to me. Circled thus</l>
<l>With death and horror, as one sent from heav'n,</l>
<l>This man of men, with some choice horse that follow'd <stage>[To Eugenius.</stage></l>
<l>His brave example, did pursue the track</l>
<l>His sword cut for them; and (but that I see him</l>
<l>Already blush to hear what, he being present,</l>
<l>I know would wish unspoken) I should say, Sir,</l>
<l>By what he did, we boldly may believe</l>
<l>All that is writ of ancient heroes!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIUS.</speaker>
<l>General,</l>
<l>Pray spare the feelings of an humble soldier.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUBUIUS.</speaker>
<l>Do not blush</l>
<l>To hear a truth, here are a pair of Monsieurs, <stage>[To Ubaldo and Ricardo.</stage></l>

<speaker>FERDINAND.</speaker>
<l>He, as I said, like dreadful light'ning thrown</l>
<l>From Jove's broad shield, dispers'd the armed host</l>
<l>With which I was environ'd. Horse and man</l>
<l>Shrunk under his strong arm: more with his looks</l>
<l>Frighted, the valiant fled; with which encourag'd,</l>
<l>My soldiers, like young eagles, preying under</l>
<l>The wings of their fierce dam, bravely came on.</l>
<l>By him I was remounted, inspir'd</l>
<l>With treble courage, and such as fled before</l>
<l>Boldly made head again; and to confirm 'em,</l>
<l>It suddenly was apparent that the fortune</l>
<l>Of the day was ours. Each soldier and commander</l>
<l>Perform'd his part; but this was the great wheel</l>
<l>By which the lesser mov'd, and all rewards</l>
<l>And signs of honor to him alone belong.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADISLAUS.</speaker>
<l>And they shall</l>

<l>From the magnificence of the King, I will</l>
<l>Dispense his bounty too, but as a page</l>

<l>The remnant of my life in deeds of arms,</l>
<l>No region is more fertile of good Knights,</l>
<l>From whom my knowledge that way may be better'd,</l>

<l>The only wonder of the age, and shall I,</l>
<l>Now give way to a competitor?</l>
<l>I thought one amorous glance of mine could bring</l>
<l>All hearts to my subjection—but this stranger</l>
<l>Unmov'd as rock contemns me!</l>
<l>I must know more of this fair prodigy;</l>
<l>And for that purpose quickly will dispatch</l>
<l>Ubaldo and Ricardo, courtiers both</l>
<l>Well train'd in all the windings of our sex—.</l>
<l>But him, although bright honor deck his brow</l>
<l>I view not with a wanton eye—my pride</l>
<l>Howe'er demands a tributary sigh</l>
<l>'Tis all I ask; so that ere morning's dawn</l>
<l>By well feign'd female blandishments I'll prove</l>
<l>Whether I cannot warm his heart to love!</l>

<l>THIN, thin provision!—I am dieted</l>
<l>Like one set to watch hawks; and to keep me waking,</l>

<l>—Here stand I centinel, and though I fright</l>
<l>Beggars from my lady's gate, in hopes to have</l>
<l>A larger share—I find my commons mend not!</l>
<l>—I look'd this morning into my glass—the river,</l>
<l>And there appear'd a fish call'd "a poor John,"</l>
<l>Cut with a lenten face after my own likeness;</l>
<l>And he seem'd to say, "Good morrow, cousin!"</l>
<l>—No man comes this way but has a sting at me.</l>
<l>A chirurgeon passing by, asked at what rate</l>
<l>I would sell myself?—for what use? quoth I?</l>
<l>To make, said he, a live anatomy,</l>
<l>As thou art transparent without dissection!</l>
<l>—They say, that famine dwells i'th' camp, tho' till</l>
<l>My lord returns, or certain tidings of him</l>
<l>She will stick close by me;—but sorrow's dry</l>
<l>And I must drink! <stage>[Draws water with an earthen pitcher, and drinks.</stage></l>

<l>Whether they sleep or not;—in some such measure</l>
<l>Incredulous of what I see, and touch,</l>
<l>As 'twere a fading apparition, I</l>
<l>Am still perplex'd and troubled; and when most</l>
<l>Confirm'd 'tis true, a curious jealousy</l>
<l>To be assur'd, by what means, and from whom,</l>
<l>Such a mass of wealth was first deserv'd, then gotten,</l>

<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>To spare, Sir, that trouble,</l>
<l>I'll take your word, which, in a gentleman,</l>

<l>In such grace with the Queen?</l>
</sp>

<l>One? a hundred!</l>

<l>Upon your silence, it being for your profit.—</l>
<l>Such a soldier, and such a courtier never came</l>

<l>Nay, there is such a contention among them</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> UBALDO.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>UBALDO.</speaker>
<l>Pretty one, there's gold <stage>[To Corisca.</stage></l>
<l>To buy thee a new gown; and there's for thee, <stage>[To Hillario.</stage></l>
<l>Grow fat and fit for service—Now am I</l>
<l>At fortune's top most round, and able to</l>
<l>Beget a giant! <stage>(Aside.)</stage> O my better angel,</l>
<l>You now will shew your wisdom, when you pay</l>
<l>Your husband in his own coin; shall you sit</l>
<l>Like a patient Grizzle, to be laugh'd at? No,</l>
<l>This is a fair revenge, so quickly let's retire.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>But fair and softly sweet, my Lord; for thus</l>
<l>Shall I neglect your friend, to whom, by promise,</l>
<l>I'm equally engag'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>UBALDO.</speaker>
<l>I must confess,</l>
<l>The more the merrier; but of all men living</l>
<l>Take heed of him! You may safer run upon</l>
<l>The mouth of a cannon when it's unloading!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>I protest I do not understand you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>UBALDO.</speaker>
<l>I'll then expound it for your good; he is</l>
<l>Nought but a scurvy fish at best; the tub's</l>
<l>His weekly bath; he hath not drank for years</l>
<l>But sasafras and guiacum; and dry mutton's</l>
<l>His daily portion!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>Your caution I'll reward.</l>

<l>—But when?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>Why, presently; follow my woman,</l>
<l>She knows where to conduct you, and will serve</l>
<l>You for a page to-night.—Be it your care</l>
<l>To minister at his toilet, and that with speed; <stage>[To Corisca.</stage></l>
<l>Delay takes from delight; a nectar posset</l>
<l>See be quickly brought into his chamber!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>UBALDO.</speaker>
<l>Excellent Lady!—and a caudle too</l>
<l>I'th' morning, if so it please you.</l>

<speaker>HILLARIO.</speaker>
<l>Would this good company but often come,</l>

<l>Will prove a gainful purchase.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>For your sake,</l>
<l>I've put him off; he only begg'd a kiss,</l>
<l>And so we parted.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RICARDO.</speaker>
<l>He did not touch your lip?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>Why sure there was no danger in the touch?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RICARDO.</speaker>
<l>No? Quickly eat these scented lozenges,</l>
<l>Of forty crowns an ounce, or you're undone?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>Wherefore? what can be th' virtue of 'em?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RICARDO.</speaker>
<l>I am compell'd to use 'em in abundance,</l>
<l>E'en when I talk with him, or else be poisoned:</l>
<l>But I'll be free with you—he was once a creature,</l>
<l>It may be of Heaven's making, but long since</l>
<l>He is turn'd to a druggist's shop: the Spring and Fall</l>
<l>Hold all the year with him: that he <hi>lives,</hi> he owes</l>
<l>To Art, not Nature; she has giv'n him o'er;</l>
<l>He moves like the fairy king, on screws and wheels</l>
<l>Made by his doctor's recipe, and yet still</l>
<l>They're out of joint, and each day want repairing:—</l>
<l>In a frosty morning,</l>
<l>You may thrust him in a pottle pot; his bones</l>
<l>Rattle in his skin like beans toss'd in a bladder;</l>
<l>If he but hear a coach, fumigation cannot save him</l>
<l><pb n="68" facs="75"/>
From the chin evil. In a word, he is</l>
<l>Not one disease, but all; but being my friend,</l>
<l>I would forbear his character, as I would not</l>
<l>Wrong him in your good opinion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>The virtues you bestow on him, to me</l>
<l>Are mysteries I know not—however,</l>
<l>Since my partiality for you in vain</l>
<l>I would conceal—this sigh declares me your's.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RICARDO.</speaker>
<l>Poor—blind <hi>Ubaldo!</hi> He must take the maid.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>See that you robe him in the sattin vest,</l>
<l>And lay the perfum'd night-cap on his pillow.</l>
</sp>

<l>This cloak, this sword, and doublet, all are thine,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>CORISCA.</speaker>
<l>Hunger and hard labour</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HILLARIO.</speaker>
<l>I do remember that they stopp'd their noses</l>
<l>At the fight of beef and mutton, as coarse feeding</l>
<l>For their fine palates; but now, their work being ended,</l>
<l>They leap at a barley crust, and hold cheese-parings,</l>

<speaker>CORISCA.</speaker>
<l>When I examine</l>
<l>My spinster's work, he trembles like a 'prentice,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>RICARDO.</speaker>
<l>And Queen too!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADISLAUS.</speaker>
<l>I remember</l>
<l>This face, when it was in a better plight:</l>
<l>Are not you Ricardo?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="92" facs="99"/>
<speaker>RICARDO.</speaker>
<l>I was once so, please</l>
<l>Your Grace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HONORIA.</speaker>
<l>And this thing, I take it</l>
<l>Was once Ubaldo!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>UBALDO.</speaker>
<l>I am now I know not what.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RICARDO.</speaker>
<l>We thank your Majesty for employing us</l>
<l>To this subtle Circe!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>You see, Madam,</l>
<l>How I have cur'd your servants; and what favors</l>
<l>They with their gallantry have won from me!</l>
<l>You may, as they are physic'd, I presume,</l>
<l>Now safely trust them; they have learnt, besides,</l>
<l>Their several trades to live by, and paid nothing</l>
<l>But cold and hunger for them, and may now</l>
<l>Set up for themselves; for here I give them over.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>UBALDO.</speaker>
<l>Then hang all trades!</l>
<l>I'll find a new one; that is, to live honest.</l>
<stage>[Exeunt Ubaldo and Ricardo.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HILLARIO.</speaker>
<l>I am sorry for this general gaol delivery;</l>
<l>These are my fees, however, so I'm content.</l>
<stage>[Exit, strutting in his fine cloaths.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>As for you, Sir!— <stage>[To Eugenius.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIUS.</speaker>
<l>Which way shall I intreat you?</l>
<l>I am not worthy of it; my Sophia!</l>
<l>My best Sophia! here, before the King,</l>
<l>The Queen, these Lords, and all surrounding us,</l>
<l><pb n="93" facs="100"/>
I do renounce my error, and embrace you</l>
<l>As the great example to all after times,</l>
<l>With reverence to imitate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>Not so, Sir!</l>
<l>I still hold off, although I here have clear'd</l>
<l>My doubtful innocence.</l>
<l>When you went to the wars,</l>
<l>I set no spy upon you, to observe</l>
<l>Which way you wander'd, though our sex, by nature,</l>
<l>Is subject to suspicions; for I fix'd</l>
<l>My confidence on your try'd loyalty:</l>
<l>But to deal as you did, 'gainst your reason,</l>
<l>With magic nonsense to survey my actions,</l>
<l>Was more than woman's weakness: therefore know,</l>
<l>And 'tis my boon unto the King, I do</l>
<l>Desire a separation from your bed;</l>
<l>For I will spend the remnant of my life</l>
<l>In pray'r, and meditation!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIUS.</speaker>
<l>O take pity</l>
<l>Upon my weak condition, or I am</l>
<l>More wretched in your innocence, than if</l>
<l>I had found you guilty. Have you shewn a jewel</l>
<l>Out of the cabinet of your rich mind</l>
<l>To lock it up again?—She turns away—</l>
<l>Will none speak for me? Shame hath robb'd me</l>
<l>Of the use of utterance!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADISLAUS.</speaker>
<l>Since you have conquer'd, Madam,</l>
<l>You wrong the glory of your victory,</l>
<l>If you use it not with mercy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>EUBULUS.</speaker>
<l>Have I liv'd to see</l>
<l>But one good woman, and shall we for a trifle</l>
<l>Have <hi>her</hi> turn nun! I'll first pull down the cloysters!</l>
<l>—'Tis not enough, sweet Dame, that you are good,</l>
<l>We must have some o' th' breed!</l>
<l>Shew me but two such more,</l>
<l>I'll love myself, and, may be—marry!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HONORIA.</speaker>
<l>She that yet</l>
<l>Ne'er knew what 'twas to bend but to the King,</l>
<l>Thus begs remission for him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>O dear Madam,</l>
<l>Wrong not your greatness so.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<l>We are all suitors!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>I perceive</l>
<l>There's no resisting your entreaties,—since</l>
<l>My own fond heart demands his restoration!</l>
<l>But should I pardon what's already past,</l>
<l>Who can secure me that he will be free</l>
<l>From hideous Jealousy hereafter?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIUS.</speaker>
<l>I</l>
<l>Will be mine own security!—Go ride,—</l>
<l>Feast,—revel,—banquet,—and with whom you please.</l>
<l>I'll set no watch upon you; and from hence,</l>
<l>(Blushing to think how passion has misled me)</l>
<l>This cheating semblance of thy beauteous self</l>
<l>I throw away,</l>
<l>And only bow to nature, and to thee!</l>

<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>If from her sov'reignty you ne'er had swerv'd,</l>
<l>No stratagem of mine had been devis'd</l>
<l>To practice aught on your credulity.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIUS.</speaker>
<l>Blind as I was—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BAPTISTA.</speaker>
<l>But since it lur'd you from that fatal gulph</l>
<l>To which suspicion blindly leads her train,</l>
<l>I do applaud me for the deed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<l>And I</l>
<l>My plaudits join; for now my mind's at ease,</l>
<l>And every soft idea bids him welcome!</l>
<l>Within, great Prince, our humble board is spread,</l>
<l>And waits the honor'd sanction of your presence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADISLAUS.</speaker>
<l>We will attend you:—Your hand, fair hostess,</l>
<l>Unless it feed the good man's jealousy!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIUS.</speaker>
<l>Oh, no, my liege!—his tyrant reign's dissolv'd.</l>
<l>For now our mutual confidence shall prove,</l>
<l>The guardian-knot, to bind our future LOVE!</l>
