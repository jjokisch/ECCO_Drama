<head>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE The Earl of CHESTERFIELD.</head>
<opener><salute>My Lord,</salute></opener>
<p>I Did not dare, so coldly was this Play received by the Town, to ask Leave, in the usual Forms, to dedicate it to your Lordship. Its Fate was early determined, and in such a Manner, that I very little flatter myself, it can be worthy of your Lordship's Patronage, or may presume to boast it was once honoured with your Approbation. But as I may, probably, never have another Opportunity, certainly not in this Kind of writing, of publicly professing my Respect, my Esteem, I had almost said, my Affection for your Lordship, may I not be forgiven, if I thus dedicate, not the Play, but its Author; not his Poetry, but his Understanding and his Heart?</p>
<p>WITH Sentiments such as these, I dare assure your Lordship, you shall not be insulted with the usual, too civil, Language of Dedications. Yet I confess, I would gladly recover the Name of Dedications to its antient Dignity, before they were prostituted, most absurdly prostituted, by the Author of the <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> when he dedicated to a Tyrant a Poem in Defence of Liberty. I
<pb facs="4"/>
confess, I mean to praise; for honest Praise is not only one of the warmest Incitements to Virtue, but its most honourable Reward. Great Minds will receive it with their natural Greatness, and only little Spirits have an Affectation of refusing it. The Task, I own, is not without Difficulty, but when the Original is marked with strong and pleasing Lines of Life, a meaner Hand may preserve the Likeness. The Integrity of his Colouring, if I may be allowed the Expression, is of more Consequence, than the Glow and Richness of it. Dedications would then be like Pictures in Miniature, which the future Historian might draw out into larger Proportion, Grace, and Dignity.</p>
<p>LET me then have the Honour of informing your Lordship's Historian, that although your Youth perhaps was spent, among Pleasures, not ill-suited to that gayer Season of Life (neque tu choreas sperne, puer) yet it was not lost among its too frequent Dissipations. Ancient and modern Languages, with an accurate and critical Knowledge of the English Tongue, its Harmony, Copiousness, and Variety of Expression, are not to be acquired without much Application. Nor could the greatest natural
<pb facs="5"/>
Abilities, not even your own, my Lord, have appeared in the most important Debates of the House of Lords, with such superior Strength of Reasoning, with Eloquence (in the true Character of Eloquence) at once pleasing and powerful, had they not been improved by all Advantages of Education.</p>
<p>TO such Abilities were intrusted the Honour and Interest of the Nation in Embassies abroad, and the most important Employments at Home. How happily for IRELAND was the Possessor of them sent thither as Lord Lieutenant in that dangerous Crisis, the late Rebellion? One Part of the Nation, the natural Enemies of his Majesty's Government, were to be awed by Power, tempered with Lenity; the other were to be restrained in their Zeal of Loyalty, which though sometimes shewn, perhaps, with too much Warmth, hath ever been their Glory and their Boast. How happily the Goodness of your Lordship's Heart was mixed with the Wisdom of your Councils, the Gratitude of the whole People will for ever acknowledge. Long may you enjoy their Wishes, their Prayers for your Happiness. Long may you enjoy the Consciousness of your own Integrity, that nobly
<pb facs="6"/>
refused a Vote of Credit, and an Offer of raising a Body of Forces, which you wisely foresaw would be an useless Expence to the Kingdom. What must be the Firmness, and Generosity of that Spirit, which is not to be seduced by Gold, intimidated by Danger, or corrupted by Views of enlarging its Power!</p>
<p>YOUR Lordship now seems determined (and surely the gallant Veteran deserves his Dismission) to retire from all public Business. Permit, my Lord, this honest Dedication, for well you know that Flattery would not desire it, to attend you to your Retreat, and with it be pleased to accept the sincerest Respect of</p>

<head>THE PROLOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>O'ER a soft Tale of well imagin'd Woes</l>
<l>The willing Tear with feeble Transport flows;</l>
<l>But when the Muse in her own Griefs appears,</l>
<l>The storied Sorrows of a thousand Years;</l>
<l>A nobler Tribute, than our Tears we pay,</l>
<l>Our Passions hear her, and our Hearts obey.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Such Scenes to-night—Oh! for a Muse of Fire,</l>
<l>Great <hi>Shakespear,</hi> thine, our Author to inspire;</l>
<l>Then fierce Ambition, Guilt, Despair, and Rage,</l>
<l>And frantic Jealousy should shake the Stage;</l>
<l>Tyrants and Slaves her equal Wrath should find,</l>
<l>Her Furies haunt them, and revenge Mankind.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But where's the modern Spirit can sustain</l>
<l>The Weight of Greece, or draw the Roman Scene?</l>
<l>Their Heroes seem of some superior State,</l>
<l>Great in their Virtues, in their Vices great;</l>
<l>Here wild Ambition Earth and Heaven defies,</l>
<l>And there—Oh! glorious Fate! the Patriot greatly dies.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet if, with modest Hope, our Author aim</l>
<l>At your Applause—for your Applause is Fame,</l>
<l>Let him, to-night, your wonted Candour find,</l>
<l>Oh! be the Critic's Eye a little blind;</l>
<l>And if to You, ye Fair, he pours his Heart,</l>
<l>To your Distresses gives his tenderest Art,</l>
<l>To Beauty, Virtue, and to You he sues,</l>
<l>As you inspir'd—Oh! patronize his Muse.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by Miss BELLAMY.</stage>
<lg>
<l>WELL! you expect—so says the Taste in Vogue—</l>
<l>To these sad Scenes a laughing Epilogue!</l>
<l>But I'm untaught in every comic Grace,</l>
<l>Wit's bolder Mirth, or Humour's various Face;</l>
<l>Nor shall I dare, with your lov'd, mimic, Art,</l>
<l>Take off the Cit—the Beau—the Blood—the Smart.</l>
<l>Shall I the dear Coquet's sweet Trifling try?</l>
<l>Pish—as I live—be quiet—let me die—</l>
<l>Then, melt a Look—deliciously explaining</l>
<l>The double—no, good Faith! the single Meaning.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>As for our Play—methinks, this tragic Plot</l>
<l>Might furnish precious Hints, for you know what—</l>
<l>To leave an Empress—tho' so wondrous chaste—</l>
<l>With a young Lover—two full Hours at least—</l>
<l>In our frail Times, this dangerous tete a tete—</l>
<l>In the first Act—had made the Play complete.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And then the Moral—ye, whose happy Lives</l>
<l>Are bless'd with rare Discretion—in your Wives;</l>
<l>When Trifles—light as Air—shall turn your Heads,</l>
<l>Ah! shun that naughty Trick—of separate Beds,</l>
<l>Besides the midnight—reconciling Billing,</l>
<l>Ah! think, how near was <hi>CONSTANTINE</hi> to killing.</l>
<l>But hush our Bard—</l>
<l>If should he hear us laughing, wont he say,</l>
<l>Your flippant Mirth,—good Ma'am—may damn my Play.</l>
<l>Then for my Sake—but I'm in such a Fright—</l>
<l>Well—I'll give out the Play—for Monday Night.</l>

<stage>Miss BELLAMY's Illness prevented her speaking it.</stage>
<lg>
<l>IN all this Scene of Treason, Swords and Death</l>
<l>My Fright has almost ta'en away my Breath;</l>
<l>And yet our Bard insists, that I must say</l>
<l>Something for him, and something for his Play.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Most of the Fair-ones sure must be contented,</l>
<l>And must approve the Part I've represented,</l>
<l>Who think these Characters no Stain to Life,</l>
<l>The duteous Daughter, and the tender Wife,</l>
<l>Who taste the highest Blessings, while they prove</l>
<l>The Husband's Fondness, and the Parent's Love.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Tho' I confess, there are of our sweet Sex,</l>
<l>Who, form'd to please, transform themselves to vex;</l>
<l>Rebels to gentlest Sway, Foes to Restriction,</l>
<l>Whose chiefest Bliss is plac'd in Contradiction;</l>
<l>Who think Obedience to the milder Will</l>
<l>Of a kind Parent, smells of Childhood still.</l>
<l>And that the Father should not be obey'd—</l>
<l>Not half an Hour—after the Portion's paid.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>To such alone, whose virtuous Bosoms prove</l>
<l>Paternal Fondness, or connubial Love</l>
<l>Our Author freely offers up his Cause,</l>
<l>And let those generous Passions stand for Laws;</l>
<l>By them he will be try'd; if they acquit,</l>
<l>He's safe; if they condemn, he must submit.</l>

<l>SPEAK; have I Leave to see her?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Yes; my Lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AURELIAN.</speaker>
<l>But when? How soon? For did the Hour, Marcellus,</l>
<l>Ride on the Tempest's Wing, the Speed of Light,</l>
<l>Its Swiftness were too slow. Yet, yet she comes not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>What can these Transports mean? Are these Emotions</l>
<l>To tell the Empress, that her Lord returns</l>
<l>With Conquest to her Arms? Did Friendship send you</l>
<l>Its Messenger of Love? Did CONSTANTINE—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AURELIAN.</speaker>
<l>He sent me not.</l>

<pb n="2" facs="12"/>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>My Lord!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AURELIAN.</speaker>
<l>Nor do I come</l>
<l>A Messenger of Conquest, Joy, or Love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Then my worst Fears are true. Th' impetuous Passion</l>
<l>Flames forth again; again MAXIMIAN's Daughter—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AURELIAN.</speaker>
<l>Is she not all her Sex's Pride would aim at,</l>
<l>Their various Arts of charming?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Dear my Lord,</l>
<l>Tho' she were fairer, than th' ideal Beauty,</l>
<l>That warms the Lover's Hopes, or Poet's Fancy,</l>
<l>Yet shall the bright Temptation, (best Excuse</l>
<l>For human Frailty) melt away all Faith,</l>
<l>Allegiance, Honour, Duty? Oh! remember—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AURELIAN.</speaker>
<l>What? That she now is wedded to another?</l>
<l>Another breathes my Transports o'er her Bosom,</l>
<l>Sighs out my Love, and drinks, with raptur'd Ear,</l>
<l>The Vows, that once were mine? If thou couldst charm</l>
<l>The Madman's Ravings; bid the Heart be still,</l>
<l>When Passion shakes us; or with Words of Wisdom</l>
<l>Pour on the feverish Sense the Balm of Health,</l>
<l>I then might listen to thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Is this AURELIAN!</l>
<l>The Pride of Rome! Th' Example of her Youth!</l>
<l>But I confess, this Language well befits</l>
<l>Your Commerce with MAXIMIAN; a Spirit made of Fire,</l>
<l>Whose fierce Ambition, and whose fell Revenge,</l>
<l>(He knows no other Passions) vex his Soul,</l>
<l>As adverse Winds, and meeting Tides at Sea</l>
<l>Roll the wild Waves on Heaps.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="13"/>
<speaker>AURELIAN.</speaker>
<l>Revenge! Ambition!</l>
<l>Whence can they rise? What Motives to enflame them?</l>
<l>Does he not share with our great Emperor</l>
<l>All but the Name of Empire, and its Cares?</l>
<l>What would a Father's Heart, howe'er ambitious,</l>
<l>More than to see the Homage of the Nations,</l>
<l>Paid to his Daughter's Virtues; to her Beauty?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Her Greatness only brings to his Remembrance</l>
<l>His own was lost, when our late Emperor</l>
<l>Forc'd him to give her Hand to CONSTANTINE,</l>
<l>And, happily for Europe, wrested from him</l>
<l>Th' imperial Power. Since when, his Rage beholds</l>
<l>His Son, as the Usurper of his Throne:</l>
<l>Then, in his Zeal for the old Gods of Rome,</l>
<l>He hates him as a Christian. Should he tempt</l>
<l>Your Youth to join with his Despair, your Virtue,</l>
<l>I know the rich Reward.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AURELIAN.</speaker>
<l>Look, where she comes.</l>
<l>A rich Reward indeed. I pray you leave me,</l>

<l>Why would you thus alarm me? I'm a Woman</l>

<l>When the Rage</l>

<l>Perhaps, with some Impatience,</l>

<l>The Consciousness of Greatness, and the Pride,</l>

<l>The Pride, the Joy—You are the Wife of CONSTANTINE.</l>
<l>Yet oh! remember, there was once a Time,</l>
<l>When other Loves approach'd you; when MAXIMIAN</l>

<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>What other Power can make him</l>

<l>All other Passions have their Hours of Thinking,</l>

<l>Here, CONSTANTINE,</l>
<l>Thy guardian Genius cries aloud, beware:</l>
<l>No farther tempt your Fate; inquire no more:</l>

<l>Starting! confus'd! The stern MAXIMIAN tremble!</l>
<l>While from the fiery Fierceness of his Eye</l>
<l>A Look of wild Compassion at the Empress</l>
<l>Shot forth its Softness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Tho' MAXIMIAN's Manners</l>
<l>Are of the sterner Kind, he has an Heart—</l>
<l>No Father softer. To behold his Daughter</l>
<l>In such unwonted Agonies of Sorrow—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Oh! she is all her Sex's Tenderness!</l>
<l>I've known her weep to hear a well-feign'd Tale</l>
<l>Of one, who fell from Honour. If AURELIAN—</l>
<l>If he's a Traytor, are they not most lovely,</l>
<l>These pious Sorrows of Esteem and Friendship?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Friendship, Esteem, I thought were manly Virtues,</l>
<l>Too firm for Woman's wayward, wandering Spirit.</l>
<l>But if the Empress, Sir.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>The Empress, Sir!</l>
<l>Why is she nam'd? Why these licentious Hints</l>
<l>Against her Sex? Say, wherefore is her Name</l>
<l>Insulted with their Weakness, with their Frailties?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Insulted, Sir! Long may you think her virtuous;</l>
<l>Long may she live untainted, unsuspected.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="35" facs="45"/>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Untainted! Unsuspected! Think her virtuous!</l>
<l>Roman, take heed. Tho' I believe thee honest,</l>
<l>And love that Soldier's Plainness in thy Manners,</l>
<l>Yet dare not, for thy Life—By my just Rage,</l>
<l>Thy Life shall answer for a Thought, that wrongs her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Sir, I obey you gladly; for I know not</l>
<l>A greater Curse to any honest Heart,</l>
<l>Than to think ill of others.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Ill of whom?</l>
<l>Not of my Wife? my FULVIA? Is she not</l>
<l>A noble Proof, where Men may see, and wonder</l>
<l>At Woman's perfect Worth? Still, still thy Looks</l>
<l>Are darken'd o'er with some mysterious Mischief!</l>
<l>You are a Christian; Truth is your Religion;</l>
<l>You are a Soldier; Honour's your Profession:</l>
<l>You were my Father's Friend; he lov'd, esteem'd you:</l>
<l>By his great Name, by every sacred Power,</l>
<l>(If aught be sacred now) Allegiance, Honour,</l>
<l>Let me conjure thee, tell me thy worst Meanings.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>It was my Sense of Honour and Allegiance,</l>
<l>That prompted me thus far. Were I a Courtier,</l>
<l>I might have learn'd (not thus abrupt and bold)</l>
<l>With silken Language to have cloth'd my Purpose.</l>
<l>But, Sir, I am a Soldier, rough, and simple,</l>
<l>And now in plain, blunt Honesty must tell you—</l>
<l>Yet if the distant Fear can shake you thus,</l>
<l>Will not the glaring Certainty of Shame—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="36" facs="46"/>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>What uninvented, unimagin'd Tortures</l>
<l>Have I to dread? My Heart is on the Rack▪</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Would I could give it Ease. Alas! my Lord,</l>
<l>You saw MAXIMIAN; saw the Agitation,</l>
<l>That shook his Frame. It was the Father's Fondness</l>
<l>Labouring to disbelieve against Conviction.</l>
<l>But such the Proofs—sure they were strong indeed,</l>
<l>If he condemn'd; if he could think her guilty.</l>
<l>And yet a moment's Pause. There is a Circumstance,</l>
<l>That throws its Light—its Light of Hope around us.</l>
<l>Did she this Morning, Sir, the Empress ask you</l>
<l>To make AURELIAN Captain of your Guards?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>She did.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Your Wife! your Empress, Sir? your FULVIA!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>What means this passion'd Repetition? She;</l>
<l>FULVIA; my Wife.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>To place him near your Person!</l>
<l>Sure, not with much Intreaties?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Yes; most earnest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Then Hell's Intelligence is true.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Now, tell me,</l>
<l>Why did you ask?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>What did I ask, my Lord?</l>
<l>In this Confusion Memory no longer</l>
<l>Holds its firm Seat.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="37" facs="47"/>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>I'll tell you then. You ask'd me,</l>
<l>Whether my Wife with strong Intreaties press'd me</l>
<l>To make AURELIAN Captain of my Guards.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Oh! my dear Lord forget it, lest th' Idea</l>
<l>Murder your sweetest Slumbers, and unfix</l>
<l>The seated Throne of Reason; for they swore,</l>
<l>(When sure the Soul speaks Truth) in Death's last Pangs,</l>
<l>When wide Eternity was opening on them—</l>
<l>They swore your Wife had promis'd, even with Tears,</l>
<l>With every Art, and Subtlety of Woman,</l>
<l>To make the bold Request.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Why? wherefore bold?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>I cannot—must not tell you—Sir, they swore,</l>
<l>That his Attendance on your sacred Person</l>
<l>Might with more Ease; more frequent Opportunity—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Ha! dare not for thy Soul. One added Thought</l>
<l>Carries such Ruin, such Perdition with it—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>And yet what Harm, my Lord? Their frequent Meetings,</l>
<l>No Doubt, were pious ones: to give Success</l>
<l>To our new Faith, and propagate its Doctrines.</l>
<l>Such as this Morn—but that, perhaps, was Zeal;</l>
<l>'Twas Friendship's Warmth; to tell of your Return.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>What of this Morning? Where? What frequent Meetings?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="38" facs="48"/>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Here in the Palace, two full Hours, at least,</l>
<l>The Empress was in private with AURELIAN.</l>
<l>Jocund he seem'd, as one, who gain'd some Point</l>
<l>Of highest Moment. Doubtless, then he urg'd</l>
<l>Th' unwary Princess to this bold Request;</l>
<l>And such his Form; such Shews of manly Virtue—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>His Form! Why that deceive her? But this Morning—</l>
<l>See her in private, two long Hours, and more!</l>
<l>Leave his Command; leave that officious Zeal,</l>
<l>With which he ever waited on our Person?</l>
<l>Leave them? for what? For a religious Council?</l>
<l>For holy, pious Meetings?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Dear my Lord—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>She was most just; most faithful to her Promise.</l>
<l>With more than Woman's Arts; with Tears, Distraction;</l>
<l>With frenzy'd Terrors, with the Shrieks of Murder;</l>
<l>With fancy'd Visions—All ye Powers of Hell,</l>
<l>Where could she learn? Where was she practis'd thus?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>In Truth, 'tis somewhat strange. Yet still, my Lord,</l>
<l>Appearances, most probable, are oft</l>
<l>Most false. Truth is of simpler Kind.</l>
<l>And unperplex'd with Circumstance. AURELIAN</l>
<l>Has every Shew of Worth; is brave and wise,</l>
<l>And tho' he lov'd the Empress, 'twas before,</l>
<l>That Marriage made her yours.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Oh! well remember'd.</l>
<l>Yes; we were Rivals once, and sure his Passion</l>
<l><pb n="39" facs="49"/>Flam'd high as mine; impetuous even to Madness.</l>
<l>He lov'd to Madness—for he lov'd like me.</l>
<l>Fool that I was; dull Fool. I thought his Friendship</l>
<l>Conquer'd his Love; but, oh! that Thought how vain</l>
<l>My own Heart proves. Amidst these wildest Transports</l>
<l>My Reason hates; my Glory sickens at her,</l>
<l>Yet still my Soul's in Love. With lavish Tongue</l>
<l>She dwelt upon his Praise—"The Soldier's Pride;</l>
<l>" The rising Hope of Rome"—O blushless Wanton!</l>
<l>Thy Tears, thy Terrours now want no explaining,</l>
<l>Nor those strong Cries for Mercy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Most amazing!</l>
<l>Is't possible! These Transports for a Woman?</l>
<l>A false one too! To see you thus afflicted</l>
<l>O'ercomes thy Soldier's Firmness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>What Affliction?</l>
<l>Thou see'st it not. 'Tis in my Heart? my Head;</l>
<l>'Tis in my Brain. Thro' every beating Pulse</l>
<l>It drinks my vital Blood. Thro' every Sense</l>
<l>It pours the gushing Sorrow fast upon me.</l>

<l>Distraction in his Look, and wildest Rage—</l>
<l>Even when he weeps, for still he weeps her Name,</l>
<l>His softest Transport's Madness. Then he swears,</l>
<l>As with a Moment's Interval of Reason,</l>
<l>'Tis all a Lie, and with a Lover's Rapture</l>
<l>Talks o'er her Form, her Beauties, and her Virtue.</l>

<l>These Intervals of Reason may be dangerous.</l>

<l>Rather, like Lightnings flashing o'er a Storm,</l>

<l>Prevents all farther Witness. Every Look,</l>

<l>When late the Sword of War, with swift Descent,</l>
<l>Was falling on your Life, did not AURELIAN</l>
<l>Oppose his Bosom to the Stroke? Is this,</l>

<l>Your Eye grows wilder, and in broken Pantings</l>
<l>Your quick Breath heaves. Should you see aught more dreadful,</l>
<l>Will not Imagination catch its Horrors,</l>
<l>Strike the weak Sense, and fright it into Madness?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>No; my CORNELIA, no. I'll not run mad.</l>
<l>What tho' my Brain's on Fire; my glowing Eyes</l>
<l>Just starting from their Orbs, and every Sense</l>
<l><pb n="61" facs="71"/>Confus'd and wild, yet why should I run mad?</l>
<l>'Tis not to tear this Hair; to shriek with Pain,</l>
<l>To rend these Eye-balls from their bleeding Rings,</l>
<l>And dash them rayless to their native Earth,</l>
<l>That can express my Griefs. Why, then, run mad?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CORNELIA.</speaker>
<l>Ye pitying Powers—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>You talk'd of pathless Terrors.</l>
<l>Is not Despair my Guide, and see, CORNELIA,</l>
<l>Faithful it points to yonder open Door.</l>
<l>There Treason enter'd; there the Man of Blood—</l>
<l>And there I'll enter too.</l>
<l>Blood! Blood! CORNELIA. See the gory Steps,</l>
<l>Where Murder stalk'd along. Now, now, ye Powers</l>
<l>In Mercy, Justice, Anger, Pity, strike</l>
<l>This Head devoted; lest in desperate Frenzy,</l>
<l>I should give Way to Horror, and perform</l>
<l>The ever damning Deed of Self-Destruction.</l>

<stage><hi>to</hi> ALBINUS.</stage>

<l>If you are privy to his Death, Oh! tell me.</l>
<l>Give me his mangled Corse, deform'd with Wounds,</l>
<l>Besmear'd with Blood, and Death's own Paleness on it,</l>
<l>I'll o'er it play a Scene of such wild Sorrows—</l>
<l><pb n="62" facs="72"/>Such Frenzy, such Distraction, as shall charm you</l>
<l>To shed a human Tear, and think of Pity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBINUS.</speaker>
<l>Of that I question. But my present Hours</l>
<l>Have other Cares. This Night your Lord, your Emperor</l>
<l>Began to be immortal. Ere he went</l>
<l>To take his Throne among his kindred Gods,</l>
<l>(We shall to-morrow deify his Virtues)</l>
<l>He left a Present for his much-lov'd FULVIA;</l>
<l>That noble Choice of Death.</l>

<stage>Enter a Soldier with a Dagger and a Bowl of Poison.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>Oh! truly welcome,</l>
<l>Thou Freedom of the Soul, at whose great Bidding</l>
<l>Th' immortal Spirit wings its gladsome Way,</l>
<l>Throws off its Earth, and sports without its Weight</l>
<l>In yonder Fields of Light. There mine, perhaps,</l>
<l>May meet my Lord, cloth'd with ethereal Brightness;</l>
<l>How the World shrinks, with all its vast Ambition,</l>
<l>Its little Greatness at a Thought like this.</l>
<stage>[Taking the Bowl.</stage>
<l>Now, thou immortal Spirit of my Lord,</l>
<l>In whatsoever Orb of Light enthron'd,</l>
<l>Look down upon me, your suspected FULVIA.</l>
<l>This to our second Nuptial Day in Heaven.</l>

<stage>[<hi>Guards seize</hi> ALBINUS.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Is it then given me, ye all-gracious Powers,</l>
<l>Once more to gaze upon thy Beauty's Wonders!</l>
<l>While Love—for, oh! the Rage of Jealousy,</l>
<l><pb n="63" facs="73"/>Even Madness self was Love—now cover'd o'er</l>
<l>With Blushes, with Confusion, kneels before thee.</l>
<stage>[He kneels.</stage>

<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>Restor'd to Life! Can Miracles do this?</l>
<stage>[CONSTANTINE <hi>rises.</hi></stage>
<l>'Tis he; 'tis he! My living Lord, my Emperor!</l>
<l>For, oh, my Heart, I feel thy wonted Transports,</l>
<l>Which he alone, the Lord of Love, inspires.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Oh! excellent in Goodness! My AURELIAN,</l>
<l>Behold, and wonder at the bright Perfection.</l>
<stage>[<hi>To</hi> FULVIA.</stage>
<l>He too forgives, O generous Proof of Friendship,</l>
<l>The Outrage to his Virtue. See MARCELLUS,</l>
<l>And know my Safety thence. ALBINUS thought him</l>
<l>Firm to their Cause, and sent him to the Legions,</l>
<l>To gain their Strength. He thence returned at Night;</l>
<l>Came by the secret Way to my Apartment,</l>
<l>And told to my astonish'd Ears such Horrors—</l>
<l>Then begg'd, in Proof of his Fidelity,</l>
<l>To lay a Slave, who was this Morn condemn'd,</l>
<l>In th' Imperial Bed. MAXIMIAN's Rage</l>
<l>Declares the rest.</l>

<l>Oh! Hear these speechless Sorrows; hear and pity me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="64" facs="74"/>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>With all the fearful Tenderness of Love;</l>
<l>With Eyes, that flow in Pity; with a Tongue,</l>
<l>That faulters to pronounce it—can I speak it?</l>
<l>The Justice of the World demands his Fate.</l>
<stage>[As commanding him to go.</stage>
<l>MARCELLUS, tho' I know th' ungrateful Office—</l>

<speaker>FULVIA</speaker>
<stage>kneeling.</stage>
<l>Oh! for his Sake, th' eternal Power of Mercy,</l>
<l>Who when thy great Heart's quell'd by Age or Sickness,</l>
<l>Shall hear thy Weakness, hear thy Cries of Pain,</l>
<l>Give me my Father's Life. This Day has join'd</l>
<l>My Fame to his Misfortunes. Should he perish,</l>
<l>Oh! will it not be said, that I betray'd him?</l>
<l>And, can you, Sir, behold me; can you make me</l>
<l>A Name of horrid Parricide for ever?</l>
<l>To all succeeding Times? Unnumber'd Ages</l>
<l>Shall curse your FULVIA's Memory.</l>
<stage>[<hi>To</hi> MARCELLUS.</stage>
<l>Stay; oh! stay.</l>
<l>I see soft Pity drop the saving Tear—</l>
<stage>[<hi>To</hi> MARCELLUS.</stage>
<l>A little Moment more—and CONSTANTINE</l>
<l>Becomes a God of Mercy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Is there a Strength in Man, that can resist</l>
<l>The Power of Beauty, when it pleads its Tears.</l>
<l>Go, my AURELIAN, and relieve his Terrors;</l>
<l>Sooth his Despair, his disappointed Rage:</l>
<l>Assure him of his Life, nor Life alone,</l>
<l>But grac'd with Honors, worthy of our Friendship.</l>

<l>And thou, O Love, in all thy golden Records,</l>

<l>Well then; the Gods have otherwise decreed;</l>
<l>And be it so. MAXIMIAN shall appear,</l>
<l>(I thank thee, Jove; the Trial's worthy of me)</l>
<l>In his own Strength; superior to his Fortune,</l>
<l>And CAESAR's haughty Clemency.</l>
<stage>[<hi>To</hi> AURELIAN.</stage>
<l>—Lead on.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>My Father—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAXIMIAN.</speaker>
<l>How that Name comes o'er my Heart!</l>
<l>She kneels and weeps! Art thou so wondrous good?</l>
<l>Can'st thou forgive me, FULVIA; call me Father,</l>
<l>And give me back thy Love? Did not my Rage</l>
<l>Accuse thy Innocence, and blast thy Fame?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>It was Ambition's Rage; no more remember'd.</l>
<l>But even Ambition shall be satisfied.</l>
<l>Greatness and Power, for CONSTANTINE hath spoke it,</l>
<l>Duty and Love, shall wait upon your Age,</l>
<l>'Till Time, with lenient Hand, shall lay it down</l>
<l><pb n="66" facs="76"/>In honourable Death; 'till Fame shall crown</l>
<l>Your Life, and that last Hour with equal Glory.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAXIMIAN.</speaker>
<l>If Life could pass away in the Delight</l>
<l>Of fondly gazing on thee; could th' Idea</l>
<l>Of that full Sway, which aw'd the western World,</l>
<l>Be ever from my Memory; could I forget</l>
<l>I was an Emperor once, dispensing Fame,</l>
<l>Greatness and Honors round me, then, perhaps,</l>
<l>I might forget, I liv'd to be forgiven,</l>
<l>And bow'd me to the Power, that gave me Life,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>It shall not need—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAXIMIAN.</speaker>
<l>Indeed, my Lord, it shall not.</l>
<l>MAXIMIAN better shall consult his Glory.</l>
<l>Your Father, Sir, depos'd me; not by War,</l>
<l>By the fair Fortune of th' embattled Field,</l>
<l>But by his better Arts, and skill in Treaties,</l>
<l>Arts, which I boasted not; but yet it joy'd</l>
<l>My gloomy Soul, to think I should repay them</l>
<l>With equal Vengeance. Thence my haughty Spirit</l>
<l>Stoop'd to the Baseness of a midnight Murder.</l>
<l>You now would give me Life—to crown that Gift</l>
<l>An honourable Share of Power and Greatness.</l>
<l>Now mark a Generosity above thee;</l>
<l>Take from this Hand th' unrival'd Throne of Power,</l>
<l>The undivided Empire of the World,</l>

<l>For my last Groan gives you the Universe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONSTANTINE.</speaker>
<l>Oh! FULVIA—but I'll not insult thy Sorrows,</l>
<l>By talking Comfort to them. Yet remember,</l>
<l><pb n="67" facs="77"/>Why we are placed thus high; not to exempt us</l>
<l>From human Woes, but that the World may learn</l>
<l>A nobler Fortitude by our Example.</l>
<l>To wake the Soul to Virtue, and impart</l>
<l>A warmer Spirit to the languid Heart,</l>
<l>The Passions were design'd; but here behold</l>
<stage>[Looking back to the Scenes.</stage>
<l>Wild when they Rage, by reason uncontroul'd,</l>
<l>Less rapid is the Storm's destructive Sway,</l>
<l>While Guilt, Remorse, Despair, and Ruin mark their Way.</l>
