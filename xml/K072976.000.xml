Himself in the Cause
of Liberty, to which the Corruption
I have here endeavoured

<p>The Freedom of the Stage
is, perhaps, as well worth contending

work quicker and stronger on
the Minds of Men than Precepts.</p>
<p>This will, I believe, my
LORD, be found truer with
<pb facs="4"/>

The most ridiculous
Exhibitions of Luxury or Avarice
may likely have little Effect
on the Sensualist or the
Miser; but I fansy a lively Representation

Corruption, might have a
very sensible and useful Effect
on the Spectators.</p>
<p><hi>Socrates,</hi> who owed his
Destruction greatly to the

the Comedies of <hi>Aristophanes,</hi>
is a lasting Instance of the
Force of Theatrical Ridicule:
Here, indeed, this Weapon
was used to an ill Purpose;
<pb facs="5"/>
but surely, what is able to
bring Wisdom and Virtue into
Disrepute, will with great
Facility lay their Opposites
under a general Contempt.
There are among us who
seem so sensible of the Danger
of Wit and Humour, that
they are resolved to have nothing
to do with them: And
indeed they are in the right
on't; for Wit, like Hunger,
will be with great Difficulty restrained
from falling on, where
there is great Plenty and Variety
of Food.</p>

Sons of Dulness shed all their

have seen, that to be celebrated
by them, and applauded
by the more discerning and
worthy, are the only Rewards
which true Patriotism (a Word
scandalously ridicul'd by some)
can securely expect. And
here I am pleading the Cause
of others; for the only Title

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>THIS Comedy was begun at <hi>Leyden</hi>
in the Year 1728, and after
it had been sketched out into a few loose
Scenes, was thrown by, and for a long
while no more thought of. It was originally
writ for my private Amusement;
as it would indeed have been little less
than Quixotism itself to hope any other
Fruits from attempting Characters wherein
the inimitable <hi>Cervantes</hi> so far excelled.
The Impossibility of going beyond, and the
extreme Difficulty of keeping pace with him,
were sufficient to infuse Despair into a very
adventurous Author.</p>
<p>I soon discovered too, that my too small
Experience in, and little Knowledge of the
World, had led me into an Error. I soon
found it infinitely more difficult than I
imagined, to vary the Scene, and give my
<pb facs="9"/>
Knight an Opportunity of displaying himself
in a different manner from that wherein he
appears in the Romance. Human Nature
is every where the same. And the Modes
and Habits of particular Nations do not
change it enough, sufficiently to distinguish
a <hi>Quixore</hi> in <hi>England</hi> from a <hi>Quixote</hi> in
<hi>Spain.</hi></p>
<p>In these Sentiments Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> concurred with me, who, upon
seeing the aforesaid Sketch, both dissuaded
me from suffering it to be represented on
the Stage; and accordingly it was remanded
back to my Shelf, where, probably, it
would have perished in Oblivion, had not
the Solicitations of the distrest Actors in
<hi>Drury-Lane</hi> prevail'd on me to revise it,
at the same time that it came into my
Head to add those Scenes concerning our
Elections.</p>
<p>Being thus altered, it was often rehearsed
on that Theatre, and a particular Day
appointed for its Action; but the Giant
<hi>Cajanus,</hi> of a Race who were always
<pb facs="10"/>
Enemies to our poor <hi>Don,</hi> deferred his Appearance
so long, that the Intervention of
the Actor's Benefits would have put it off
till the next Season, had I not brought it on
where now it appears.</p>
<p>I have troubled the Reader thus long, to
account for this Comedy's appearing as it
now does, and that he might distinguish
those Parts of it which were the Production
of this Season from those which were
written in my more juvenile Years, and before
most of the Pieces with which I have
endeavoured to entertain the Publick.</p>

<head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
<stage>MANAGER, AUTHOR.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MANAGER.</speaker>
<p>NO Prologue, Sir! The Audience will never bear
it. They will not bate you any thing of their
due.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Auth.</speaker>
<p>I am the Audience's very humble Servant;
but they cannot make a Man write a Prologue, whether
he can or no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, there is nothing easier: I have
known an Author bring three or four to the House
with one Play, and give us our Choice which we
would speak.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Auth.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir; and I have now three in my Pocket,
written by Friends, of which I choose none should
be spoke.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>How so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Auth.</speaker>
<p>Because they have been all spoke already twenty
times over.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Let me see them, pray.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Auth.</speaker>
<p>They are written in such damn'd cramp Hands,
you will never be able to read them; but I will tell
you the Substance of them. One of them begins with
abusing the Writings of all my Cotemporaries, lamenting
the fallen State of the Stage; and lastly, assuring
the Audience that this Play was written with a
Design to restore true Taste, and their approving it
is the best Symptom they can give of their having
any.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb facs="14"/>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Well, and a very good Scheme.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Auth.</speaker>
<p>May be so; but it hath been the Subject of
almost every Prologue for these ten Years last past.
The Second is in a different Cast: The first twelve
Lines inveigh against all Indecency on the Stage, and
the last twenty Lines shew you what it is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>That would do better for an Epilogue: But
what is the Third?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Auth.</speaker>
<p>Why, the Third has some Wit in it, and
would have done very well, but for a Mistake.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Ay! What Mistake?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Auth.</speaker>
<p>Why, the Author never read my Play, and
taking it for a regular Comedy of Five Acts, hath fallen
very severely on Farce: However, it is a pretty
good one, and will do very well for the first genteel
Comedy you bring on the Stage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>But don't you think a Play, with so odd a
Title as yours, requires to be a little explain'd? May
they not be too much surpris'd at some things?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Auth.</speaker>
<p>Not at all. The Audience, I believe, are all
acquainted with the Character of <hi>Don Quixote</hi> and
<hi>Sancho.</hi> I have brought them over into <hi>England,</hi> and
introduced them at an Inn in the Country, where, I
believe, no one will be surpris'd that the Knight finds
several People as mad as himself. This I could have
told them in forty dull Lines, if I would, but I rather
chose to let it alone; for, to tell you the Truth, I can
draw but one Conclusion from the Prologues I have
ever seen, that the Authors are so sensible of the Demerits
of their Plays, that they desire to set the Audience
asleep before they begin: But of what real Use
is a Bill of Fare to any Entertainment, where the
Guests are not left to their Choice what Part they will
pick at, but are oblig'd to swallow the Whole indifferently?</p>
</sp>
<pb facs="15"/>
<stage>Enter a Player.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Play.</speaker>
<p>Sir, the Audience make such a Noise with
their Canes, that, if we don't begin immediately, they
will beat the House down before the Play begins; and
it is not advisable to put them out of Humour, for
there are two or three of the loudest Cat-calls, in the
Gallery, that ever were heard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Auth.</speaker>
<p>Be not frightned at that. Those are only
some particular Friends of mine, who are to put on
the Face of Enemies at first, and be converted at the
End of the First Act.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Order then to play away the Overture immediately.
Come, Sir, what do you do with yourself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Auth.</speaker>
<p>I shall dispose my self in some Part of the
House, where I shall see, and not be seen: And I can
assure you, Sir, if the Audience are but half as well
entertain'd with this Play, as I shall be my self, it will
go off with universal Applause.</p>

and eats me out on't, and then tells me he's a
Knight-Errant; he is an arrant Rogue, and if
he does not pay me my Bill, I'll have a Warrant
for him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>My Master fears no Warrant, Friend; had you ever
been in <hi>Spain,</hi> you would have known that Men of his Order
are above the Law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="17"/>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>Tell not me of <hi>Spain,</hi> Sir; I am an <hi>Englishman,</hi> where
no one is above the Law; and if your Master does not pay me,
I shall lay his <hi>Spaniardship</hi> fast in a Place, which he shall find it
as difficult to get out of, as your Countrymen have found it to
get into <hi>Gibraltar.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>That's neither here nor there, as the old Saying is; many
are shut into one Place, and out of another. Men bar Houses
to keep Rogues out, and Jails to keep them in. He that's
hang'd for stealing a Horse to-day, has no reason to buy Oats
for him to-morrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, your Horse, nor your Ass neither, shall have
any more Oats at my Expence; never were Masters and their
Beasts so like one another. The <hi>Don</hi> is just such another lean
Ramscallion as his—what d'ye call him—his <hi>Rozinante</hi>;
and thou art just such another squat Bag of Guts as thy <hi>Dapple.</hi>
Send my House and my Stable once well emptied of you, and
if ever I suffer a <hi>Spaniard</hi> to enter my Doors again, may I have
a whole Company of Soldiers quartered on me; for if I must
be eaten up, I had rather suffer by my own Country Rogues,
than foreign ones.</p>

<p>Ay, Sir, we are got into a terrible Country. A Man's
Quality here can't defend him, if he breaks the Laws.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Then indeed Knight-Errantry were of no Use: But I
tell thee, Caitif, Goals in all Countries are only Habitations for
the Poor, not for Men of Quality. If a poor Fellow robs a
Man of Fashion of Five Shillings, to Goal with him: But
the Man of Fashion may plunder a thousand Poor, and stay in
his own House. But know, thou base Squire of the great
Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> that an Adventure now presents it
self, not only worthy me, but the united Force of all the
Knights upon Earth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Ah, poor <hi>Sancho</hi>! there's an end of thee, a Leg or an
Arm will not suffice this Bout.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>There is now arrived in this Castle, one of the most
accursed Giants that ever infested the Earth. He marches at
the Head of his Army, that howl like <hi>Turks</hi> in an Engagement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Oh Lud! Oh Lud! this is the Country Squire at the

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>What dost thou mutter, Varlet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, this Giant that your Worship talks of, is a
Country Gentleman who is going a courting, and his Army
is neither more nor less than his Kennel of Fox-Hounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Oh, the prodigious Force of Inchantment! Sirrah, I
tell thee this is the Giant <hi>Toglogmoglogog,</hi> Lord of the Island of
<hi>Gogmogog,</hi> whose Belly hath been the Tomb of above a thousand
strong Men.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="20"/>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Of above a thousand Hogsheads of strong Beer, I believe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>This must be the Inchanter <hi>Merlin,</hi> I know him by
his Dogs; but, thou Idiot! dost thou imagine that Women are
to be hunted like Hares, that a Man would carry his Hounds
with him to visit his Mistress?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Sir, your true <hi>English</hi> Squire and his Hounds are as inseparable
as your <hi>Spanish</hi> and his <hi>Toledo.</hi> He eats with his
Hounds, drinks with his Hounds, and lies with his Hounds;
your true Errant <hi>English</hi> Squire is but the first Dog-Boy in his
House.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>'Tis pity then, that Fortune should contradict the Order
of Nature. It was a wise Institution of <hi>Plato</hi> to educate
Children according to their Minds, not to their Births; these
Squires should sow that Corn which they ride over. <hi>Sancho,</hi>
when I see a Gentleman in his own Coach-box, I regret the
Loss which some one has had of a Coachman; the Man who
toils all Day after a Partridge or a Pheasant, might serve his
Country by toiling after a Plough; and when I see a low,
mean, tricking Lord, I lament the Loss of an excellent Attorney.

<p>Most illustrious and most mighty Lord, how shall I
sufficiently pay you for those Sounds with which I have been
ravish'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I desire no other Payment but of this small Bill;
your Worship's Cattle are saddled, and it is a charming Day for
travelling.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Nothing, my Lord, shall ever tempt me to leave you,
till what I have this Day seen within the Castle-Walls be utterly
demolished.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>So! he has seen the Sirloin of Beef at the Fire, I find.

Necessity, I assure you.</p>

<p>My Lord, I am more confus'd than you; but do not
think it a Gift, since I see you so backward to receive it in that
Light. And since, my Lord, every thing I have, saving to the
charming <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> her fixt and unalterable Right,
be justly yours. Give me leave to call it a Debt, my Lord.

<p>If your Worship will please to tell me where I shall

<p>I am confounded, my Lord, at the Extravagance of

plunder'd, should not have reserv'd enough to oblige your Lordship
with such a Trifle; but, if you know any one who will
disemburse that Sum, or any other, I will sell him the Reversion

I fansy if I was to tell the Exciseman, and my Brewer, I was

<p>I wish your Worship would think of changing your
Quarters; if it must be a Balnketing, why let it be a Blanketing.
I have not eat any thing these twelve Hours; and I don't
find I am like to fare much better for the next twelve; and by
that time I shall be so light, you may as well toss a Feather in

<p>I suppose it is equal to your Worship what Court you
send me to; and, to say the Truth, I had rather go to some

she has got such a waundy Trick of being chanted, and I fansy

<p>My Master, the Knight of the Woful Figure (and a
woful Figure he makes, sure enough) sends your Ladyship his
humble Service, and hopes you will not take it amiss that he
has not been able to knock all the People in the House on the
Head; however, he has made it pretty well up in breaking
the Windows; your Ladyship will lie pure and cool, for the
Devil a whole Pane is there in all your Apartment; if the Glazier

<p>Thou mighty Squire of the most mighty Knight upon

this Adventure is reserv'd for some other Knight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Nay, nay, like enough; all Men cannot do all things;
one Man gets an Estate, by what another gets a Halter. All is
not Fish that swims. Many a Man wants a Wife, but more
want to get rid of one. Two Cuckolds see each other's Horns
when neither of them can see his own. Money is the Fruit of
Evil, as often as the Root of it. Charity seldom goes out of her
own House; and Ill-nature is always a rambling abroad. Every

one of your chanted Ladies: The Curate of our Parish, and
Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Barber, have often told me there was no such
Woman, and that my Master was a Madman; and sometimes
I am half at a loss to guess whether he be mad or no. I'm

mad neither; for he will talk sometimes, 'twould do one good
to hear him talk; he will talk ye three Hours, and I shan't understand
one Word he says. Our Curate was a Fool to e'en;
and yet he has talk'd what I could not understand neither, but
that's neither here nor there; an empty Purse causes a full
Heart; an old Woman's a very bad Bribe, but a very good
Wife; Conscience often stops at a Molehill, and leaps over a
Mountain; the Law guards us from all Evil but itself; what's
Vice to-day is Virtue to-morrow; 'tis not only Plumbs that
make a Pudding; Physick makes you first sick, and then well;
Wine first makes you well, and then sick.</p>

<p>No, no, Neighbour; then we shall not be sold, and
that's worse: But rather than it should come to that, I would
ride all over the Kingdom for a Candidate; and if I thought

no Vote of mine, I assure you. I shall vote for no Man who

<p>You are too cautious, Master <hi>Guzzle</hi>; I make no
doubt but he is some very rich Man, who pretends to be poor
in order to get his Election the cheaper; he can have no other
Design in staying among us. For my part, I make no doubt
but that he is come to stand on the Court Interest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, if he stands at all, it is on the Court Side,
no doubt; for he talks of nothing but Kings, and Princes, and
Princesses, and Emperors, and Empresses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>May.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, an Officer in the Army too, I warrant him,
if we knew but the bottom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="19" facs="34"/>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>He seems, indeed, to be damnably sond of Free-Quarter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ret.</speaker>
<p>But if you think he intends to offer himself, would it
not be wiser to let him; for then, you know, if he spends never
so much, we shall not be oblig'd to choose him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>May.</speaker>
<p>Brother Alderman, I have reproved you already for
that way of Reasoning; it savours too much of Bribery. I
like an Opposition, because otherwise a Man may be oblig'd to
vote against his Party; therefore when we invite a Gentleman
to stand, we invite him to spend his Money for the Honour of
his Party; and when both Parties have spent as much as they
are able, every honest Man will vote according to his Conscience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Mayor talks like a Man of Sense and Honour,
and it does me good to hear him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>May.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, Mr. <hi>Guzzle,</hi> I never gave a Vote contrary to
my Conscience. I have very earnestly recommended the Country-Interest
to all my Brethren: But before that, I recommended
the Town-Interest, that is, the Interest of this Corporation;
and first of all I recommended to every particular Man to take
a particular Care of himself. And it is with a certain way of
Reasoning, That he that serves me best, will serve the Town
best; and he that serves the Town best, will serve the Country
best.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>See what it is to have been at <hi>Oxford</hi>; the Parson in
the Parish himself can't out-talk him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>May.</speaker>
<p>Come, Landlord, we'll have one Bottle, and drink
Success to the Corporation: These Times come but seldom,
therefore we ought to make the best of them. Come along.</p>

<head>ACT II. SCENE I.</head>
<head>SCENE, <stage><hi>A Chamber in the Inn.</hi></stage></head>
<stage>Don Quixote, Sancho.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>THOU hast, by this time, fully perceiv'd, <hi>Sancho,</hi> the
extreme Difficulties and Dangers of Knight-Errantry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Ay, and of 'Squire-Errantry too, an't please your
Worship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>But Virtue is its own Reward.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Your Worship may have a Relish for these Rewards,
perhaps; but to speak truly, I am a poor plain Man, and know
nothing of these fine things; and for any Reward I have hitherto
got, I had much rather have gone without it. As for an
Island, I believe I could relish it as well as another; but a Man
may catch cold while his Coat is making: And since you may
provide for me in a much easier way, if I might be so bold as
to speak—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Thou knowest I will deny thee nothing, which is fit
for me to give, or thee to take.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Then if your Worship wou'd be so good as to set me
up in an Inn, I should make a rare Landlord; and it is a very
thriving Trade among the <hi>English.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>And couldst thou descend so low, ignoble Wretch?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Any thing to get an honest Livelihood, which is more
than I find we are like to do in the way we are going on: For,
if I durst speak it—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="21" facs="36"/>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Speak fearlesly.—I will only impute it to thy Ignorance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Why then I find, Sir, that we are look'd on here to be,
neither more nor less, better or worse, than a couple of Madmen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p><hi>Sancho,</hi> I am not concern'd at the evil Opinion of
Men. Indeed, if we consider who are their Favourites, we
shall have no reason to be so fond of their Applause. Virtue,
<hi>Sancho,</hi> is too bright for their Eyes, and they dare not behold
her. Hypocrisy is the Deity they worship. Is not the Lawyer
often call'd an honest Man, when for a sneaking Fee he pleads
the Villain's Cause, or attempts to extort Evidence to the Conviction
of the Innocent? Does not the Physician live well in
his Neighbourhood, while he suffers them to bribe his Ignorance
to their Destruction? But why should I mention those
whose Profession 'tis to prey on others? Look thro' the World,
What is it recommends Men, but the Poverty, the Vice, and
the Misery of others? This, <hi>Sancho,</hi> they are sensible of, and
therefore, instead of endeavouring to make himself better, each
Man endeavours to make his Neighbour worse. Each Man rises
to Admiration by treading on Mankind. Riches and Power
accrue to the One, by the Destruction of Thousands. These
are the general Objects of the good Opinion of Men: Nay,
and that which is profess'd to be paid to Virtue, is seldom more
to any thing than a supercilious Contempt of our Neighbour.
What is a good-natur'd Man? Why, one, who seeing the
Want of his Friend, cries he pities him. Is this real? No:
If it was, he would relieve him. His Pity is triumphant Arrogance
and Insult: It arises from his Pride, not from his
Compassion. <hi>Sancho,</hi> let them call me mad; I'm not mad enough
to court their Approbation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Oh! good your Worship, proceed: I could fast an
Hour longer to hear your Discourse.</p>

<sp>

<p>Give him Admittance. This is the chief Magistrate
of the Place, who comes, I suppose, to congratulate me on
my Arrival; he might have come sooner; but the Neglect of
his Duty is better than the total Omission. In the mean while,

<p>I am your Honour's most humble Servant.</p>

<p>Sir, I am glad to see you; I think you are the chief

<p>Yes, an't please your Honour, I am Mr. Mayor of

</sp>
<sp>

<p>Be seated, Sir; you are a worthy Man, and to your

<p>I can't answer for the whole Town; but the Corporation
is as well affected a Corporation as any in all <hi>England,</hi> and
I believe highly sensible of the Honour you intend them. No

you oppose him briskly, I dare answer for your Success.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Ha! do you think I fear to bleed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Be not so passionate, Sir; this I assure you, you will

may lay in your Power to do some Services to this Town.</p>

<sp>

<p>Be assur'd it does. I will, for your sake, preserve it
for ever from any Insults. No Armies shall ever do you any
Harm.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>May.</speaker>
<p>I assure you, Sir, that will recommend you very much:
If you can keep Soldiers from quartering upon us, we shall
make very little Difficulty in the Affair: But I-hope your Honour
will consider that the Town is very poor, Sir; a little
Circulation of Money among us would—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Sir, you make me concern'd that it is not now in my
Power to give whatever you desire; but rest secure of this, there
is not one whom you shall recommend, that shall not, within
this Twelvemonth, be Governor of an Island.</p>
</sp>

<p>This is a Courtier, I find, by his Promises.</p>

<p>But who is this Knight whom I am to encounter? Is
he now in the Castle?</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, he is now at <hi>Loveland</hi> Castle, a Seat of his
about ten Miles off. He was here the very Day before your
Honour came to Town, randying for a Knight of his Acquaintance,
with no less than Six Hundred Freeholders at his
Heels.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Humph! those are a sort of Soldiers I never heard of
in <hi>Spain.</hi>—How were they arm'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>May.</speaker>
<p>Arm'd, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="24" facs="39"/>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Ay; with Carbines, with Muskets, Spears, Pistols,
Swords, or how? I ask, that I may choose proper Weapons
to encounter them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>May.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha! your Honour is pleas'd to be merry; why
truly, Sir, they were pretty well arm'd when they went out
of Town; every Man had four or five Bottles in his Head at
least.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Base-born Cowards! who owe their Courage to the
Spirit of their Wine! But be easy, Sir, within these two
Days not one of them shall be alive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>May.</speaker>
<p>Marry, Heaven forbid! Some of them are as honest
Gentlemen as any in the County.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Ha! honest! and in the Train of the Knight of the
<hi>Long-Purse</hi>! Do I not know him to be a Deflowerer of Virgins,
a Destroyer of Orphans, a Despoiler of Widows, a Debaucher
of Wives—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>May.</speaker>
<p>Who, Sir <hi>Thomas Loveland,</hi> Sir? Why, you don't
know him. He's as good-natur'd, civil a Gentleman, as a
Man may say—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Why then do you petition me against him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>May.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir, for that matter, let him be as civil as he pleases,
one Man's Money is as good as another's. You seem to
be a civil Gentleman too; and if you stand against him, I don't
know which would carry it: But this, I believe, you guess
already, that he who spends most would not have the least
Chance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Ha! Caitif! dost thou think I would condescend to be
the Patron of a Place so mercenary? If my Services cannot
procure me the Election, dost thou think my Money should
make me their Knight? What should I get by undertaking the
Protection of this City and Castle, but Dangers, Difficulties,
Tolls, and Inchantments? Hence from my Sight! or by the
peerless <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Eyes, thy Blood shall pay the Affront thou
hast given my Honour.—Was it for this that I was chosen
in full Senate the <hi>Patron of la Mancha</hi>? Gods! to what will
Mankind degenerate! where not only the vile Necessaries of

Life; but even Honours, which should be the Reward of Virtue

<p>Faith, noble Squire, I wish you had spoke a little

<p>Well, but hang it, hast thou no body?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I have not one Guest in the House, Sir, but a young

himself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Badg.</speaker>
<p>Squire! who, pr'ythee?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>Squire—It is a cursed hard Name, I never can remember

been here in my House this Month, and I can't tell what to
make of 'em; I wish the Devil had 'em before I had seen 'em,
the Squire and his Master both.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Badg.</speaker>
<p>What, has the Squire a Master?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>I don't know which is Master, nor which is Man, not
I; sometimes I think one is Master, and then again I think it is
t'other.—I am sure I had rather be the Squire, for he sleeps
most, and eats most; he is as bad as a Grayhound in a House;
there is no laying down any thing eatable, but if you turn your
Back, slap, he has it up. As for the Knight, as he calls
himself, he has more to pay for breaking Windows, than eating:
Wou'd I were well rid of him! He will sit you sometimes
in the Yard to guard the Castle, as he calls it; but I am
afraid his Design is to rob the House, if he could catch an Opportunity.
<pb n="26" facs="41"/>
I don't understand one Word in ten of what he
says; he talks of Giants, and Castles, and Queens, and Princesses,

<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, I have been seeking your Honour, I have such
News to tell you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p><hi>Sancho,</hi> uncase this Instant, and handle that Squire as
he deserves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>My Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> Sir—</p>

<p>But, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>If thou expectest to live a Moment, answer me not a
Word, 'till that Caitif hath felt thy Fist.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir, with all my Heart, as far as a Cuff or two
goes.—I hate your Squire-Errants that carry Arms about
them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Badge.</speaker>
<p>I'll box you first one Hand, second with both. Sirrah,
I am able to beat a Dozen of you.—If I don't lamb
thee!—</p>
<stage>[They both strip.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>May be not, Brother Squire, may be not; threatned
Folks live long; high Words break no Bones; many walk into
a Battle, and are carry'd out on't; one Ounce of Heart is
better than many Stone of Flesh; dead Men pay no Surgeons;
safer to dance after a Fiddle than a Drum, tho' not so honourable;
a wise Man would be a Soldier in time of Peace, and a
Parson in time of War.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Badg.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir, and you would have been merry too, had
you seen such a Sight as I have. Here is a Fellow in this Inn,
that outdoes all the Shows I ever saw. He was going to
knock my Brains out for drinking my Mistress's Health.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fair.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps he is your Rival, Sir.</p>

Mrs. <hi>Dorothea,</hi> you have a very strange sort of a Taste, I can
tell you that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fair.</speaker>
<p>Do you travel towards <hi>London,</hi> Sir? because I shall
be glad of your Company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Badg.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, I have not above Fifteen short Miles to go,
and quite across the Country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fair.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps you are going to Sir <hi>Thomas Loveland</hi>'s?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Badg.</speaker>
<p>Do you know Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> then, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fair.</speaker>
<p>Very intimately well, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Badg.</speaker>
<p>Give me your Hand, Sir.—You are an-honest Cock,
I warrant you.—Why, Sir, I am going to fall in Love with
Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="33" facs="48"/>
<speaker>Fair.</speaker>
<p>You can't avoid that, Sir, if you see her; for she is the
most agreeable Woman in the World</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Badg.</speaker>
<p>And then she sings like a Nightingale! Now that is a
very fine Quality in a Wife; for you know, the more she sings,
the less she'll talk. Some Folks like Women for their Wit;
Odsbodlikins! it is a sign they have none of their own; there is
nothing a Man of good Sense dreads so much in a Wife, as
her having more Sense than himself.</p>

<p>But why bootted and spurr'd, Mr. <hi>Sancho</hi>? Are you going
a Journey?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Madam, your Ladyship knows I was ordered to
go for my Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi>; so what does me I, but rides into
the Kitchen, where I whipt and spurr'd about a Sirloin of rost
Beef, for a full half Hour. Then slap, I return'd to my
Master, whom I found leaning upon his Spear, with his Eyes
lifted up to the Stars, calling out upon my <hi>Toboso</hi> Lady, as if
the Devil were in his Guts; as soon as he sees me, <hi>Sancho,</hi>
says he, with a Voice like a great Gun, wilt thou never have
sufficiently stuffed thy Wallet? Wilt thou never set out for
<hi>Toboso</hi>? Heavens bless your Honour's Worship, and keep you
in your Senses, says I; I am just return'd from thence; I am
sure, if you felt half the Weariness in your Bones that I do,
you'd think you set out with a Vengeance. Truly then, <hi>Sancho,</hi>
thou must have travelled by Chantment. I don't know
<pb n="44" facs="59"/>
whether I travelled by Chantment; but this I know, that about
Five Miles off I met my Lady <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> How! says he,
and gave such a Spring, I thought he would have leapt over the
Wall. Ay, says I, sure I know her Ladyship. He that has
stood in the Piliory ought to know what Wood it is made of;
and a Woman, who walks the Streets, ought to know whether
they are pav'd or no.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Jez.</speaker>
<p>I hope he won't offer to be rude.</p>
</sp>

<p>Your Ladyship need not fear that. I dare swear he
loves your Ladyship so much, he would not take a Hundred
Pound to come within a Yard of you; he's one of your high
bred sort of Gentry, and knows his Distance.</p>

him a little more for your Arrival.</p>

handle him in such a Manner, that the rest of his Life shall not
be much worth wishing for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Thus on my Knees, Sir, I intreat you by all the Tenderness
you ever profess'd to me! by all the Joy you have so
often said I gave you! by all the Pain I now endure! do not
attempt to injure <hi>Fairlove.</hi> You can inflict no Punishment on
him, but I must feel much more than half. Is it not enough to
pull me, tear me bleeding from his Heart? Is it not enough to
rob my Eyes of what they love more than Light or than themselves?
Hinder me from all those Scenes of Bliss, I'd painted to
my self? Oh, hear me, Sir, or kill me, and do not make this Life
you gave a Curse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>Away, you're no Child of mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Wou'd you keep me from him, try to make him happy;
that Thought would be some Comfort in his Absence—I might
perhaps bear to be no Partaker of his Happiness, but not so of
his Sufferings; were he in a Palace, you might keep me wretched
alone; but were he in a Prison, not all the Powers on Earth
should keep me from him.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, and an't I making Addresses to her, Sir,

<p>Let me beseech you, Sir, to attack her in no rude

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Badg.</speaker>
<p>Pr'ythee, dost thou know who I am? I fansy if thou did'st
know who I was, thou wou'dst not talk to me so; if thou dost
any more, I shall lend thee a Knock. Come, Madam, since I
have promis'd to marry you, since I can't be off with Honour,
as they say; why, the sooner it's done, the better; let us send
for a Parson and be married, now I'm in the Humour. 'Sbodlikins!
I find there's nothing in making Love, when a Man's
<pb n="58" facs="73"/>
but once got well into't. I never made a Word of Love before
in my Life; and yet it is as natural, seemingly, as if I had
been bound Prentice to it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>Sir, one Word with you, if you please; I suppose
you look upon your self as a reasonable sort of Person.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>That you are capable of managing your Affairs; that
you don't stand in need of a Governor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>Hey!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>And if this be true of you, is it possible you can prefer
that Wretch, who is a Scandal to his very Species, to this
Gentleman, whose Person and Parts would be an Honour to
the greatest of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>Has he made you his Advocate? Tell him, I can
prefer Three Thousand to One.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quix.</speaker>
<p>The usual Madness of Mankind! Do you marry
your Daughter for her sake, or your own? If for her's, sure
'tis something whimsical, to make her miserable in order to
make her happy. Money is a Thing well worth considering in
these Affairs; but Parents always regard it too much, and Lovers
too little. No Match can be happy, which Love and Fortune
do not conspire to make so. The greatest Addition of
either, illy supplies the intire Absence of the other; nor wou'd
Millions a Year make that Beast, in your Daughter's Eye, preferable
to this Youth with a Thousand.</p>

well as you. Your Daughter has affronted me here. Sir, what's
