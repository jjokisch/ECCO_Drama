<head>To His GRACE WRIOTHESLY, DUKE of BEDFORD.</head>
<opener><salute>May it please your Grace,</salute></opener>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the just Prerogative of true Greatness to be universally admir'd by all; and one so eminently possess'd of it as your Grace, can no more escape the Tribute of our Praise and Admiration, than you can cease to deserve it: Not that 'tis in the Power of any one, or even the Applause of Multitudes, to reach half your Merit, yet may we be allow'd, according to the Proportion of our poor Stock, to throw in our Mite; and not be frightned from the Hopes of your Grace's Patronage, by considering the Unworthiness of the Offering; for were none but worthy Offerings made, the Gods themselves wou'd lose their Sacrifice; and they that deserve most our Praise shou'd have it least, because 'tis hardest to give them their Due.</p>
<p>And 'tis impossible, my Lord, this Poem should find Sanctuary any where but in the Umbrage of your Favour, for the Eyes of all Mankind are so fixt upon your Grace, that 'twou'd be a Disappointment to the Publick. to lay at any other's Door, what is so much your Duee And tho' I hit not a <hi>Wildair</hi> for the Humour of the
<pb facs="5"/>
Town in my Play, I may boldly say I have copied the greatest Part of Mankind in the just Admiration of your Grace.</p>
<p>Your particular Art, in appearing free, complaisant and conversible, without quitting a Noble Greatness proper to yourself, makes us at once approach you with Freedom and with Awe: Your Goodness, that makes you stoop to your Inferiors, loses nothing by being view'd near at hand, but is the more admir'd for it; and thus we consider your Grace arriv'd at the Height of Greatness, without a mortifying Reflection on the Lowness of our own Condition; nor does the World envy the truly Great, who by their Goodness and Affability make Mankind partake of their Felicity.</p>
<p>I may plead Prescription in Excuse of this Presumption, and tell how Poets in all Ages have pretended a Right to lay their Works at some Nobleman's Feet; but I'd rather submit to your Grace's Goodness; for if I have offended, 'tis a Fault of the best kind, and proceeds from too much Zeal to let the World know how much I am,</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> SHOULD not trouble my Reader with a Preface, if Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> had taught Manners to <hi>Masks,</hi> Sense to <hi>Beaus,</hi> and Good Nature to <hi>Criticks,</hi> as well as Morality to the Stage; the first are sure to envy what they can't equal, and condemn what they don't understand; the <hi>Beaus</hi> usually take a greater Liberty with our Sex than they wou'd with their own, because there's no Fear of drawing a Duel upon their Hands; the latter are a Sort of rude splenatick Men, that seldom commend any thing but what they have had a Hand in. These snarling Sparks were pleas'd to carp at one or two Expressions, which are spoken in 'em Aside by one of the inferior Characters in the Drama; and without considering the Reputation of the Persons in whose Mouths the Language is put, condemn it strait for loose and obscure: Now (with Submission to better Judges) I cannot believe that a Prayer-Book shou'd be put into the Hands of a Woman, whose innate Virtue won't secure her Reputation; nor is it reasonable to expect a Person, whose Inclinations are always forming Projects to the Dishonour of her Husband, shou'd deliver her Commands to her Confident in the Words of a Psalm. I heartily wish that those that find fault with the Liberty of my Stile, wou'd be pleas'd to set a Pattern to the Town, by retrenching some of their Debaucheries, for Modesty thrives best by Example. Modest Language from the truly Virtuous is expected; I mean such as will neither act ill, nor suffer ill to be acted: It is not enough that <hi>Lucy</hi> says she's honest, in having denied the Brutal Part; who ever thinks Virtue centers in that, has a wrong Notion of it; no, Virtue is a tender Plant, which cannot live in tainted Ground; Virtue is what the Air
<pb facs="7"/>
of Flattery cannot blast, nor the vile sordid Dross of Gain poison; and she that can withstand these two Shocks, may be stil'd truly Virtuous. I ask my Reader's Pardon for my Bluntness, but I hope none of my Sex so qualified will condemn me for exposing the Vices of the seeming Religious</p>
<p>I fear there are but too many hit by the Character of Signora <hi>Pizalta;</hi> I wish, for the sake of the reverse Party, there were fewer, or they better known, since the malicious World are so apt to judge of Peoples Inclinations by the Company they keep; which is sometimes authentick, but not always an infallible Rule. I shall say little in Justification of the Play, only desire the Reader to judge impartially, and not condemn it by the Shortness of its Life, since the Season of the Year never promis'd much better Success. It went off with general Applause; and 'tis the Opinion of some of our best Judges, that it only wanted the Addition of good Actors, and a full Town, to have brought me a Sixth Night, there having been worse Plays within this Twelve-month approv'd of.</p>

<byline>By a GENTLEMAN.</byline>
<stage>Spoken by Mrs. OLDFIELD.</stage>
<l><seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>UCH dreadful Laws of late 'gainst Wit are made,</l>
<l>It dares not in the City show its Head.</l>
<l>No Place is safe; each Cuckold turns Informer,</l>
<l>If we make merry—it must be in a Corner.</l>
<l>And here's To-night, what doubly makes it sweet,</l>
<l>A private Table, and a Lady's Treat:</l>
<l>At her Reflections none can be uneasy,</l>
<l>When the kind Creature does her best to please ye.</l>
<l>Humbly she sues, and 'tis not for your Glory</l>
<l>T'insult a Lady—when she falls before ye.</l>
<l>But since no human Wit can stand the Test,</l>
<l>With <hi>Gorman!</hi> and the <hi>Champion of the West!</hi></l>
<l>She'll fill the Lists, and then you cannot slight her,</l>
<l>(With Honour safe) for she's <hi>a fair Inviter.</hi></l>
<l>Expects no Favour, but at Honour's Call,</l>
<l>Defies the boldest <hi>Briton</hi> of you all;</l>
<l>Whate'er's her Fate, she's sure to gain the Field,</l>
<l>For Women always conquer, when they yeild.</l>

<l>They now plead Guilty: And confess the Stage</l>
<l>Has been immoral, and debauch'd the Age.</l>
<l>Nay, they will mend—But wish that in their Station,</l>
<l>All Men were pleas'd to forward Reformation.</l>
<l>First, let no Politicians, with vain Fears,</l>
<l>About suceeeding Kings create new Jars;</l>
<l>Let Lawyers now no more perplex the Laws,</l>
<l>Nor with malicious Quibbles split a Cause;</l>
<l>Let Magistrates consider 'tis but fitting,</l>

<l>Let our young Heroes, who would be Commanders,</l>
<l>Brag less o'er Coffee, and fight more in <hi>Flanders;</hi></l>
<l>Let <hi>Cheapside</hi> Doctors in a frantick Fit,</l>
<l>No more make impious War with sacred Wit;</l>
<l>Let City Wives (but that's too hard a Task)</l>
<l>Mimick no more Town-Ladies in a Mask,</l>
<l>Nor from their Prentices the Favour ask;</l>
<l><pb facs="10"/>Let no old cast-off Miss assume the Saint,</l>
<l>Let Cowards cease to huff, and Beaus to paint;</l>
<l>Let at yond Corner House the Wits and Bards,</l>
<l>Gain by Religion, what they lose at Cards;</l>
<l>Let snarling peevish Criticks cease to bite,</l>
<l>Or in a false Sublime dull Plays to write;</l>
<l>Let Galleries no more for Judges sit,</l>
<l>But leave to the bright Boxes, and the Pit,</l>
<l>Their lawful Empire o'er immortal Wit.</l>
<l>When all this heavy Task is well perform'd,</l>
<l>We dare ingage the Stage shall be reform'd.</l>

<l>His Education at the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi></l>
<l>Has still refin'd what he receiv'd from Nature;</l>
<l>His Person too is charming—</l>
<l>And, what most Women court, he has a Title—</l>

<l>With his Estate, and tho' his Equipage</l>
<l>Denotes an ample Fortune, yet we see</l>
<l>Many a Stranger here, during the Carnival,</l>
<l>Who makes a Figure by industrious Gaming.</l>
<l>As for <hi>Alonzo,</hi> he was born at <hi>Venice,</hi></l>
<l>Of Noble Parents; his Estate, a large one—</l>
<l>Even from his Youth you had his amorous Wishes,</l>
<l>And as he grew in Years his Love encreas'd:</l>
<l>You lov'd him too—Nay, which is more, your Father</l>
<l>Approv'd your mutual Loves, and at his Death</l>
<l>Bequeath'd you to <hi>Alonzo.</hi></l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I did; I found him in his Study, reading the Lover's Watch, which he swears does not at all agree with his Constitution. He hates Injunctions of Love, like those of Penance: For the one, says he, is no more pleasurable to the Body, than the other beneficial to the Soul.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. <hi>Piz.</hi></speaker>
<p>What a fine Gallant I'm like to have with these Principles! Well—what did he say to a Summons from a Woman of my Quality? Did it not make him wish the Time of Assignation were sooner than the Appointment in the Letter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>He first hum'd over your Billet; and pausing a while, he desir'd me to stay for an Answer in a next Room; then coming to me, he ask'd me what Countrywoman you were? For, said he, if she should prove an old Acquaintance, I would use her damnably—But when I and assur'd him you never saw the Outside of these Walls, he began to have that Desire which all Men have to a new Face</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. <hi>Piz.</hi></speaker>
<p>Very well; and what then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<p>He strait enquir'd whether you were black, brown, fair, old, young, Maid, Wife or Widow? I told him you was a wretched Wise to an old, impotent,
<pb n="27" facs="26"/>
rich, covetous, noble <hi>Venetian</hi>; beautiful, young, generous, and of a fair Complexion. He hugg'd me at these Words, seem'd transported with the News, and swore that in Intrigues, a Wife was most suitable to his Temper; for, said he, there's neither Children to father, nor Honour to repair: and where his Pocket and Liberty are safe, he is contented to venture his Body and Soul,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. <hi>Piz.</hi></speaker>
<p>Excellent Maxims!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>In short, Madam, he says he has had several Bills of this Nature drawn upon him of late, and how much his Stock may be exhausted, he knows not; but however he'll meet you, and if he cannot answer your Expectation, he'll give you Earnest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. <hi>Piz.</hi></speaker>
<p>You talk merrily, Girl; I hope you did not tell my Name. I should be loath to trust a Man of his Character with my Reputation at first Dash.</p>

<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>No, Madam, I only told your Quality.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. <hi>Piz.</hi></speaker>
<p>That's well: Oh! Reputation, what several Sorts of Slavery do we undergo to preserve thee! for to be thought virtuous, we are forced to be constantly railing against Vice, tho' our Tongues and Maxims seldom agree.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. <hi>Piz.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well—Men use us very barbarously: They will neither suffer us to be honest, nor allow us to be thought so—Here, take this Key, and secure every thing that concerns my Reputation: And if my Husband wakes ere I come back, you may easily find some Excuse to prevent his Enquiries; for the Carnival allows us more Liberty, than at other times we dare pretend to—I know thy Honesty, and will rely upon't.</p>

<p>No Injury, say you, my Lord? Why, I wonder you should be so jealous of my Lady, and preach such religious Maxims to her, when your own Principles are quite opposite.</p>

Indeed, if you lov'd me as much as you say, and would make my Fortune, (for I should love extreamly to be a Lady) I cannot tell how far you might persuade me—I know my Reputation would be safe in your Hands.</p>

<p>Make thy Fortune!

<p>Yes, Faith, Madam; and what Constitution I am of too.

<l>I ought to have treated you before the Face</l>
<l>Of false <hi>Aurelia</hi>—But I scorn to follow</l>
<l>The barbarous Custom of my native Country,</l>
<l>I seek with Honour to revenge my Wrongs;</l>
<l>Therefore, Sir, draw—</l>

<l>Dispose of that base, false, perjur'd <hi>Aurelia,</hi></l>
<l>As both his Love and Honour shall direct.</l>
<l>If my propitious Stars defend my Life,</l>

<l>Yes: She's my Wife.</l>

<l>If the Command of an expiring Father,</l>

<l>Indeed the Marriage Rites are yet to come,</l>
<l>Which slily she delay'd these two Months past,</l>
<l>On slight Pretence of finishing the Time</l>
<l>Of Mourning for her Father—But 'tis plain,</l>
<l>I was a Property to your base Love,</l>
<l>And only design'd to fill up your Place,</l>
<l>When surfeited you should return to <hi>Turin.</hi></l>

<l>Oh! Woman! Woman! <stage>[Aside.</stage></l>
<l>Yes, I will draw—But ere the fatal Stroke</l>
<l>Is past Recal, I swear <hi>Aurelia</hi>'s Virtue,</l>
<l>Is clear and spotless, like <hi>Diana</hi>'s self:</l>
<l>Nor was I prompted on this early Visit,</l>
<l>But with Design to take my last Farewel,</l>
<l>Having last Night received my Prince's Orders</l>
<l>To haste to <hi>Turin</hi>—Therefore if I fall,</l>
<l>I hope she'll meet with Mercy—Now come on.</l>

<l>Hold, hold, my Lord; Oh! could I credit this,</l>
<l>I would ask Pardon, and entreat your Friendship.</l>

<l>'Tis true, upon my Honour—</l>

<l>Madam, I was inform'd that Count <hi>Bassino</hi></l>
<l>Was to be here—and having Things t'impart</l>
<l>That much concern him, I made bold to come—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<l>Sir, I expect him straight—if you're his Friend</l>
<l>I will account you mine—Be pleas'd to sit.</l>
<stage>[Both sit.</stage>
</sp>

<l>My Brother, Madam, is extreamly happy</l>
<l>In being favour'd by so fair a Lady—</l>

<l>Your Brother, Sir! is then my Lord your Brother?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pla.</speaker>
<l>Madam, he is.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<l>Then I may call you Brother too;</l>
<l>For all the solemn Vows of Love have pass'd</l>
<l>'Twixt him and me—And blissful <hi>Hymen</hi> waits</l>
<l>With lighted Torch to tie the sacred Knot,</l>
<l>Which shall be done this Honr—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pla.</speaker>
<l>This hour! say you? Oh! Madam, have a Care:</l>
<l>You tread inchanted Ground, and e'er you know</l>
<l>What Path you take, you're hurried to Destruction.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Where lies the Danger?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pla.</speaker>
<l>Oh! 'Tis a fatal Tale, yet you must hear it;</l>
<l>Therefore summon your Courage to your Aid,</l>
<l>For you will need it all, whilst I relate</l>
<l>The fatal Story—</l>
</sp>

<l>Ah! how I tremble!</l>
<l>Say, is he dead? has any murderous Villain</l>
<l>Kill'd my <hi>Bassino?</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pla.</speaker>
<l>No—he is well in Health: but his distemper'd Mind</l>
<l>Is of a wild and feverish Disposition,</l>
<l>Longing to taste, what tasted will undo him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aur.</speaker>
<l>Your speech is all a Riddle: Pray speak plainer:</l>
<l>But yet, e'er you proceed, if Count <hi>Bassino</hi> lives,</l>

<l>No, he's not yours—Nor ever must.</l>

<l>'Tis false—There's not a Pow'r on Earth can part us:</l>
<l>Perhaps,</l>
<l>You think my Blood to base to mix with yours—</l>
<l>But, Sir, your Brother loves me, and in Love</l>
<l>All Ranks are equal—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pla.</speaker>
<l>No—I wish that were all:</l>
<l>But there's a greater Obstacle—He—is—married—</l>

<l>Madam, I swear, whate're I said is Truth—</l>
<l>Do but defer this Marriage for a Day</l>
<l>And if I don't produce convincing Proofs,</l>

<l>Fall on my perjur'd Head—</l>

<l>Bold Arrogance!</l>
<l>Oh! That he were but here to answer the Affront!</l>
<l>Perhaps he may have wrong'd your Family:</l>
<l>Debauch'd your Sister; for which you would force him</l>
<l>To marry her?—But, I must tell thee, Boy,</l>
<l>He's mine already: nor would he forsake me</l>
<l>To hold Command o'er all the Universe.</l>

<l>That dares to treat me thus—Know, Madam,</l>
<l>I am his Wife—his lawful wedded Wife.</l>
<l>With borrow'd Shape I came to try your Virtue,</l>
<l>Which I have found so light, that the least Puff</l>
<l>Of wanton Love will blast it—Else my Visit</l>
