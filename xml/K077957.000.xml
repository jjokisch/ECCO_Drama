<p><seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Should believe Mr. <hi>Cuningham</hi> very constant, if I had Faith enough to credit this Letter, <hi>Jeffry.</hi> What Complaints are here? But 'tis the Stile, that all young Lovers write.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Madam, believe me; you know I am a Man of Integrity: I cannot dissemble. Let him write what he pleases, If he did not love you, do you think I'd tell you so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>When he has Opportunity, I must confess, he says kind things to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Take my Word, Madam, my Master is not like other Men—Unless he loves a Lady, and loves her passionately too, he never troubles himself to compliment her much.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>Never? Yes, <hi>Jeffry;</hi> sometimes, you know, he compliments my Aunt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>That's a convincing Proof of his Love to you; you cannot think him reduc'd to the Necessity of making Love to an antiquated Piece, with design to know her otherwise, than to obtain the Happiness of seeing you? But I shall tell him, Madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>Tell him I have receiv'd and read his Letter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Is that all, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>All! Yes. Are you not content with that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Any indifferent Person, that had Hands, and could but read, would have done, as much, as that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>Well; Tell him then, in time perhaps I may—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>My Master, Madam, can't endure to depend on a perhaps.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Prudence.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Quick, quick, up to your Chamber, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>What's the Matter? Is my Aunt coming hither?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>She's at your Heels. Go up the Back-Stairs quickly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>Farewel, <hi>Jeffry;</hi> Commend me to thy Master. <stage><hi>Exit</hi> Phil.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>For what, I beseech you? Is not my Master bewitc'd, to court a Lady a whole Year, and she hardly tell him she loves him yet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="5" ana="y"/>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Alas! She's but a Novice. Let me alone with her; I'll order the Business so, that if thy Master be discreet and passionate enough in his Expressions, he wins her Heart I'll warrant you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>He can say nothing to her, but that damn'd Aunt of hers is harkning to't still. What Pleasure can she find in Love at Fifty?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Fie, <hi>Jeffry,</hi> you must say Five and twenty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>I wonder any Woman can have the Impudence to live, and trouble Mankind after that Age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>There never was a Woman so old, but she retain'd a good Opinion of her self.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Then she dresses her self so fantastically, that all may see she strives to appear Young in defiance of Nature. She is more gawdy in that she calls Half-Mourning, than a young Bride is on her Wedding-Night. The Devil's in her if she believes any one can love her: 'Tis jeering her, but to be commonly civil to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>A little Flattery fires her. She believes all, that is said to her: And he that does not make love to her, and compliment her, shall not be twice admitted to her House.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>O reverend Beauty! on my Conscience, if I would grease her Chops with a few Compliments, she'd mump and smile upon me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>No doubt on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>When shall my Master have an Opportunity to speak freely to <hi>Philadelphia?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Lovemore</hi> is thy Master's Friend, and is better belov'd here, than he imagines You must persuade him to amuse the Aunt, that Mr. <hi>Cuningham</hi> may have Convenience to court the Niece.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Lovemore</hi>'s tir'd with playing that part so often; he is cloy'd with the Aunt, and swears he'll have no more of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="6"/>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>I'm sure her Niece and I endure much more. Tell him, 'twill be Charity in him to relieve us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>'Twill be hard to persuade him to it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>This old Lady of mine has languish'd for a young Husband ever since Sir <hi>Oliver Laycock</hi> dy'd: She cares not what Estate he has, or what Religion he's of, so he be but young and lusty. Where is the great Viscount <hi>Sans Terre,</hi> thy Master told her of? Methinks he's long a coming.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Some cross unlucky Business hinders him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>She has lately receiv'd some Letters, that have given a full Account of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>So much the worse. What is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>They say his Fortune is not very much, but he is greatly born, and very pleasant; and that he is so great a Lover of Musick, he has not a Servant but can Sing or Dance, or Play upon some Instrument. You may know when he's come by the Noise; the Fiddlers will welcome him to Town; for all from <hi>Westminster</hi> to <hi>Wapping</hi> pay him Homage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Wou'd he were but marry'd to her, <hi>Prudence.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Whether he marries her or not, is not our Business, <hi>Jeffry.</hi> Let him but fool with us till thy Master has gain'd her Niece, and then our Work is done.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Well, we have had enough of thy old Lady <hi>Laycock.</hi> Let us now talk of our own Affairs; speak, dost thou love me, <hi>Prudence?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>A pleasant Question! Do you doubt it now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>If you would have me credit you, swear it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Sure you are jealous <hi>Jeffry?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>You're somewhat near the Matter. I know your Humour well enough; you love a bold audacious Fellow, that will say any thing, and such a one we have come to Town, one <hi>Merryman</hi> our Falconer; I fear you'll like him better than you do me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="7"/>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Oh Fool! why should you think so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>I have some Honour in me; but he's a Fellow that has eaten Shame, and drank after it. He is more impudent than a Court Page, and will take no Denial.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Hold your Tongue, here's my Lady.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Lady <hi>Laycock.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>What Business has <hi>Jeffry</hi> with you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>His Master sent him to know, whether he might have leave to wait upon your Ladyship this Morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Yes; Tell him, I expect him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>He durst not come, because Mr. <hi>Lovemore</hi>'s with him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Go tell 'em, if they please to come, they shall be welcome both.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>I shall, Madam. <stage><hi>(Exit</hi> Jeffrey.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>You see what Power your Beauty has. Neither can live a Moment without seeing you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>No, they have other Business with me, <hi>Prudence;</hi> they came from <hi>Paris</hi> lately, and brought me a Letter from my Brother; and I believe they come for my Answer now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>But does not one of 'em love you, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I have some Reason to believe he does; Mr. <hi>Lovemore</hi> has spar'd no Pains to persuade me to quit my Widow-hood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>I have been told, Madam, that Widow-hood is a Gift, Heaven seldom bestows but on its Favourites; you are rich, and know how troublesome Marriage is. For my part, I believe the fairest Hair, the beautiful'st Curls do not become your Fore-head so well as <hi>Bando</hi> did; but every one, Madam, knows their own Necessities.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="8"/>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I confess, Widow-hood has its Conveniencies; but if Marriage be a Trouble to some, 'tis a Pleasure to others, <hi>Prudence.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>You had the Experience of it thirty Years, how did you like it, Madam? They say, Sir <hi>Oliver Laycock</hi> lov'd your Ladyship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>For all that he was jealous; and, what's worse, was Old.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Very well; therefore you resolve to have a young One now, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>You cannot blame me for that? Can you, <hi>Prudence?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Oh no, 'tis well known Youth is comfortable. But, methinks, you should take one a little nearer your own Age, Madam. A very young Man may be too treacherous for you, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Why, is my Age so visible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>No, Madam; with a little Help of Art you have some Remains of Beauty still. You have something about your Eyes as pleasant now, as others have at Twenty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a very malicious World we live in, <hi>Prudence;</hi> they are so apt to censure, and speak of any single Woman, that one ought to marry to avoid that Scandal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Some that are young are forc'd to marry, to avoid Detraction; others wou'd rather all that's Ill should be said of them, than to have no Notice taken of 'em. I knew a young Lady that pin'd to a Consumption, because she liv'd three Years about the Court, and never had the Honour to be lampoon'd. The Truth is, none that are Beautiful and Young can avoid Envy, but few are so malicious, to speak against the Old.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>There is no Age exempt from Scandal, <hi>Prudence.</hi> When we are Young, they say we sell our selves; when Old, we are forc'd to hire, to buy our Lovers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>You know what they say, Madam, of the old Marchioness, your Friend, that was so admir'd, so courted in her Youth; who, when she found she was forsook by all, was forc'd to hire a Player by the Quarter: How soon rhe poor Fellow was tir'd too! How like a Sheep-biter he look'd after the first two Months!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>This <hi>London</hi> is a very wicked Place, 'tis impossible to live without Scandal here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>I'm afraid they'll say as much of you, Madam, if you bargain for a Husband. To covet one, that is both Young and Rich, is too much in Conscience, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Thou know'st, <hi>Prudence,</hi> Wealth is not the thing I seek.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Then, Madam, the Business is done; the Viscount <hi>Sans-Terre</hi> shall be your Husband, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Ah <hi>Prudence!</hi> if he were but as handsome as—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Ah Madam, that's too much.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Why may not I wish for it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Consider his Quality, Madam, and 'bate him something for that. One thing I must advise you; be not too prodigal of your Gold at first; to be liberal sometimes will be convenient, and make him kinder to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>For all this, I should think my self very happy, if I were certain of Mr. <hi>Cuningham</hi> or Mr. <hi>Lovemore.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>A little Jealousy will inflame 'em. They'll be more pressing when the Viscount comes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>But yet methinks, <hi>Cuningham</hi> and my Neice—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>What, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Are always whispering.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>He only compliments her, Madam. She's too young to make Love seriously.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>With your Favour, there's no trusting to that. To my Knowledge, there are those younger, than she, that understand what Love is but too well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>That's true, Madam; but <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is so innocent, that no Man can make Love to her, but to divert himself. Here she is, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Philadelphia.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>What does she come for? I'll send her packing quickly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Consider what you do, Madam. How can Mr. <hi>Lovemore</hi> entertain your Ladyship, unless his Friend may divert himself the while with rallying with your Niece.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>For all that I could wish—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Pray trouble not your self. Trust me, I'll watch her, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>Will your Ladyship go to <hi>Eaton</hi>'s? The Coach is at the Door.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>No, I'll not go yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>If you stay long, Madam, the best <hi>Poynt</hi> will be sold before you come.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>No matter. Ha! what ails the Girl! How strangely she looks! Her Eyes are hardly open yet!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>How, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Then her Head's dress'd awry. How it disguises her! Lord! how frightfully it looks!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>Truly, Aunt, 'tis dress'd just as the Fashion is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Fetch her Hood, <hi>Prudence;</hi> I'll have her put it on till it be mended.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>I dress'd it to please no body but my self, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I'll have you dress your self now to please me: Come, put it on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>My Lady's in the Right. Never was any thing more ridiculous. Here, put on the Hood, I am sure this is much handsomer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Why don't you put it on?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I can't endure it, Madam—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Do, I say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>So; Now it is as it should be; all modest Maids should be dress'd so: But here's Mr. <hi>Cuningham</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lovemore.</hi></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Cuningham, Lovemore <hi>and</hi> Jeffry.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Your Servant, Madam; you see how we love your Company, by giving you this Trouble in a Morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a Happiness we are much envy'd for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>You are welcome, Gentlemen. Pray command this House as freely as your own.</p>

<p>Why does this Lady hide her Face? Pray, Madam, let us see you.</p>

<p>I thank your Ladyship for your Care of me. But the Pain has been gone so long, I don't fear it now.</p>

<sp>

<p>Nay then, we must have it off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<p>What say you, Madam, Shall I pull it off?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Impertinence; I see you have a Mind to shew your self.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>'Tis the Nature of all young Girls to do what they are forbidden.</p>

<p>I come not to trouble your Ladyship for your Letter to my Lawyer; your countenancing my Business will be of great Advantage to me.</p>

<p>Madam, You promis'd me that Honourable Title.</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Madam, more, than any one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I have not much Beauty to boast of; but Virtue, Sir, makes some amends for the Defects of the other.</p>

<p>Defects? <stage>(Cuningham <hi>Courts</hi> Philadelphia.</stage> Pray, Madam, wrong not your self so much.</p>

<p>There are few but know a little their own Value: And tho a Woman be not fam'd for a great Beauty, yet if she be agreeable, there are those, will like her well enough.</p>

<p>Extremely well: Was it your own Fancy, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>I am not asham'd to own it, since you ask it, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[They counterfeit to be talking about Fashions, whilst seemingly <hi>Lovemore</hi> Courts the Aunt.</stage>

<p>Faith, Madam, if you were not a Widow, I should think you a Girl scarce Twenty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>

<p>You do not know what Misery I endur'd whilst my old Husband liv'd. The Griefs I had upon me would have distracted another Woman. Alas! Sir, 'tis not Age but Sorrow has broke me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>It makes me sad to hear you tell it, Madam, and vexes me to think, an old Man should enjoy such Happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>You do not know how many Tears I have shed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and Fifteen to that. <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Having been so unfortunate in a Husband, you may believe I have but little Encouragement to venture, Sir, again. For I am very happy now I am alone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>You do wisely, Madam; for she deserves not to be pity'd, that rashly runs into the same Misfortune; and therefore you have, Madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir, I have not forsworn Marrying yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Madam, where do you use to walk in the Evening? Into St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Not very often, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Or into the Mulberry Garden?</p>
<p>Is not the Wilderness very pleasant?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>If I like my Company, Sir, I never mislike the Place.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Have you seen the new Paradise, Madam? 'Tis much superiour to the former.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Let me have the Honour to wait upon you thither presently.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Not yet, Sir; After Dinner, if you please. But tell me, Sir, do you think me such an Enemy to Marriage, that were I sure a young Gentleman lov'd
<pb n="14" facs="14"/>
me, and lov'd me truly, I would be so uncivil to refuse him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>When I consider what you endur'd in Sir <hi>Oliver Laycock</hi>'s time, I think you ought to do it, Madam; and that Man's unjust, that urges you to break your Resolution.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Pray do not mistake me, Sir; I have made no such Resolution yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Madam, since you are displeas'd at what I said, we'll change the Discourse. Pray, Madam, do you think the young Lord <hi>Lucky</hi> has that Interest at Court, that Fame reports he has?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Lord, Sir, this is a strange wild Answer to my Question. Let me tell you, Sir, if I have any Merit, Wealth or Beauty, there's one in the World deserves 'em all.</p>

<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Madam, what is this Marchioness?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir! a most eternal Talker: Her Tongue goes like the Larum of a Clock, as fast, and to the
<pb n="15" facs="15"/>
same Tune still. She's almost Sixty, and yet pretends to Beauty, and loves Courtship most unreasonably. Say but a kind thing to her, and you win her Heart. The Truth is, she has not much Reputation; but the Respect I give her is to her Quality and to her Person. But she's an Original in her kind, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Oh blind, blind Creature! she draws her own Picture, and laughs at it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Sure, Madam, her Conversation must be very pleasant?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>She has been much courted in her Youth; but 'twould make one die to hear her boast of her Lovers now. How this Knight sighs, and that Lord dies for her; when all the while I know what Necessity the poor Creature is reduc'd to. I would have brought her hither, but I know we never should have been rid of her. Excuse me a Moment, I'll send her away, and return presently. Your Servant, Gentlemen, <stage>Exit Lady.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>How now, Friend—What's the Matter? Why dost look so sullenly?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>I play the Ass here any longer! No; if I do, may I turn Pudding to a Rope-Dancer, and shew Tricks next <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Nay, but Friend, Dear Friend—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Tell not me of Friendship. What Man would endure to be so plagued as I have been. I have parry'd with my best Skill the dangerous Thrusts that ever were made at me. To tug at an Oar, or dig in a Mine in <hi>Peru,</hi> is Recreation to it. But the first time to offer Marriage to me! I sweat to think on it. It made me tremble twice, for fear she should have forc'd my Neck into her muddy Noose of Matrimony.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>We have no other way to blind her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>'Tis all one to me.</p>

<p>If thou lov'st my Life, Friend, do not forsake me now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Pray live, if you please, and give me leave to do so too. Should I again be left alone with her, the best I can hope for is Distraction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>How do you like the Niece?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>How do you thrive? Do you find her kind, Mr. <hi>Cuningham?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>She has promis'd me a Meeting this Afternoon, if thou canst but remove the Aunt from us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>I'll try what I can do, but Mr. <hi>Lovemore</hi> is the only Man in her Favour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Dear Friend, try but this one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>I'll be hang'd, drawn, and quarter'd for a Traitor first, and have my Limbs hung up for the Birds to feed upon. No, no, I have my Belly full, I thank you, and some to spare.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>But now I think on't, where's this Viscount all this while? His Arrival wou'd be of great use in this Affair.</p>

<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p><hi>Prudence</hi> advises well: Methinks he's long a coming.</p>

<p>Why, you must know, there is one <hi>Merryman</hi> just come up out of the Country-He is my Falconer upon occasion, the Fellow is bold, and very apt, and has not been seen much in Town. What think you of him to act awhile, till some more lucky Occasion present it self?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a lucky Thought, and may be of use. Where is he?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>In the Pantry, a ramming down a Wedge of Roast-Beef to keep out the Town Air, and making Sport with a simple Country Fellow he has brought out of the Country with him to see the Town; one <hi>Clodpole,</hi> he calls him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="17" facs="17"/>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>'Twould not be amiss to examine him, and instruct him how to behave himself, before he is too much known.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>No body of the Family has seen him▪ yet, but the Butler; and he, I know, will be secret.</p>
<p>I'll step and call him to you, Sir, if you please?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Do so. <stage><hi>(Exit</hi> Jeff.</stage></p>
<p>In the mean time, <hi>Prudence,</hi> there's something to buy thee a Pair of Gloves. <stage>(Gives her Money.</stage></p>

<p>Oh, dear Sir! how long have I deserved this? Please to command me any thing within my Power, and conclude it done.</p>

<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Well, Friend, dost think thou can'st act the Part of a Viscount for a little while?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Merr.</speaker>
<p>What sort of a Lord is he to be?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Oh! An Amorous Resolute sort of a Person, that's much given to love Musick. You shall have all things that's sitting for a Man of such Quality.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Merr.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir, let me be once set out with a good Equipage, and leave the rest to me.</p>

I believe, in a little time I must make it my whole Imploy to invite home young Gallants, forsooth, to pleasure you, whilst I, as if I were your Slave, must retire, and wait till you are serv'd first.

Methinks 'tis rare to hear a young brisk Fellow court a handsome young Lass, and she all the while making such pretty dumb Signs: first turns aside to see who observes, then spreads her Fan before her Face, heaves up her Breasts, and sighs—at which he still swears he loves her above all the World—and presses hard his Suit; tells her, what Force her Beauty, her Wit, her Shape, her Mien, all join'd in one, are of.

And I would have you to know, tho you have forc'd me to wed my self with old Age and ill Humours, I am not wedded to my Grave!—'tis time enough forty Years hence to think of that, and I have a great deal to do before that time comes; therefore I must, and I will go abroad.</p>

<p>No, no, not a Word.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clod.</speaker>
<p>For you must know, Mr. <hi>Lovemore</hi> charg'd me, when he sent me, to say never a Word.</p>

<p>I find you do know him.</p>

<p>Odd, he's a fine Gentleman as ever I met with in all my Life.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, he's a very fine Gentleman indeed.</p>
<p>I wou'd the Devil had him. <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clod.</speaker>
<p>He gave me this Piece of Gold to carry a Letter for him, which I deliver'd to the Gentlewoman of that House but now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Oh, he's a very civil Gentleman; I have been long acquainted with him.</p>
<p>Well, and what Answer did you get</p>
<p>A very pleasing one, I'll warrant you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clod.</speaker>
<p>Softly, you must not tell a Syllable of this to the Husband, nor that she'll send my Master an Answer, as soon as ever she can get the Cuckold out of the way. But no body must know. You understand me.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I'll keep your Counsel, never fear.</p>

<p>Ay.</p>

<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>She does.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Clod.</speaker>
<p>Odd, she's a pretty Bit; and then there's a handsome Maid that waits upon her, and is Assistant to her in these Matters, one <hi>Dam—Damaris,</hi> I think they call her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Ay, like enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clod.</speaker>
<p>And you must know I like her hugely. She gave me Two or Three such loving Looks, that I am half persuaded she likes me. So that if my Master gets acquainted with the Mistress, I intend to strike in with her Maid.</p>

<p>Good lack! And why so short, Son-in-law?</p>

<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>I shall grow taller in a little time, Good Mother-in-law, if this Trade holds. <stage>(Points to his Head.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Explain your Meaning, Son-in-law.</p>
</sp>

<p>'Twill explain it self shortly. <stage>(Walks up and down.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="36" facs="36"/>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>What, is that Hat of yours nail'd on? Do you know who we are? And the Respect due to Persons of our Quality, good Son-in-law?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Ah! wou'd I did not; but now I know to my Sorrow, since you will have me speak, good Mother-in-law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Will you never leave that saucy Word, of calling me Mother-in-law?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Good Lord! Why what must I call you then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>You ought to say, Madam and Sir, when you speak to us; or when you speak of us, you should say, Sir <hi>Peter,</hi> and her Ladyship: For tho' you have married our Daughter, yet there is a great deal of distinction betwixt you and Persons of our Rank and Quality.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Go to, it is enough for me to let him know his Duty, without your Instructions. Sure, I best know my self what to do. Son-in-law, you are an impudent Fellow to use us at this rate. How often must we put you in mind of your Duty and Respect, e'er you'll know it? Hence-forward learn to behave your self as you ought, or you shall hear on't in other sort of Terms. You must not think because you've married our Daughter, that we will be satisfied with such indifferent Ceremonies and Duty you might have paid, had you married one equal with your self; nor ought you indeed to say, your Wife, when you speak of our Daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Good lack!—Is not your Daughter my Wife?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>She is.—But you ought not to call her so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>I know that too well, now 'tis too late. I'd give a thousand Pounds she were not my Wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>At it again? I tell you, tho' you have married her, yet as she is our Daughter, you must not treat her after that familiar way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="37" facs="37"/>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>You make me mad—Is not my Wife my Wife?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>I tell you, tho' she be your Wife, you must not call her so. When you speak of her, as being our Daughter, you must say, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Well, Madam, then since it must be Madam, I did not care if she were a Dutchess, so I were but fairly rid of her.</p>
<p>Here's such a stir about your Gentility, and your Honour: But I believe if I had not married your Daughter, and with my good Money redeem'd your Estate, your Gentility had been left in the Mud—for all your great Families, and your nice Honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Then do you think it no Honour to be ally'd to the Worshipful Family of the <hi>Pride's.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>And to the Honourable Family of the <hi>Laycock's?</hi> Go, Clown. 'Tis a Shame our Daughter should be wedded to such a Brute. We have been told at what a rate you treat her. What is the Reason of it, Son-in-law?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Why, you shall know, good Mother-in-law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Again at that affronting way!</p>
<p>How often have you been told to say, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Well, Madam, then: I always forget these fine Words. But, Madam, if you wou'd please, Madam, to hear me speak, you shall know, Madam, whether I have not Cause to wish, I never had seen my Wi—your Daughter, Madam, if I must call her nothing else.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, Sir, proceed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Why, in the first Place, I am in a fair way to be made a Cuckold, if I am not one already.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>How, Son-in-law? Have a Care what you say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Believe me, what I say, I can make appear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Do it then presently.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="38" facs="38"/>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Why, she has just now receiv'd a Letter from her Gallant, and made an Appointment to meet him this Evening; and judge how small a time a Pair of Horns are a grafting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>How came you to know this, Son-in-law?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Why, just now—I caught the Fellow, that brought her the Letter, coming out of my House, and not knowing who I was, I got out of him all the Business; and that his Master, Mr. <hi>Lovemore</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Is that the Gentleman's Name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Yes, so his Man told me. I have often seen him taking a View about my House, and looking up to the Windows; and 'tis plain what his Designs were.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>If this be true, I'll tear her Eyes out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, if it be, this good Sword (never yet drawn in vain) shall do you Right.</p>
<p>Where is she, Son-in-law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Within, I'll warrant, studying what Excuse to make, to get abroad, and meet her Gallant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I'll call her to answer for her self.</p>
<p>Be sure you wrong her not, Son-in-law. <stage>(Exit Lady.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, I make no doubt but she is to be believ'd before me; and she ne'er wants Cunning to bring her self off, I'll say that for her, tho' the Case be ne'er so plain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>By this good Light, if she dares be false to her Marriage Vows, she dies; and that base Rifler of her Fame shall bear her Company.</p>

<p>How far you have endeavour'd to stain that spotless Fame, be judge your self.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, explain this Riddle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>I have a Daughter young, fair, well-bred, has Sense; she is indeed the Wonder of her Sex, and this Man, whom you see here, has the Honour to be married to her.</p>

<p>Ah! 'Tis an Honour, that I cou'd have spar'd.</p>
<stage>(Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Now, Sir, I'm told, that you endeavour to corrupt her Honour, and defile her Marriage-Bed. Sir, I have had the Honour to command abroad, and with Success, both to my King and my Country—As have also the Chief Part of all our great Race; even from <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> to this present Reign, have our unquestion'd Glories stood a Pattern to our yet rising Fame: And he who dares presume to rob us of that precious Jewel, Honour, must not think to scape unpunish'd, tho' with the Hazard o'th' last Drop of Blood, that is lest, to wash off the Stain. My Daughter's Honour, Sir, is as dear to me, as this vital Air, by which I breath and live.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Pray Sir, who told you this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Believe me, Sir, whate'er I say, I can quote my Author for it.</p>

</sp>

<p>How, Sir! Did you frame this abominable Falshood? 'Tis well you have the Honour to be ally'd to this worthy Knight, Sir <hi>Peter Pride,</hi> here; or you should know what it is to father such a Lie upon a Man of my Reputation.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>I tell him! Why, when did you make Love to me, Sir? I assure you, had you let me know of your Passion, it shou'd not have gone unrewarded. Pray, next time you send, let it be one that knows how to take more Care. However, you have no great Reason to despair; for since he complains without any manner of Reason, I am resolv'd he shall have Cause. Therefore if you do love me, Sir, pray let me know it, and I do assure you, you shall not want Encouragement. He shall not use me at this rate for nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Love.</speaker>
<p>Madam, believe me, 'tis all a Riddle to me; for, till this Hour, I never heard any thing mention'd like it: I am an absolute Stranger to it.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Well, Mr. <hi>Cuningham,</hi> I have long'd for some time to be alone with you, that I might speak more freely to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Madam, 'tis too great an Honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>I wonder, Sir, you never think of Marrying?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Madam, as yet I dare not think on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Oh, dear Sir! Pray, why so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Because I have not well consider'd it; and I have been told, 'tis a dangerous Undertaking, without having well thought before-hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="46" facs="46"/>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, why should you think so?</p>
<p>I'll vow 'tis an odd Thought, Sir, for one of your Understanding: Why, Sir, I'll tell you.</p>
<p>I have had Three Husbands, and yet I have no great Reason to complain: Tho' in my last Husband's time, I had not altogether that real Satisfaction, as I had with the other Two; for to deal freely with you, Sir, my Husband Sir <hi>Oliver Laycock,</hi> though he was a very well-bred Man, yet he had his Humours sometimes, and would be a little given to Jealousy, so that I seldom led a quiet Hour when the Fit was upon him. But in my first Husband's Days, sure never Woman liv'd so happy! I would not a-been unmarried to have had all the Riches of the Earth laid at my Feet: But when I married with Sir <hi>Oliver,</hi> and had once seen his Temper, nothing I had in the World but what I would a given to a been free again; and indeed in my Passion I often vow'd never (if please Heav'n Sir <hi>Oliver</hi> died) to marry any more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>'Twas rashly done.</p>
<p>But no doubt, were there that Man fitting to merit your Favour, and equally deserving your Person and your Estate, and one whom your Ladyship could like, you might perhaps be persuaded to break your Vow, and venture once again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>I'll swear I hardly think it, and yet one don't know how one may be tempted; tho' if I were to be persuaded, (and I will not forswear any thing) I know not any one, that can so soon persuade me to it as you, Mr. <hi>Cuningham.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Death and the Devil! What have I brought upon my self! <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
<p>Oh Madam! You make me blush.</p>
<p>But Madam! How cou'd you with Honour put off the Viscount, who you know loves you, and is come on purpose to marry you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="47" facs="47"/>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Why, I intend him for my Niece you must know, who no doubt will be much better pleas'd with the Change. For, to say Truth, Mr. <hi>Cuningham,</hi> I have always had more, than a common Esteem for you, and for your Behaviour; and have long since resolv'd, that if I do alter my Condition, you are the Man alone I have plac'd my Thoughts upon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>You make me blush, Madam.</p>
<p>Wou'd I were a League under-ground, or in any Hell but this. <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
<p>You cannot sure. <stage>(To her.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>I vow 'tis true, and yet—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Hear me but speak, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>'Tis odd, that Love shou'd over-power People at so strange a rate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>But I should be unjust to my Friend, who I know loves you dearer, than his Life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear! Who's that I beseech you, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Lovemore,</hi> Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Lovemore!</hi> I'll swear I don't believe it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Oh Madam! 'tis but too true, as will appear I'm afraid, when he knows you place your Affections on any other Man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>I'll vow you much surprize me, Mr. <hi>Cuningham;</hi> but how came you to know it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Oft has he begg'd me to bear him Company in some lonely Place, where he wou'd sigh, and tell such things of his distressed Passion, as wou'd have mov'd the most obdurate Heart; and when I ask'd him, why he did not acquaint your Ladyship with his Love, he would sigh, with Arms a-cross, as if his Heart would force its way through his Breast, and cry, Oh that's my Grief, my Friend, I cannot—dare not tell her! for should I attempt it once, and meet her scorn, (for oh! thou know'st her Vow) I shou'd be for ever lost.</p>
<p><pb n="48" facs="48"/>
Then ran o'er a thousand Tales of Love, so soft, so moving, and how he priz'd you, that cannot be express'd by any, except one, who loves like him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Truly, Sir, if it be so—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>If it be so! were your Ladyship to observe his distracted Throes, you'd pity him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>But why should he not declare it to me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>That's what I tell him, Madam;</p>
<p>Urging that your Ladyship—But mum! who have we here?</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Euter</hi> Viscount, Philadelphia <hi>and</hi> Prudence.</stage>

<p>Nay, pray my Lord, be not displeas'd. This Gentleman, you must know, has a Law suit depending, and is come to entreat a Line of Commendation from me to my Lawyer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>Enough; I do believe all you can say. Ah! those Eyes of yours! What Looks are there! they enflame my very Soul.</p>

<p>Ah, <hi>Prudence,</hi> how I long to be alone with him.</p>
</sp>

<p>Father-in-law, you're welcome; and you, Madam. I'm glad you are come, I was just going to send for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why, what's the Matter, Son-in-law?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Now you see what a fine Daughter you have.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>What! more Complaints! What is the Reason of all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Do but hear me, and you shall know.</p>
<p>Here has been her Gallant, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Son-in-law, I'll not believe it. Will you never leave this fooling? We'll hear no more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>No, no; I knew you wou'd never believe a Word I say; but she can be credited, because she's a Gentlewoman, forsooth. Now you shall see what a Gentlewoman I have got for a Wife. I have her fast now, fast in that Room with her Gallant, and that I hope will convince you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>'Tis false, thou base Villain. I know she scorns to do so base a thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Pray now don't believe me, but walk in: If you find it not true, never mind any thing I say, as long as I live.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Lead, Son-in law. If I find 'em together, by this good Sword they both shall die.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>But if 'tis not so, which I do believe 'tis only your Jealousy again, look to your self, Son-in-law, I'll suffer these Affronts no longer.</p>

<p>You must know, Madam, my Master was in Love else-where.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>How <hi>Jeffrey.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="64" facs="64"/>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>If your Ladyship will have Patience to hear me out, you shall know the whole Story.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>With all my Heart, <hi>Jeffrey.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Why, you must know, Madam, my Master had the Misfortune to quarrel with a Gentleman, who urg'd him to fight; my Master kill'd him: Upon which he was forc'd to change his Habit and his Name—From <hi>Cuningham</hi> to <hi>Boutefeu.</hi> But thinking it not safe to stay here, fled; and in his Journey happen'd into a Viscount's Castle, but the Viscount was gone a Journey. However, this Viscount had a very beautiful Sister, that had the Command in her Brother's Absence; she entertain'd my Master very splendidly: At last he fell in love with her, and she with him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Methinks she was very forward, <hi>Jeffrey.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>She was so indeed, Madam; for before my Master left her, she prov'd with Child.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>How! with Child, and not married, <hi>Jeffrey!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>My Master had promis'd her Marriage, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Oh, the impudent Creature! And thy Master was to blame, not to keep his Word, <hi>Jeffrey.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Not at all, Madam, when you have heard all. You must know, my Master grew jealous of one of the Servants, as indeed he had Reason: And one Day pretended to ride out, and he shou'd not return that Night, but left me to let him in, when the Servants were all a-bed, which I did. Going up to this Lady's Bed-Chamber, and not being expected that Night, found the Servant in Bed with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Unheard of Impudence!</p>
<p>At first I was going to condemn thy Master, for deceiving a young Creature; but 'tis likely he was not the first, that had to do with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="65" facs="65"/>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Very likely so, Madam. Next Day my Master was for packing up his Awls, and for going; she cry'd, and urg'd his stay, and his Vows to marry her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>He had been more to blame to have done that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>In the mean time the Viscount return'd, found his Sister in Tears, wou'd know the Reason, was told all. He swore, if ever he could get hold of him, he'd hang him at his Castle Gate, but my Master was got off safe. What it will come to, it they should ever meet, I know not, but fear the Event.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>A well invented Lye the Rogue has told. <stage>(Aside.</stage> What was this Viscount's Name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>The Viscount <hi>Sans▪Terre,</hi> I think he was call'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>The Viscount <hi>Sans-Terre!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Why, he's in this House.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>What, in this very House?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>In this very House; in the next Room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>My Lord, your Servant. I have a Question to ask of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>What shall I do to make him understand? <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
<p>Humour her in all she says, my Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>Ask what thou wilt, I'll deny thee nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>You had a Sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>I had so. Go on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>And she was unfortunately wrong'd by a base Fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>What must I say next?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="66" facs="66"/>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>'Twas not well done to debauch her, and then to leave her; but Woe be to him, if your Lordship catch him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>If ever I do find the Son of a Whore, I'll hang him at my Castle Gate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>He was very much to blame indeed; but yet, all things consider'd, he was not in all the Blame neither, counting what a Trick she play'd him. He had reason to question, whether the Child was his, or not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>I'm quite at a Loss. Oh! tell me what I must say next? <stage>(Faints into <hi>Jeffrey</hi>'s Arms, who instructs him.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
<p>Take it in your Ear, my Lord. <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Help, <hi>Prudence,</hi> my Lord faints.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pru.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Madam, don't come too near, but give him Air. <stage><hi>(Prudence</hi> and <hi>Jeffrey</hi> tell him what to say.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Oh! he recovers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>Give me a little Air. I beg your Pardon, I never hear my Sister's Wrongs mention'd, but it puts me in Disorder; but if ever I do light upon the Villain, Woe be to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>I'll try to get his Pardon. <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
<p>My Lord, methinks her Crime being the greatest, you might pardon him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>What! Pardon him, that has deflower'd my Sister, got her with Child of a Bastard, and stain'd the Honour of our great Family! No, tho' all the World should plead for him, I'll not forgive it; he dies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Good, my Lord, for my Sake.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>'Tis all in vain, Lady. I'm told he's now in this House, and has chang'd his Name. But if I find him— <stage>(Draws.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Oh hold, my Lord, I must save him. <stage>(Aside.</stage> My Lord, I have but one Request more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>'Twill be in vain: I'll have Revenge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="67" facs="67"/>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Give me this Gentleman's Life, and I am content to be your Wife; otherwise—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a hard Request; but to shew how much I love you, upon that Condition I grant it.</p>
<stage>(Puts up his Sword.</stage>

<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Or, if you think sit, you shall have my Niece <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and with her I'll give you ten thousand Pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Visc.</speaker>
<p>Do you think my Love so poor, that 'twill be brib'd? Nay, then I recal my Promise. He dies this Hour. <stage>(Draws and searches about.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Oh, pray my Lord, forbear; my Lady did it but to try you! See, you fright her.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Well, my Lord, since it must be so, my Chaplain is within, I'm contented he shou'd make us one, make good but your Promise.</p>

<p>Here's fine Doings! But I'll spoil your Sport. What! my House is become a Music-house, is it? But, Gentlewoman, I have something to say to you within.</p>

<p>Then we may have Time to talk more freely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>All is not so safe as you imagine. I fear another Storm before we yet can land. I know not by what means, but the Viscount is discover'd to be a Counterfeit, which I have all along suspected; but whether 'tis come to the Knowledge of my Aunt yet, I know not.</p>

<p>Matter! Why there's Matter enough in hand. We are all undone; the Match is broke off again, and you are like to lose your Mistress. The Widow will not consent you shall marry her Niece; upon which, the Viscount enrag'd, (as indeed he has Cause) is resolv'd to stay no longer.</p>

<p>Ha! What of him? Speak.</p>

<p>After a thousand Arguments, which I us'd to persuade her, she has at last resolv'd—I can't speak it.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. <hi>Cuningham,</hi> our Stars will have it so.</p>

Tis hard indeed to part: But since there is no way left to save your Life, (which more than all the World I prize) but this only, I have at last resolv'd (tho' much against my Will) to give my self to the Viscount.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cun.</speaker>
<p>Oh! do not name it, Madam, the very Thought is worse, than Death.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>I'm sorry we are so near a kin, but that's not the chief Reason; your Vow to marry another, and yet when I consider she was false, and had to do with more, than one, and that the Child might as well not be yours, I think you were in the right to part: So I am content (since my Hopes are lost) that you shou'd marry with my Niece. But believe me, you do not know how much I'm troubled▪ to see another take what I so much desir'd. But we must endeavour to be satisfied.</p>

<p>I heard him bid the Link-boy lead to the Devil Tavern. If you please, thither we'll go, and conclude upon the Matter. A Glass or two of Wine may fetch him about again.</p>

<speaker>Widow.</speaker>
<p>Truly, Mr. <hi>Lovemore,</hi> I'm much oblig'd to you, and shall endeavour to return your friendly Advice. I hope we shall live as loving Neighbours ought, but now we lose time. The Viscount may perhaps be gone, should we stay longer.</p>

<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Lost! Undone for ever!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Ah! Ha! my sweet Lady! Have I caught you at last!</p>
<p>Jeremy! Jeremy!</p>
<p>Where has your sweet Ladyship been, I pray, that you are so afraid of being discover'd? Come, I know you have a Lie in readiness: Let's have it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>No where but just with <hi>Damaris,</hi> to take a little of the fresh Air; that's all, indeed, sweet Husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>To take the fresh Air, quotha!</p>
<p>Ah, I rather believe 'twas to take a Heat, you Witch you.</p>

<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Husband, let the Door be open'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>No: You shall stay there till your Parents come.</p>
<p>I have sent for them: They shall see what Hours you keep. And know of your Gallant you just parted from, your vigorous Lover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dam.</speaker>
<p>Madam, he over-heard all,</p>
<p>And we are undone. <stage>(Aside to her.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>What, have you no Excuse ready?</p>
<p>No Invention? You and your wicked Instrument there, that stands like the Serpent at <hi>Eve</hi>'s Elbow, to tempt her to Sin.</p>
<p>What, is your Prompter to Wickedness dumb?</p>
<p>I'd fain hear how you intend to excuse it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>I don't go about to excuse it, Husband—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>No; That's because you don't know how.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>I do confess, I have been to meet a Gentleman, but not alone; <hi>Damaris</hi> was with me. And sure there was no Crime in a little harmless Chat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>No, no, not in the least; making me a Cuckold is no harm at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Husband, let me in, and I'll never do the like again, as long as I live; but you shall hence-forward find me the most dutiful Wife, that you could wish for. Pray, Husband, trust me but this once.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Do not disgrace me to my Parents, by exposing me at this unseasonable Hour, in which I do confess I am much to blame—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Do you so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Hang them that believes you, I say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>I am sure I never injur'd you in all my Life; but am as innocent as the Child unborn, from doing the Ill, which you suspect.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>It may be so: 'Twas not your Fault then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Pray, dear Husband, believe me, and let me in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>On my Knees I ask your Pardon, do but open the Door.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>If you let me in this time, 'twill work upon me more, than all the Liberty in the World cou'd do beside.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>I care not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Husband, I love you dearly, and love you only: How can you then be so cruel to refuse me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Ah, cunning Crocodile?</p>
<p>Now you are caught, 'tis dear Husband, sweet Husband, 'tis only you I love: But at another time, 'tis good for nothing old Fool. No, no, I know you well enough, and so shall your Parents now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Husband, let the Door be open'd▪</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Try me but this once.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>If you provoke me, I may despair, grow desperate, and do a Deed, which you may repent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Good lack! What will your sweet Ladyship do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>I'll kill my self with this Knife here.</p>

<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Nay, 'twill not be so well as you imagine neither. Every body knows how ill we have liv'd, and when I'm dead, People will think you murder'd me.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Ay!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Therefore I'll kill my self, to have my Death reveng'd upon you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Odd, I'll trust to that.</p>
<p>Besides, killing ones self has been a great while out of fashion. But why don't you dispatch? Methinks you are long about it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt,</speaker>
<p>You may believe me, for I'll certainly do it, if you persist.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Odd, I'll venture it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Besides, when I am dead, my Ghost shall haunt you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Ah, if I cou'd but once get rid of your Person here, I should not fear your Ghost hereafter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Have you no Pity left?</p>
<p>I am just going to do it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>And yet you are long about it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Since nothing but my Death can satisfy you—</p>

<p>Oh, she has don't! She has don't!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Now, <hi>Damaris,</hi> you find too late I did not jest—</p>
<p>I know thou'lt see my Death reveng'd upon my cruel Husband, who has accus'd me falsly; for I affirm with my dying Breath, I never wrong'd him. Farewel!</p>
<p>Death beckons me into a dark and gloomy Vale, where I must follow.</p>

<speaker>Dam.</speaker>
<p>She's gone! She's gone!</p>
<p>Oh, thou worse than Savage! To murder so sweet a Lady, so innocent and so good: Nay, I'll swear you did it. <stage>(Cries over her.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>I hear no Noise! <stage>(Looks frighten'd.</stage> Is't possible the Devil shou'd be so great with her, that she cou'd kill her self to be reveng'd on me!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Now, <hi>Damaris,</hi> stand close in this Corner:</p>
<p>Close, Close. <stage>(They stand aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Brittle</hi> with a Light; they slip by him, go in, and lock the Door: He looks about.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! I thought indeed how well she'd do it: Here's none of her! She made me believe she kill'd her self, and the mean while ran away. Well, e'en let her go; I shall have this Satisfaction, her Parents shall be Witness of her Hours. I'll in, and wait their coming.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Goes to the Door, and finds it lock'd. Knocks.</stage>
<stage>Mrs. <hi>Brittle</hi> and <hi>Damaris</hi> above at the Window, where he was.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Away, you idle Sot; is this a time of Night for an honest Man to come home in?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dam.</speaker>
<p>Go, go, you may be asham'd!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Why, have you the Impudence—</p>
<stage>(Looks up, and sees 'em above.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>How many Nights am I forc'd to sit up to wait for his coming in? And he tells the World, 'tis I am to blame. But now it shall be seen who's to blame, and who not. My Father and Mother are coming, they shall see what Hours you keep—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="81" facs="81"/>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>I confess, I stand amaz'd at this Impudence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>They shall know all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Why, have you the Face to deny—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Go, go, I'll hear none of your impudent Excuses; you are drunk, you Sot, you Swine. But here comes my honourable Father and Mother.</p>
<stage>Enter Sir <hi>Peter</hi> and Lady <hi>Pride.</hi></stage>
<p>I'm glad you are come to be Witness of what I still suffer, by this ungrateful Usage of a cruel Husband. You see what Hours he keeps; every Night at the Tavern roaring with his Companions, whilst I am forc'd to sit at home alone, waiting for his coming; and when he does come, he strait raves and abuses me at such a rate, that I am not able to endure it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Why, was there ever such Impudence!</p>
<p>I wish this Candle were in my Belly, if—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>I know what he'll say now, if you'll believe him; he'll tell you, that I am still in the wrong, and 'tis I that have been out at this late Hour, and as for his part, he has been within all this Evening, and knows nothing of all this Matter, not he: But I'll leave your selves to judge, if this is an Hour for an honest Husband to come home at.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>Why then may I never—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>You see he's so drunk, he can hardly stand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Faugh!—I smell him hither.</p>
<p>He stinks of Liquors and Tobacco like a Tarpaulin, that has not been sober whilst his Twelve-Months Pay wou'd last.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>I tell you, that I am not drunk, nor have I been out of my House.</p>
</sp>

<p>I told you he wou'd deny it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>I say, that 'tis she that has been out just now, and with her Gallant, and therefore I sent for you; and that I have not been out of my Doors.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Do you hear him? But <hi>Damaris</hi> can justify, I have not set my Foot over the Threshold since Day-light.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dam.</speaker>
<p>If she has, never believe me more.</p>
<p>I can assure your Honours 'tis true; for I have not been out of her Company since he went out to the Tavern.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Britt.</speaker>
<p>Therefore I do beseech you, good Father and Mother, to revenge my Cause, for I am not able to endure it any longer: If I do, you'll never see me alive another Week.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Britt.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a strange thing, that she must be believed, and I not.</p>
<p>I tell you—</p>

<p>Faugh! What a Smell there's about him.</p>
<stage>(She goes cross the Stage.</stage>

<p>Well then; I'll stand farther off, if you will but hear me speak. <stage>(Goes backward.</stage> I shall say nothing but the Truth, and what I can prove.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Peter.</hi></speaker>
<p>Again at your Proofs, and your idle Jealousies!</p>
<p>Be dumb, Coxcomb; it were a good deed to break your Head, for sending thus for us out of our Beds, and making Fools of us still. If you ever dare to do the like again, we'll find a Means to handle you—</p>
<p>If there be no Law (but cutting of Throats) to revenge these Affronts—I say no more—But remember you are warn'd.</p>

<p>And is this all his Punishment?</p>

<p>No; Come down, and he shall ask your Pardon. 'Tis the least he can do.</p>
