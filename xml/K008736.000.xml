<p>I am here, Sir.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Well, John, how is my brother after his journey?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>The counsellor gives his compliments to you, sir, and thanks you for your enquiry: He is very well, and will wait on you as soon as he is dressed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Mighty well—what is that you have in your hand, John?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>It is nothing for you, Sir—it is a card for my mistress, from Madam Mulroony; her man gave it me as I came in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Pray, let me see it— "Mrs. Mulroony makes her compliments to Mrs. Murrogh O'Dogherty, and likewise to Mr. Murrogh O'Dogherty, and hopes to have the favour of their company on Sunday the 17th instant, to play at cards, sup, and spend the evening, with Lady Kinnegad, Mrs. Cardmark, Miss Brag, Mr. Mushroom, Cornet Basilisk, Sir Anthony All-Night, Major Gamble, and a very jolly party."—Here, John, take it to your mistress—I have nothing to say to it. <stage>(<hi>Exit</hi> John)</stage>—Well done Mrs. Mulroony—faith, and it well becomes your father's daughter, and your husband's wife, to play at cards upon a Sunday. She is another of the fine ladies of this country, who, like my wife, is sending her soul to the devil, and her husband to a gaol as fast as she can. The booby has scarce a thousand pounds a year in the world, yet he spends above two thousand in equipage, taste, high life, and jolly parties—besides what his fool of a wise loses to that female sharper, my Lady Kinnegad and her jolly party; which, if I may judge by my own wife, is at least a good two thousand more; so that by the rule of subtraction, take four thousand pounds a year out of one, and in a very little time nothing will remain but a goal, or an escape in the packet on Connaught Monday.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Counsellor, you are welcome to Dublin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Brother, I am extremely glad to see you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>By my faith, and so am I you. Odzooks give us a kiss, man: I give you my honour I am as glad to see you in Dublin at this juncture, as I should to see a hundred head of fat bullocks upon my own land, all ready for Ballinasloe Fair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Sir, your humble servant. That is a great compliment from you, brother, I know.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>It is a very true one I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Well, I see by the news-papers that my sister is returned from her coronation frolie, and in health I suppose, or you would have wrote me word had it been otherwise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, she is in health indeed, and returned with a vengeance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Pray what is the matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Ogho! enough is the matter, the devil an inhabitant in Swift's Hospital for Lunatics, is in a worse pickle than she is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>You surprise me!—in what respect, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Why, with a distemper that she has brought over with her from England, which will, in a little time, I am afraid, infect the whole nation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Pray, what may that be?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="7"/>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Sir, it is called the Irish Fine Lady's delirium, or the London vertigo; if you were to hear her when the sit is upon her—oh, she is as mad—the devil a thing in this poor country but what gives her the spleen, and the vapours—then such a phrenzy of admiration for every thing in England—and, among the rest of her madness, she has brought over a new language with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean by a new language?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Why a new kind of a London English, that's no more like our Irish English, than a coxcomb' fine gilded chariot like a Glassmanogue noddy.—Why what name do you think she went by when she was in England?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Why, what name dare she go by but Dogherty?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Dogherty!—ogho—upon my honour she startles when she hears the name of Dogherty, and blushes, and is as much ashamed as if a man had spoke bawdy to her.—No, no, my dear, she is no longer the plain, modest, good-natured, domestic, obedient Irish Mrs. O'Dogherty, but the travelled, rampant, high-lis'd, prancing English Mrs. Diggerty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Mrs. Diggerty! ridiculous!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ridiculous indeed! to change her name—was there ever such impertinence? But do you know, brother, among the rest of your sister's whims and madnesses, that she is turned a great politician too concerning my name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! a politician I—Why how in the name of wonder and common sense can
<pb n="9" facs="8"/>
politics and the name of Dogherty be connected?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O it's a wonder indeed!—but strange as it is, they are connected—but very ridiculously as you may imagine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>But, prithee, by what means?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Why, you must know, we are to have an election shortly for the county that I live in, which young Lord Turnabout wants to carry for one of his own gang; and as the election in a great measure depends upon my interest, the young fox, knowing the conceit and vanity of my wife, has taken her by her favourite soible, and tickled it up, by telling her that if I direct my interest properly, it would not be difficult to procure me a title. Now, sir, this piece of flattery has stirred up such a rage of quality and title in her giddy head, that I cannot rest night or day for her importunity—in short, she would have me desert my friends, and sell myself, my honour, and my country, as several others have done before me, merely for a title, only that she may take place of a parcel of foolish idle women, and sink the antient name of Dogherty in the upstart title of Lady Thingum, my Lady Fiddle F addle, or some such ridiculous nonsense.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>But, sir, pray pause a little upon this business—my sister's vanity, I grant you, may be ridiculous—but though you despise titles and oftentation, yet, as your interest can certainly make the member, were I in your circumstances, I would have a voice in the senate of my
<pb n="10" facs="9"/>
country—go into parliament for the county yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Ogh, I have been among them already, and I know them all very well. What signifies my sitting among hundreds of people with my single opinion all alone. When I was there before I was stigmatized as a singular blockhead, an impracticable fellow, only because I would not consent to sit like an image, and when the master of the puppets pulled the string of my jaw on one side, to say aye, and on t'other side, to say no, and to leap over a stick backwards and forwards, just as the faction of party and jobbers, and leaders, and political adventurers directed—ah, brother, brother, I have done with them all—oh, I have done with them all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>What, and after all your expence of opposing government right or wrong, and supporting your patriots, will you give them all up?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Indeed I will—I was patriot mad I own, like a great many other fools in this distracted country—sir, I was so mad that I hated the very name of a courtier as much as an illiterate lay-swaddling methodist does that of a regular clergyman. But I am cured of that folly; for now I find that a courtier is just as honest a man as a patriot—my dear, they are both made of the same stuff; ah, I have at last found out what sort of an animal a patriot is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Ay!—and pray, brother, what sort of an animal is he?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Why he is a sort of a political weathercock, that is blown about by every wind of society, which the foolish people are always
<pb n="11" facs="10"/>
looking up at, and staring, and distracting themselves with the integrity of its vicissitudes—to-day it is blown by the rough, rattling, tempest of party; next day by the trade-wind of fly, subtle, veering faction; then by the headlong hurricane of the people's hot foggy breath; huzza boys, down with the courtier, up with the patriot, 'till at last the smooth, soft, gentle warm breeze of interest blows upon it, and from that moment it rusts to a point, and never stirs after—so there is your puff patriot for you—ogh, to the devil I pitch them all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! I am glad to find, brother, that you are come to that way of thinking at last, and I wish you had had the same notions years ago, it would have saved you many thousands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, and that it would—however experience is an excellent tutor, and as you are a young man, and just coming into the world, mine may be of some service to you; take this judgment from me then, and remember that an honest quiet country gentleman who out of policy and humanity establishes manufactories, or that contrives employment for the idle and the industrious, or that makes but a blade of corn grow where there was none before, is of more use to this poor country than all the courtiers, and patriots, and politicians, and prodigals that are unhanged;—so there let us leave them and return to my wife's business.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart, I long to have a particular account of her conduct.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="11"/>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O, brother, I have many grievances to tell you of, but I have one that's more whimsical than all the rest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Pray what is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Why you must know, brother, I am going to be a cuckold as fast as I can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! that's a comical grievance indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O stay 'till you hear the story, and I'll engage you will say it is as comical a cuckoldom as ever was contrived.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>I am glad to find, sir, it is of so sacetious a nature—pray let me hear this business?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Sit down then, brother, for I have got a little touch of my gout, let us sit down for a moment, and I will let you into the whole affair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Pray do, sir, for you have really raised my curiosity.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(sits.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>You must know, brother, there is an English coxcomb in this town just arrived among us, who thinks every woman that sees him is in love with him, and this spark, like another Paris of Troy, has taken it into his head to make a Helen of my wife, and a poor cuckoldy Menelaus of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Pray who is the spark?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Why the name of this cuckoldmaker is Mushroom, but from his conceit and impertinence, the women and jokers of this town have dignified him with the title of Count Mushroom. Sir, he is the son of a pawn-broker in London, who having a mind to make a gentleman of his son, sent him to the university
<pb n="13" facs="12"/>
of Oxford; where, by mixing in the follies and vices of irregular youth, he got into a most sanguine friendship with young Lord Old-Castle, who you know has a large estate in this country, and of whose ancestors mine have held long and profitable leases, which are now near expiring—in short, sir, this same Count Mushroom and my Lord became the Pylades and Orestes of the age, and so very fond was my Lord of him, that out of sheer friendship to the Count, he got his sister with child.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! that was friendly indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O yes, it was what you may call modern friendship, taste, and bun tun; and my Lord being a man of gratitude, in return made him his agent in this country, and sent him over to settle his affairs here. And the Count and I being in treaty to renew the leases with my Lord, and we not being able to agree upon the terms, the coxcomb sends my wife a warm billedoux, in which he very gallantly tells her, that she shall decide the difference between us, and settle the leases at her own price, only upon the trifling condition that he may be permitted now and then to be the occasional lord of her ladyship's matrimonial manor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Impudent rascal! And, pray, what says my sister to all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Why she does not know a word of the matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>No! pray how came you to be acquainted with his letter then, and his designs upon my sister?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="13"/>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Why there is the joke: it was by the help of Katty Farrel, my wife's woman, by whose assistance I carry on a correspondence with the fellow in my wife's name, unknown to her; and by that means I shall not only detect and expose the fellow, but get an excellent bargain of the leases, which are to be signed this very day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>But, sir, I hope you wont accept of leases upon those terms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O, I have no time to moralize with you on that point, but depend upon it I will convince you before I sleep of the propriety of my taking the leases: Lord, what signifies it; it is only a good bargain got from a foolish lord by the ingenuity of a knavish agent, which is what happens every day in this country, and in every country indeed.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> John.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>Sir, Mr. Mushroom and Mr. Sharp the attorney are below.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O, they are come about the leases. I will wait on them, John.</p>
<stage>[<hi>Exit</hi> John.</stage>
<p>Now, brother, you shall see one of the pertest and most conceited impudent coxcombs that has ever yet been imported into this land, or that disgraced humanity.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Mushroom <hi>without.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>My compliments, Mrs. Katty, to your lady, I will be with her in the twinkling of a
<pb n="15" facs="14"/>
star, or in less time than a single glance of her own immortal beauty can pass to the centre of an amorous heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Orra now did you ever hear such cursed nonsense.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mushroom.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>My dear Diggerty, I kiss your hands. I am come on purpose—I beg ten thousand pardons—I understood you were alone—you are busy I presume.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Count, we are not. This gentleman is a relation—my wife's brother—counsellor Hamilton, whom you have so often heard me talk of, and with whom I desire you will be acquainted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I feel a superlative happiness in being known to you, I have long expected and long wished for it with a lover's appetite; therefore without waiting for the dull avocation of experience, or the pedantic forms of ceremony, I beg you will honour me with a niche in your esteem, and register me in the select catalogue of your most constant and most ardent friends and admirers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>O dear sir, you are superabundantly obliging—this is such a favour—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>No, no, no—none, none—give me your hand, Hamilton, you are my friend Diggerty's friend, and that's enough—I'll serve you—say no more—I'll serve you—rely upon me—I live in this town quite en famille—I go about every where, am of no party but those of love,
<pb n="16" facs="15"/>
pleasure and gallantry—the women like and command me at cards, tea, scandal and dancing—the men, at wit, hazard, jolly parties, a late hour and a bottle—I love ease, hate ceremony, and am at home wherever I go—that's my system, Hamilton—ha, is not that taste, life, philosophy, and summum bonum—ha, my dear, at home wherever I go, an't I, Diggerty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O, indeed, to give you your due, Count, you are never bashful in any place.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Never, never, my dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>No faith, nor none of your family I believe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! never, never, my dear Diggerty—bashfulness is a mark of ignorance, an uncourtly, vulgar disease—what we men of the world are never infected with—but, my dear Diggerty, I am come on purpose to settle with you; my attorney with the leases is below, for as I know my lord would be loth to lose you as a tenant, and as I am convinced it would be for his interest you should have the lands, why we will even sign and seal at once upon your own terms—for really I think tenants in Ireland want encouragement—they are rack'd too high—they are indeed—it is a shame they should be rack'd so high.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Faith, Count, there's many a true word poke in jest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Upon my honour I am serious—you want encouragement in trade too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>But do you really think so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="17" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>I do upon my honour, and I will speak to some people of consequence about it on the other side, as soon as I return.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Orra but will you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>I will upon my honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O aye, you politicians promise us the devil and all while you are among us, but the moment you get o't'other side, you have devilish bad memories.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>You seem to like Ireland, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>O immensely, sir—it is a damn'd fine country, sir — and excellent claret — excellent claret upon my honour! 'tis true indeed it is not such claret as we drink in London—however, upon the whole, it's a pretty, neat, light, soft, silky, palateable wine, and I like it mightily—but your fish in this here country is horrid. There you want taste, Hamilton—that there is an article of the scavoir vivre, in which you are totally ignorant—quite barbarous—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Aye! in what respect, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Oh, my dear Hamilton, how can you ask such a question—you, you, now—who have been in London!—why you eat all your fish here too noo—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Too noo?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Yes, all too noo—why you eat it the very day—nay, sometimes the very hour it comes out of the water—now that there is a total want of taste—quite barbarous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O yes, brother, we eat all our fish in this here country too noo—too noo a great deal. Now, I fancy, Count, we should keep
<pb n="18" facs="17"/>
our fish before we dress it, as you keep your venison, till it has got the hot gout.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!—the hot gout—ha, ha, ha!—Oh, I shall expire—my dear Diggerty, I honour your hot gout—but your French is a little en Irlandois—en Provence—haut gout is the word.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes—I understand you—Fogo.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!—Hamilton, you are a little odd in this here country in some points—your friend there—is—you understand me—however upon the whole, take you altogether, you are a damn'd honest, tory rory, rantum scantum, dancing, singing, laughing, boozing, jolly, friendly, fighting, hospitable people, and I like you mightily.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Omnes.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word, sir, the people of Ireland are much obliged to you for your helter skelter, rantum scantum portrait of them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Indeed and that we are; and so you like us mightily?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>I do upon honour, and I believe I shall marry one of your women here, grow domestic, and settle among you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Orra but will you do us that honour?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>I really intend it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Faith then you will be a great honour to us, and you will find a great many relations here, Count; for we have a large crop of the Mushrooms in this here country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>O, sir, I don't doubt it, for we are a numerous family both in England and Ireland—
<pb n="19" facs="18"/>
but I beg pardon, my dear Diggerty, I must rob you of my company for a moment to pay my devoirs to your lady; I know she is impatient to see me upon a particular affair—I will return upon the wings of diligence, then sign, squeeze wax, and dedicate to wit, mirth, and convivial jollity—Hamilton, yours, yours—my dear Diggerty, give me thy hand—from this moment set me down as thy unalterable friend—for I intend to be well with thy wife this very evening.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Katty.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir—but she has had a sad misfortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>What is that, Katty?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Katty.</speaker>
<p>The money, sir, that you gave her to pay the mercer's bill, from Covent-Garden, that was sent after her, she lost last night to my Lady Kinnegad, and some more of them, at bragg—but do not take any notice that I have
<pb n="20" facs="19"/>
told you of it, for she intends to borrow as much from Mr. Mushroom for a day or two as will pay the bill.</p>

</sp>
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>

<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Katty, that must not be. She must not do so mean a thing upon any account, as to borrow money of Mushroom. I will let you have the money to pay the bill, and do you say you borrowed it of your brother, or some friend or other, for her.</p>

<p>Welcome from England, sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>I am imminsely obligated to you, brother.</p>
</sp>

<p>I hope it answered your expectation, sister.</p>

<p>I am glad it pleased you.</p>

<sp>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Beyond all degrees of compirison.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="21" facs="20"/>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O yes—beyond all degrees of compirison.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Veest! imminse! extatic! I never knew life before—every thing there is high, tip top, the grand monde, the bun tun—and quite teesty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O yes, every thing there is quite teesty, brother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Well, Count, do you know that you pleased me veestly last night; I never saw you in such high humour—brother, I believe you do not know Mr. Mushroom, an English gentleman; pray let me have the honour of introducing him to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>I have had that honour already, sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Yes, madam, Hamilton and I are old acquaintance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O yes they are old acquaintance, they have known each other above these two minutes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Pray how do you like London, sister?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>O the place of the world, brother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Then Dublin I suppose—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>O, dear brother, don't neem them together.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O no, you must not neem them together.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Upon my honour, Dublin, after seeing London, looks like Irish-Town or Ring's-End: Oh, every thing I set my eyes on here gives me the ennui, and the countre cure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O yes, every thing here gives her the contre coeur; that is a disease she has brought
<pb n="22" facs="21"/>
over with her from London that we know nothing of here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>The streets are so narrow, the houses so dirty, and the people so ridiculous! then the women, Count! ha, ha, ha!—I can't help laughing when I think of them. Well, I am convinced that the women of this here country who have never travelled, have nothing of that—a—a—non-chalance, and that jenny-see-quee that we have in London.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O no, brother! the women have nothing of that jenny-see-quee, that she has brought over with her from London.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>But, Mushroom—I don't know if what I am going to tell you be conceit or real; but, upon my honour, when I first came from England—you must know, brother, I came over in the picket.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O yes, brother, she came over in the picket.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir, I came over in the picket, and we had a great orage—I don't believe, Mr. Diggerty, you know what an orage is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Indeed you may take your oath I don't, my dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>That is, sir, becase you have not been in foreign parts—then I will tell you what an orage is—sir, an orage is a storum.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I thank you for your intelligence—indeed you are very learned and very obliging.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>And so, as I was saying, Count, we had a great storum, and the picket—I shall never forget it—the picket landed us about
<pb n="23" facs="22"/>
twenty miles from Dublin—and so, do you know, I say, Mushroom, that I fancied, being just come from England, that the very dogs here when they barked, had the brogue, ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Omnes.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Why then, by all that's gothic, madam, I have thought so a thousand times.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>You have!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>I have, upon honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Have you ever observed it, brother? Mr. Diggerty, what do you think? Hav'n't the dogs of this here country the brogue?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Indeed and that they have, my dear, and the cows too, and the sheep, and the bullocks, and that as strong as ever your own mother had it, who was an O'Gallagher.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Oh!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>G'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Not two of whose ancestors could ever speak three words of English to be understood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>You are a strange rude man, Mr. Diggerty, to tell me of my mother's family—you know I always despised my mother's family—I hate the very name of Gallagher, and all the old Irish whatever.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>The present company excepted, sister—your husband, you know—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>O, I never think of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Ha, that's polite indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O no, she never thinks of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Well, but sister, you have given us no account of the coronation, no doubt you were there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="24" facs="23"/>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>There! O Moundew!—What a quistion! Why I was in every part of it—ax Mushroom else.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Every where, every where—she was every where, and with every body.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O' Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Well, well—then I suppose it was very fine; but after all now, was it as fine as our riding the fringes here, or the lord lieutenant going to the parliament house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>He, he, he! O shocking! don't neem them together—now that is so Irish—but, brother, what would have afforded you the highest entertainment, was the city feast. O that there was imminse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O' Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O yes, that there was imminse, brother, and much finer than this here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Then you were at the city feast too, sister?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>O dear, yes! the court never stirred without me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>No, indeed, the court never stirred without her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>And the lord mayor made a point of having me there: so I went with her Grace, a friend of mine, and a party of the court, as one of the houshold—but the minute I went in every eye was upon me: Lord, it was veestly pleasant to see how the she grocers, the she mercers, the she dyers, the she hosiers, and the she taylors did stare at me—I was very brilliant that's certain—rather more so than I was at the wedding.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O indeed I don't doubt but you were a sight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="25" facs="24"/>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>O pray, Mr. Diggerty, be quiet, and don't interrupt me.—Well, but, brother, as I was saying, it was imminsely entertaining to hear the awkward city creatures whisper and give their vardee upon me, in their city manner—Lord, is this the handsome Irish woman?—the famous Irish toast? the celebrated Mrs. Diggerty—ha!—I don't think she is so handsome, says one—hum!—well enough, says another, only I don't like her nose—pray, doesn't she squint? says a third—O yes, she certainly squints, says a fourth—and she is a little crooked—but she is genteel—O yes, yes, the city creatures all allowed I was genteel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O yes, yes, to be sure they all allowed she was genteel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>But, brother—O Lud! I had like to have forgot—do you know that the Count is one of the prettiest poets in England, aye, or in Ireland either.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>O heavens! madam!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>He is, by my honour.</p>

<p>I do not doubt the gentleman's talents in the least, sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Sir, you are very polite, the lady is pleas'd to rally, that's all, for my muse is but a smatterer—a slattern—a meer slip-shod lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Do not mind him, brother, what I say is true. He is a mighty pretty poet, and to convince you that he is, I will shew you some verses that he indited upon me, as I was dancing at court—<stage>(Pulls them out).</stage>—Here they are, brother: Count, will you be so obliging as to read them to my brother?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>WELL, but, my dear, why will you be in such a passion? Why will you not hearken to reason?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Diggerty, I will hear no reason; there can be no reason against what I say—you are the strangest man—not be a lord—sir, I insist upon it—there's a necessity for a peerage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O! then only shew me the necessity, and all my objections will vanish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, I am affronted for want of a title: a parcel of upstarts, with their crownets upon their coaches, their chairs, their spoons, their handkerchiefs—nay, on the very knockers of their doors—creatures that were below me but t'other day, are now truly my superiors, and have the precedency, and are set above me at table.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Set above you at table?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir, set above me at table wherever I go.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Upon my honour then that's a great shame. Well, well, my dear—come, come, my dear, don't be in such a fluster.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Fluster! why sir, I tell you I am ready to expire when ever I go into the great world.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="29"/>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>At what, my dear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>At what—Egh! how can you ax such an ignorant quistion? Can there be any thing more provoking to a woman of my teest and spirit, than to hear the titles of a parcel of upstart ugly creatures bawled in one's ears upon every occasion—my Lady Kinnegad's coach there—my Lady Kilgobbin's chair there—my Lady Casteknock's servants there—my Lady Tanderagee's chariot there. And after all these titles only consider how my vile neem founds—
<stage>(cries)</stage>
Mrs. Diggerty's servants there—Mrs. Diggerty's chair there—Mrs. Diggerty's coach there—it is so mean and beggarly I cannot bear it—the very thought of it makes me ready to burst my stays, and almost throws me into my hysterics.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(throws herself into a couch.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Nay, my dear, don't be working yourself up to your sits, your hysterics, and your tantrums now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>My life is miserable <stage>(rises)</stage>. You cross me in every thing, you are always finding fault with my routs, and my drums, and my fancy ball—t'other night you would not make up a dress for it, nor appear at it—O fie, fie, fie—but you are true Irish to the very bone of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Indeed I am, and to the marrow within the bone too; and what is more, I hope I shall never be otherwise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Ridiculous weakness! Pray, sir, do not you think, the English love their country as well as the Irish do theirs?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="30"/>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O indeed I believe they do, and a great deal better; though we have a great many among us that call themselves patriots and champions, who, at the same time, would not care if poor old Ireland was squeezed as you squeeze an orange—provided they had but their share of the juice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Pooh, pooh! nobody minds what you say—you are always abusing every body in power—well, sir, you see the English are improving in teest every day, and have their burlettas and their operas, their Cornelys, their Almacks, their macaronies—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O my dear, I tell you again and again, that the English can never be precedent to us. They, by their genius and constitution, must always run mad about something or other, either about burlettas, pantomimes, a man in a bottle, a Cock-lane ghost, or something of equal importance. But, my dear, they can afford to run mad after such nonsense; why they owe more money than we are worth; stay 'till we are as rich as they are, and then we may be allowed to run mad after absurdities as well as they.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Mighty well, sir, mighty well! Oh mighty well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Heyday, what's the matter now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>But I see your design—you have a mind to break my heart— <stage>(sobs and cries)</stage>—yes, you argue and contradict me for no other end—you do every thing to fret and vex me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Pray explain, my dear? What is it you mean?</p>

<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, ever since I returned to this odious country I have been requesting and begging, and praying, that you would send to London only for the set of long-tailed horses, that I told you I admired so—but no, I cannot prevail, though you know my Lady Kilgobbin, my Lady Balruddery, my Lady Castleknock, and, in short, every lady of figure all run upon long tails—nobody but doctors, apothecaries, lawyers, cits, and country squires drive with short tails now—for my part, you know I detest a short tail.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Well, my dear, I have sent for your brother to town, on purpose to settle all these points between us, and if he thinks it proper that you should have long tails, you may have them as long as my Lady Kilgobbin's, my Lady Balruddery's tails, or any tails in the universe; and as to the title, if it can be had, why we will submit that to him likewise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>I know it can be had—and so let me have no more trouble about it, for a title I will have—I must be a lady as well as other people—I can't bear being a plain Mrs. Diggerty any longer.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(<hi>cries.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh</speaker>
<p>Well, well, my dear, we will try what we can do—you must be a lady! yes, yes, you shall be a lady; but by the blood of the O'Doghertys, it shall be a broken-back'd lady. A hump shall be your patent, my dear.</p>

<p>At the Curragh, my dear, with Pat Wildsire, Sir Anthony All-Night, Sir Toby Ruin, Dick Bashaw, and half a score more, and a fine chase we had—haux, haux, my honies—over, over, haux—but I was resolved to be with you, my little Diggerty, because I promised, so I smoaked it away to town—drove myself in my own Phaeton, and was over-turned just as I came to dirty Dublin.</p>

<p>Was there ever so, rude, so abrupt a behaviour—to force me from my company thus.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Tis what your insolent disease demands; the suddenness and abruptness of the
<pb n="41" facs="40"/>
shock is the chief ingredient in the remedy that must cure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>I will tell you, madam—you are not ignorant that your husband took you without a fortune; that he generously gave the little our father left you to your younger sister, with the benevolent addition of two thousand pounds—you know too, that by marriage articles, upon a separation or your husband's death, you are entitled only to a hundred pounds a year; which cautious pittance his prudence wisely insisted on, as a necessary check upon the conduct of giddy, female youth, and thoughtless vanity, when matched with the tempered age of sobriety and discretion—now, madam, I am commissioned to inform you, that the doors are open, and that the stipulated sum will be punctually paid you, as your vicious appetite shall demand; for know, that neither your husband's love, my affection, nor a residence in this house can be enjoyed by you another hour, but on the hard condition of a thorough reformation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>I will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Sit down—know then, in your husband's judgment, the sums you have squandered, and those you have been cheated of by your female friends, is your least offence—it is your pride, your midnight revels, insolence of taste, rage of precedency, that grieve him; for they have made you the ridicule of every flirt and coxcomb, and the scorn and pity of every sober person that knows your folly; this reflects disgrace upon your friends, contempt upon the spirit and credit of your husband, and has furnished whispering suspicion with stories and implications, which have secretly fixed an infectious stain upon your chastity.</p>

<p>I care not what slander says—I will rely upon my innocence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>But I will not, madam, nor shall you—it is not sufficient for my sister, your husband's wife, or female reputation, to rely on innocence alone—women must not only be innocent, they must appear so too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Brother, I don't know what you mean by all this. I beg you will explain.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Softly! hear the whole! the maid, instead of carrying the letter to you, delivers that, and many others, to her master, who, in your name, hand, stile, and sentiment, has answered them all, and carried on an amorous correspondence with the gentleman, even up to an assignation; and, now, at this very instant, the spark is preparing for the happy interview, and has made the town the confidants of his good fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>O heavens!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coun.</speaker>
<p>Now judge what your husband, brother, and your friends must feel, and what the world must think of her, whose conduct could entitle a coxcomb to such liberties.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Brother, I shall make no defence—the story shocks me! and though I know my own intentions, yet what people may say—but, be assured, I shall be more prudent for the future—perhaps I have been to blame—pray
<pb n="44" facs="43"/>
advise me—only say what I shall do to be revenged upon the fellow for his impudence, and what will convince my husband, you, and all the world of my innocence, and I will do it. I protest you have given such a motion to my heart, and such a trouble and a trembling, as it never felt before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Why, then, the first thing that I ask, is, that you will send away that French rascal the cook, with his compots and combobs, his alamodes and aladobes, his crapandoes and frigandoes, and a thousand outlandish kickshaws, that I am sure were never designed for Christian food; and let the good rough rumps of beef, the jolly surloins, the geefe and turkies, cram fowls, bacon and greens; and the pies, puddings and pasties, that used to be perfectly shoving one another off of the table, so that there was not room for the people's plates; with a fine large cod too, as big as a young alderman—I say, let all those French kickshaws be banished from my table, and these good old Irish dishes
<pb n="46" facs="45"/>
be put in their places; and then the poor every day will have something to eat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>They shall, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>And as to yourself, my dear Nancy, I hope I shall never have any more of your London English; none of your this here's, your that there's, your winegars, your weals, your vindors, your toastesses, and your stone postesses; but let me have our own good plain, old Irish English, which I insist upon is better than all the English English that ever coquets and coxcombs brought into the land.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>I will get rid of these as fast as possible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>And pray, above all things, never call me Mr. Diggerty—my name is Murrogh O'Dogherty, and I am not ashamed of it; but that damn'd name Diggerty always vexes me whenever I hear it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Dig.</speaker>
<p>Then, upon my honour, Mr. O'Dogherty, it shall never vix you again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Ogh, that's right, Nancy—O'Dogherty for ever—O'Dogherty!—there's a found for you—why they have not such a name in all England as O'Dogherty—nor as any of our fine sounding Milesian names—what are your Jones and your Stones, your Rice and your Price, your Heads and your Foots, and Hands and your Wills, and Hills and Mills, and Sands, and a parcel of little pimping names that a man would not pick out of the street, compared to the O'Donovans, O'Callaghans, O'Sullivans, O'Brallaghans, O'Shaghnesses, O'Flahertys, O'Gallaghers, and O'Doghertys,
<pb n="47" facs="46"/>
—Ogh, they have courage in the very sound of them, for they come out of the mouth like a storm; and are as old and as stout as the oak at the bottom of the bog of Allen, which was there before the flood—and though they have been dispossessed by upstarts and foreigners, buddoughs and sassanoughs, yet I hope they will flourish in the Island of Saints, while grass grows or water runs.</p>

<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Oh, a great deal, my dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>I am mighty glad of it, my soul. But now, my dear, I have long wanted to have a little serious conversation with you upon a business that has given me the utmost uneasiness, nay indeed the utmost torture of mind; so without farther ceremony, and in one word, to come to the point—I am jealous, my dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>How! jealous!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Indeed I am, as are half the husbands of this town, and all occasioned by one man, which is that coxcomb, Count Mushroom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>He is a very great coxcomb, I own, my dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>You may say that with a safe conscience—and a great jackanapes he is too into the bargain; though, I must own, the fellow has something genteel in him notwithstanding.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>O yes, my dear, he is a very pretty fellow—that all the world allows.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>It is very true, but his prettiness will be his ruin; for as he makes it his business and his glory to win the affections of women, wherever he goes, and as he has made conquests of several married women in this town, there are half a dozen husbands of us that have agreed to poison him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>How! poison him! O horrid! why that will be murder, my dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>O that is none of our business—let him look to that—we must leave that to the law—the fellow is always following you to the play-house, balls, and routs, and is constantly smiling at you, and ogling, and sighing—but
<pb n="54" facs="53"/>
if ever I catch him at those tricks again, as sure as his name is Mushroom, I will put the lining of this little pistol into the very middle of his scull.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Oh, oh, oh!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>He told me this morning that he had a new intrigue upon his hands this afternoon—I wish I knew where it was; by all that's honourable, I would help the husband to put eight or ten inches of cold iron into the rascal's bowels.</p>

<p>Aye, so it is, my soul. But, my dear, I begin to be a little better; pray send the maid hither.</p>

<p>Very well, my dear, I'll send her to you. I think we have the Count of the three blue balls in a fine pickle; but I have not done with him yet.

<p>Aye, now you are right, Count—the intrigue was but in jest on my wife's side, indeed—here, ladies, come hither, and see this
<pb n="59" facs="58"/>
hero of intrigue and taste that they all admire so much.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mujh.</speaker>
<p>Ah, dear Diggerty, don't expose me.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter the Company.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Omnes.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Here, John—set him upon his legs on the ground—so—there—Lady Kinnegad, pray let me introduce you to the knight of the leathern portmantle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Kin.</speaker>
<p>Count, your most obedient—I would salute you, but I am coarse and stink of sweets.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my dear Lady, that was only the wanton vanity of a coxcomb upon the verge of paradise as he thought.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Jolly.</speaker>
<p>Your humble servant, Count—I would strive to extricate you, but, you know, I am an idiot, a fool—ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>O dear Mrs. Jolly—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Bab.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and I am like an old house newly painted and white-washed, and I stink of rappee. I think a little rappee would not be amiss to clear your eyes, and refresh your spirits, and there is some for you.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Throws snuff in his face.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>O dear Lady Bab, this is <stage>(sneezes)</stage> cruel—<stage>(sneezes)</stage> indelicate—<stage>(sneezes)</stage> and intolerable—<stage>(sneezes)</stage> but I beg you will let me out of this consinement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Indeed I will not, for I intend that other people shall enjoy your situation as well as I—this is Lady High-Life's night—all the world is there—so here, John, take this portmantle
<pb n="60" facs="59"/>
on your shoulders to Lady High-Life's, with my compliments, and never stop till you take it up stairs to the ball-room, and there set it down—they will be extremely glad to see their old friend, the Count of the three blue balls.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Diggerty—madam—ladies—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Omnes.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! away with him—away with him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mush.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Diggerty, you shall answer for this.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Omnes.</speaker>
<p>Away with him—away with him. Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<stage>[He is carried off.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Dogh.</speaker>
<p>Now, gentlemen and ladies, you may go plunder one another at cards and dice as fast as you can—and, like the Count, make yourselves objects for a farce.—If every fine lady and coxcomb in this town were turned into a farce, faith we should be the merriest people in all Europe—but ours is over for to-night, and pretty well upon the whole.</p>
<p>Indeed, I think 'tis very fairly ended: The coxcomb's punish'd; The fine Irish lady's mended.</p>
