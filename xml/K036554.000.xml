<p>THE Countess of Salisbury.</p>
<p>A TRAGEDY.</p>
<p>As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN THE HAY-MARKET.</p>

<head>TO ELIZABETH, COUNTESS OF MOIRA.</head>
<opener><salute>MADAM,</salute></opener>
<p>THE attention you have vouchsafed to the Countess of Salisbury and the Author, ever since they have had the honour of being known to your Ladyship, persuades me that you will take pleasure in hearing it has been favourably received on the English Theatre. Stript now of all stage decoration, and the assistance which it has hitherto received from the most animated performance, it is to undergo a stricter scrutiny, that of the closet; a scrutiny for which it is indeed but little provided. I know your Ladyship will make a tender allowance for want of experience in the Author, and such errors as are incident to human inperfection; but this is an indulgence, which I doubt the critic will not so readily shew him. But however he may censure, I must ever think myself happy in having already acquired your Ladyship's good opinions. I am also flattered, as often as I think of the near resemblance my Heroine has of your Ladyship. Had I been earlier honoured with your Ladyship's acquaintance, I think I could have much enlarged the
<pb n="iv" facs="3"/>
character. And yet there are many virtues, many delicacies, which it would have been impossible for me to have preserved in the picture, of which those only can be truly sensible, who have the happiness of being acquainted with the Original.</p>
<p>Please, Madam, to accept the following attempt, as an offering of my gratitude for many favours; an imperfect indeed, but honest proof, of the esteem, which is due from,</p>
<closer><salute>MADAM,</salute> <signed>Your LADYSHIP's
Most respectful, Most obliged, Humble Servant,
H. HARTSON.</signed></closer>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THE COUNTESS OF SALISBURY made her appearance about two years ago in Ireland, where she was received with very singular marks of favour; the Author there had many friends, and with all the partiality they might be supposed to have for him, those friends did not hesitate to declare, that the excellent performance of Mrs. Dancer and Mr. Barry, contributed largely to the success of the Piece: written in his early youth, without having much knowledge of the stage, or dramatic performances, the Author is sensible what his Tragedy must be, notwithstanding the smiles with which it has been indulged. England, agreeable to the character of good nature and generosity which it has established through all the world, has kindly followed the example of its sister nation, and received with an indulgence the attempt of a young Writer, who is indeed ambitious of pleasing, but dare not aspire to excellence. He attributes, in great measure, his good fortune now, to what his friends attributed it before, the animated performance of Mrs. Dancer and Mr. Barry: it is theirs to endeavour to support a reputation already gained, his to aim at improvement, in order to acquire one.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE, SPOKEN BY Mr. WESTON, in the CHARACTER of a TEAGUE.</head>
<l>MY jewels, I'm come to spake in the behalf—</l>
<l>Hoot, Devil burn you all, you makes me laugh,</l>
<l>Upon my soul now I don't take it well in you:</l>
<l>Arra, be easy, till I'm after telling you:</l>
<l>Smit with the love of glory and of pelf,</l>
<l>To night, a bard from Dublin its ownself,</l>
<l>Has brought a play here for your approbation,</l>
<l>A very pretty thing by my salvation—</l>
<l>If you'll trust Irish evidence I mean—</l>
<l>I can't the story very well explain;</l>
<l>But it's about a Countess and an Earl,</l>
<l>The Countess is a mighty honest girl;</l>
<l>But there's a villain with a damn'd cramp'd name,</l>
<l>Makes such proposhals—'tis a burning shame—</l>
<l>Another too—a Knight—bekeys as why—</l>
<l>But hould you know, you'll see it by and by,</l>
<l>And then 'tis time enough to tell the plot.</l>
<l>O, but that's true, I'd like to have forgot,</l>
<l>The dresses—'Pon my conscience in my days</l>
<l>I never saw their peer, they're all a blaze.</l>
<l>Then there's a child, the sweetest little rogue—</l>
<l>Only excuse a trifling spice of brogue—</l>
<l>He'll make you cry your eyes out, I'll be bound—</l>
<l>'Tis Ireland is the true poetic ground.</l>
<l>The Muses—Phoebus, heath'nish cant I loath!</l>
<l>What's Mount Parnassus to the Hill of Howth?</l>
<l>Or all the scenes each foolish poet paints—</l>
<l>O bub bub-boo! give me the Isle of Saints.</l>
<l>Turn up your noses, cavil now and carp—</l>
<l>Musha, I'm sure our emblem is the harp.</l>
<l>But stop, the bell rings. Fait they'll soon begin;</l>
<l>'Tis time for me to be a going in.</l>
<l>I take my lave then—but dear craters mind—</l>
<l>Pray to our Irish poetry be kind:</l>
<l>'Tis a new manufacture in effect—</l>
<l>And yours, my sowls t' encourage and protect;</l>
<l>No critic custom then exacted be,</l>
<l>Pass it like Irish linen, duty free.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE, Spoken by Mrs. DANCER.</head>
<lg>
<l>THIS virgin author's such a blushing rogue—</l>
<l>What! no gay, lively, laughing epilogue!</l>
<l>"Madam (says he, and look'd so wise) in Greece"—</l>
<l>(Greece; that's their cant) "no jesting clos'd the piece.</l>
<l>"Play, epilogue and all were grave and solemn"—</l>
<l>Then, Sir, the town were fools that did not mawl 'em.</l>
<l>No—let your heroine, in this laughing age,</l>
<l>Come thus (as Bayes says) souse upon the stage;</l>
<l>Then with a jaunty air, half smile, half grin,</l>
<l>Curtsey quite round the boxes, and begin.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>A spark from court, and no one to detect him!</l>
<l>A pretty fellow too, and yet reject him!—</l>
<l>Now, Ladies, let me die but it was silly—</l>
<l>You'll not approve such horrid prudery—will ye?—</l>
<l>I shou'd have bless'd the occasion, and receiv'd him!</l>
<l>He shou'd have kneel'd and vow'd, and I—believ'd him;</l>
<l>Laugh'd, danc'd and sported it till spouse came over,</l>
<l>Then kiss'd my dear—while Betty hid my lover.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But here again our Poet checks my flight,</l>
<l>"Nay, Madam, you mistake the matter quite.</l>
<l>"My heroine liv'd in ancient, honest times;</l>
<l>"Cards were unknown, and gallantries were crimes"—</l>
<l>'Psha! what if females then were seldom rovers?</l>
<l>Husbands—(aye, there's the cause) were warm as lovers.</l>
<l>Their warlike days indeed were spent in killing;</l>
<l>But then, at night—no turtles were so billing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Well—tho' he gives me no smart things to say,</l>
<l>I wish this begging face may save his play:</l>
<l>The thing may mend, and learn to please you better—</l>
<l>Do then—nay, pray you shew him some good nature.</l>

<p>The countess of SALISBURY, to her illustrious Friend, the lord de WARREN.</p>
<p>I have lost my husband—Me and my lands lord Raymond claims, as by royal grant assigned to him. He has banished my train, encompassed me with his creatures, and holds me a prisoner in my own castle. If the memory of thy noble friend be dear to thee, haste and rescue the afflicted<lb/>
ELA.</p>
<l>How near was Raymond's hope, the beauteous hope</l>
<l>He tended with unceasing care, how near</l>
<l>My rising fortunes marr'd—I like not this:</l>
<l>Her, and her rich domains he wou'd possess;</l>
<l>Yet in his breast there lives that kind of heart</l>
<l>Withholds him from the path that's nearest—He,</l>
<l>That wou'd be great, must first be bold.</l>
<l>I hate those motley'd characters;</l>
<l>Something, I know not what, 'twixt good and ill,</l>
<l>Yet neither absolute: all good, all ill</l>
<l>For me—That day, saith he, that happy day,</l>
<l>Which sees the countess mine, shall amply pay</l>
<l>Thy services: a doubtful balance this</l>
<l>Whereon my fortunes hang—This way he moves;</l>
<l>And, by his gait and gesture, ill at ease—</l>
<l>We must be firm;</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="10"/>
My hopes demand it, and the time admits</l>
<l>No weak, no scrupulous delay—</l>
<stage>Enter RAYMOND.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>To sue,</l>
<l>But ever without grace to sue—oh Grey!</l>
<l>I am even weary of the vain pursuit.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>It is, in truth, my lord, an irksome labour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>But now I cast me at the fair one's feet;</l>
<l>Pleaded my passion with whatever arts</l>
<l>Might best the gentle purpose aid; but she,</l>
<l>Instead of such return as I might hope,</l>
<l>Repaid me with an eye of cold contempt.</l>
<l>Of her late gallant lord she spoke; his merits</l>
<l>In opposition hateful plac'd to mine.</l>
<l>Urg'd, then, with recollection of her wrongs,</l>
<l>Like the loud torrent, with steep winter rains</l>
<l>O'ercharg'd, in all the loose, ungovern'd sway</l>
<l>Of wrath and indignation, she assail'd me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>And did my lord, in this unseemly fashion,</l>
<l>Hear all with equal temper? Wak'd he not</l>
<l>With such a peal?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>Thou know'st not what it is</l>
<l>To love like me—Long time (for passion now</l>
<l>Had shed o'er all her charms a brighter glow,</l>
<l>That like Jove's daughter most she look'd, severe</l>
<l>In youthful beauty) long I lay, o'eraw'd</l>
<l>And silenc'd as by some superior being;</l>
<l>Till wak'd by pride, quick from the floor I sprung;</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="11"/>
Warn'd her how she provok'd my power;</l>
<l>'Twas great, 'twas now within these walls supreme:</l>
<l>I long had gently woo'd her, but that love,</l>
<l>Tho' patient, would not always brook disdain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>'Twas well: and what ensu'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>Silence at first,</l>
<l>Then tears; bright drops, like May-morn dews that fall</l>
<l>From the sweet blossom'd thorn. Back in her chair</l>
<l>She sunk—Oh! had you seen her then, dissolv'd</l>
<l>In all the soft, the lovely languishment</l>
<l>Of woe; while at her knee, with countenance</l>
<l>Most piteous stood her beauteous boy, and look'd</l>
<l>As if each tear, which from his mother fell,</l>
<l>Wou'd force a passage to his little heart—</l>
<l>I fled; else had I kneel'd, and wept myself</l>
<l>As well as she.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>O shame to manhood!—suits</l>
<l>Such weakness with our hopes?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>She must, she must,</l>
<l>Yes, Grey, she must be mine—and yet—yet fain</l>
<l>Wou'd I persuade the fair one, not compel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>Say to what purpose then was seizd her castle?</l>
<l>When she your suit rejected, then perforce</l>
<l>To claim her as the gift of royal favour!</l>
<l>To lord it here so long, and now to falter—</l>
<l>My lord, my lord, the mound is overleapt,</l>
<l>What now forbids but without further pause</l>
<l>To crop the rich, the golden fruits within?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="12"/>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>Ungracious is the love reluctance yields;</l>
<l>And cold, cold even as marble is the maid,</l>
<l>Who comes unwilling to another's arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>In brief, would you partake the lady's bed?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>What means the question?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>Look on that, my lord:</l>
<l>Better <hi>reluctant</hi> come, than not at all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>—How came this to your hand?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>By one whose cares</l>
<l>Of thee demand no trivial recompence.</l>
<l>His wakeful eye it was descry'd the bearer;</l>
<l>Else had the watch with all their vigilance</l>
<l>Prov'd insufficient.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>My better angel interpos'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>Had this it's purpos'd scope attain'd—my lord,</l>
<l>Were this but whisper'd in our Henry's ear—</l>
<l>He gave the royal nod you say: true, he</l>
<l>Permitted, but thus far; that you should woo</l>
<l>The lady, and her choice approving, wed;</l>
<l>No more. By us the public ear is told</l>
<l>She hath approv'd: our artifice hath spread</l>
<l>The rumour; and with some it is receiv'd</l>
<l>That she is now your full-espoused consort:</l>
<l>But truth, my lord, long cannot rest conceal'd;</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="13"/>
It will abroad, of that be sure, in spite</l>
<l>Of all our studied wiles.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>What's to be done?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>'Tis critical; and must be manag'd nicely—</l>
<l>But see, with Eleanor the countess comes;</l>
<l>And in her hand the young lord William. Here</l>
<l>Her custom is to walk: retire we now;</l>
<l>And thou observe the counsels of a friend.</l>
<stage>[Exeunt ambo.]</stage>
<stage>Enter Lady SALISBURY, Lord WILLIAM, ELEANOR.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady SALISBURY.</speaker>
<l>Talk'st thou of patience? What! the very roof,</l>
<l>That shou'd protect and shelter me, become</l>
<l>My prison! Aw'd, and threatened, as I am,</l>
<l>By this intruder!—Cruel destiny!</l>

<l>In evil hour thy hospitable gates</l>

<l>Who</l>
<l>Can think even yet, that once repuls'd, he e'er</l>
<l>Wou'd thus presume?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady SALISBURY.</speaker>
<l>Is there no succour then?</l>
<l>No generous hand to vindicate my wrongs?—</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="14"/>
Oh Salisbury! Salisbury! why, if yet thou liv'st—</l>
<l>Fond hope! he lives not, else with speed of thought</l>
<l>Would he repair to his afflicted Ela.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELEANOR.</speaker>
<l>Why, dearest lady, will you yield you up</l>
<l>A prey to purpos'd sorrow? Time is fruitful;</l>
<l>And the next hour perhaps may bring thee comfort.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady SALISBURY.</speaker>
<l>Day after day I have watch'd the joyless hours;</l>
<l>Night after night, when some fleet courier sent</l>
<l>Before perchance, or letter fraught with sweet</l>
<l>Assurance of his safety might appear;</l>
<l>Five tedious moons have pass'd since first were told</l>
<l>The dismal tidings; no fleet courier sent</l>
<l>Before, alas! nor letter with such sweet</l>
<l>Assurance vet appears—He's gone, he's lost!</l>
<l>And I shall never, never see him more.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELEANOR.</speaker>
<l>Ah! suffer not the leaden hand of cold</l>
<l>Despair thus weigh thee down; I yet have hope—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady SALISBURY.</speaker>
<l>Away with hope, away. No, no; full loud,</l>
<l>As I remember, and outrageous blew</l>
<l>The storm, that even the solid fabric shook</l>
<l>Of yonder walls; deep-rooted oaks gave way;</l>
<l>Churches and spires were overturn'd; nor even</l>
<l>The peasant's humble roof escap'd that hour.</l>
<l>The fleet, save only one, one luckless ship,</l>
<l>Have all return'd; my lord nor hath been seen,</l>
<l>Alas! nor ever heard of since the storm.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELEANOR.</speaker>
<l>Heaven visit her affliction, and bestow</l>
<l>That patience which she needs.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Lady SALISBURY.</speaker>
<l>No, Eleanor: no more shall he</l>
<l>To these deserted walls return. No more</l>
<l>Shall trophies, won by many a gallant deed,</l>
<l>Thro' the long hall in proud procession move;</l>
<l>No more fair Salisbury's battlements and towers</l>
<l>Re-echo to th' approaching trumpet's voice.</l>
<l>Never, oh! never more shall Ela run</l>
<l>With throbbing bosom at the well-known sound,</l>
<l>T' unlock his helmet, conquest plum'd, to strip</l>
<l>The cuishes from his manly thigh, or snatch</l>
<l>Quick from his breast the plated armour, wont</l>
<l>T' oppose my fond embrace—Sweet times farewel,</l>
<l>These tender offices are now no more.</l>

<pb n="10" facs="17"/>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>To love, but ne'er to reap of love the sweet</l>

<l>And what of that?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>Tho' love denied, yet pity may do much</l>

<l>Thou much-rever'd! my suit is in behalf of Raymond.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady SALISBURY.</speaker>
<l>Then I will spare us both some cost</l>

<l>So tell thy lord—I would be private—hence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>Your words are brief indeed; but of that kind</l>
<l>I dare not, must not bear my lord.</l>
</sp>

<l>'Tis cruel toward the man who loves so fondly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady SALISBURY.</speaker>
<l>Doth he assume the specious name of love?</l>
<l>Love is a bright, a generous quality,</l>
<l>Heaven gave to noble minds; pure, and unmix'd</l>
<l>With every grosser stuff; a goodly flower,</l>
<l>Shoots up and blossoms in great souls alone.</l>

<l>Of glory in the skies?—Th' illustrious name</l>

<l>Th' East Indian bids the sun good-morrow, to where</l>
<l>Th' Atlantic in her wide-extended lap</l>
<l>Receives him setting; cou'd he in each hand</l>
<l>A thousand sceptres place, not all shou'd bribe</l>
<l>Me to his bed—No, Salisbury! thou hast been</l>
<l>The husband of my early love; with thee,</l>
<l>That love was all interr'd; and when I pluck</l>
<l>It forth again, gape wide that earth wherein</l>

<l>Was green; while sorrow yet was in mine eyes?</l>

<l>He came, heap'd up the measure of my woes,</l>

<l>Alwin I am call'd, my fellow-traveller</l>

<l>I knew him well; our liege's near ally,</l>
<l>And second to duke Richard in command.</l>
<l>Fast by his side was my allotted post</l>
<l>Upon the marshal'd field: by him I fought,</l>
<l>For him had died.</l>

<l>Was wreck'd with all his crew.</l>

<l>Us from the blood-stain'd field; exulting each</l>
<l>With some rich spoil, trophies by valiant dint</l>
<l>Of arms atchiev'd. Forthwith the eager host</l>
<l>Embark.</l>
<l>And now the chalky cliffs on Albion's coast</l>
<l>T' our straining view appear'd; th' exulting crew</l>
<l>With peals redoubled greet the well known shores—</l>
<l>Ill-fated men!—in vain the anxious dame</l>
<l>Oft mounts the high-rais'd tower, thence earnest looks</l>
<l>Haply if her wish'd for lord may come; in vain</l>

<l>And heav'd the bosom of the troubled deep.</l>
<l>On the swoln billow sits enthron'd grim Death,</l>
<l>And shakes his fatal dart—The fleet, which late</l>
<l>In such fair order sail'd, is now dispers'd.</l>

<l>Shou'd I recount the story of my fortunes,</l>
<l>Each circumstance, beginning from that day</l>
<l>We parted, to this hour, thine ear wou'd be</l>
<l>Fatigu'd; the stars, ere I had ended, cease</l>

<l>To know the summ.</l>
<l>For England we embark'd, when, black and foul,</l>
<l>A tempest rising, quick upturn'd the seas,</l>

<l>Why need I tell thee, love, how, in disguise,</l>

<l>Thro' dreary vale, o'er mountain wild; my bed</l>
<l>Oft of the blasted heath, whilst o'er my limbs</l>
<l>Dank night hath shaken her cold, dewy wings,</l>
<l>And the chill northern gale hath spent his breath</l>
<l>On my defenceless head?</l>

<l>(The first glad transports of our meeting o'er)</l>
<l>When, with an honest tear, the good old man</l>
<l>In brief disclos'd what fame had now reported;</l>
<l>That thou wert soon, or had'st, ere this, espous'd</l>
<l>Earl Hubert's nephew, and sole purpos'd heir—</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>My unattainted love!—And cou'd my lord—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord SALISBURY.</speaker>
<l>Yet hear me—Strait I grasp'd my sword;</l>
<l>And, single as I was, had sallied forth,</l>
<l>Had not my friend's sage counsels interpos'd.</l>
<l>By Ardolf sway'd, I veil'd me as thou see'st;</l>
<l>And, with a sharer in the dark intent,</l>
<l>Set forward on my way for Sal'sbury castle:</l>
<l>A simple hind's low cottage, not far hence,</l>
<l>Receiv'd us. Here, fast by the green-wood side,</l>
<l>We lodg'd; resolv'd, ourselves unknown, to prove</l>
<l>What doubtful rumour only had proclaim'd.</l>
<l>With this intent, at dusk of evening, we</l>
<l>Forsook the cot—</l>

<l>The night is dark indeed, the tempest high;</l>

<l>Which thy own lips to me have oft repeated:</l>
<l>There is a Power unseen, whose charge it is,</l>
<l>With ever wakeful eye to watch the good;</l>
<l>And peaceful ever is that breast, which trusts</l>
<l>In his angelic guard—The hand</l>
<l>Of Heaven, that hitherto hath been his shield,</l>

Concern'd lord Raymond, when you taught his suit</l>
<l>To hope a prosperous issue; thus by me he speaks:</l>

<l>He waits thy coming; there with pious vows</l>
<l>Exchang'd even now to consecrate thee his.</l>

<l>Heaven shews the bright example; ever prompt</l>
<l>T' incline when virtue lifts her suppliant eye.</l>
<l>But say, that for the present he forbore</l>
<l>His earnest suit, say, shall tomorrow make</l>
<l>Him happy? or tomorrow's night perchance?</l>
<l>Or—what shall be the bright succeeding day?</l>

<l>This night! this hour! who'll make me his this hour?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>A power, my lady, thou shalt learn to fear:</l>
<l>Force, force superior, that with giant hand</l>
<l>Plucks e'en the monarch from his throne; disrobes</l>
<l><pb n="33" facs="40"/>
The virgin of her honour, while distress</l>
<l>With streaming eyes and loose dishevel'd hair</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady SALISBURY.</speaker>
<l>I know the monster thou woud'st fright me with,</l>
<l>But I despise his power—Hast thou ne'er heard?</l>
<l>Learn then of me a truth, a golden truth,</l>
<l>Grav'd on the register of hoary Time:</l>
<l>Virtue, with her own native strength upheld,</l>
<l>Can brave the shock of ruffian force, unmov'd</l>
<l>As is the rock, whose firm-set base not all</l>
<l>The tumult of the western surge can shake,</l>
<l>Tho' the fierce winds uplift him to the stars.</l>

<l>MY lord, you waste the precious hours in cold</l>
<l>Irresolute delays: nor circumstance</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>—Wou'd I had never seen this fatal mansion!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>A sorry wish, my lord. Behold the fierce,</l>
<l>The lordly ranger of the desert wild;</l>
<l>No sluggish fears he knows; he pauses not,</l>
<l>Nor looks behind, but onward speeds him till</l>
<l>He gripes the trembling prey: be ever thus</l>
<l>The youth, whom thirst of love and beauty fires.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>—Away; call forth my train—nay murmur not:</l>
<l>Command that ere the lark proclaim the morn</l>
<l>They hold them each prepar'd. Here I will rest,</l>
<l>If rest I can, this night; to-morrow's sun</l>
<l>Shall see me fled for ever from these walls.</l>

<l>Summon thy train, mount the swift steed, away;</l>
<l>The gates shall open to thy flight—but know,</l>
<l>That shame and scorn shall follow at thy heels.</l>
<l>Yet worse; the insulted baron next pursues thee:</l>
<l>Nor rocks, nor mountains, nor opposing seas</l>
<l>Shall stay him, but with more than mortal rage</l>
<l>He shall assail thee.</l>

<l>None.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>No other way but murder? Horrid thought!—</l>
<l>Oh Grey if e'er the dagger's drawn I feel</l>
<l>Such perturbation here, what then, oh what</l>
<l>Shall prove my portion when 'tis steep'd in blood?</l>
<l>The drops can from the point be wip'd away,</l>
<l>But never from the mind.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>Lift, lift thine eye,</l>
<l>And let it gaze upon the bright reward.</l>
<l>Riches and honours grace the swelling act,</l>
<l>While beauty, like the ruby-crowned morn,</l>
<l>When first she peers upon the mountain top,</l>
<l>Comes smiling on to meet you—These are objects,</l>
<l>My lord, would irritate the palsied arm</l>
<l>Itself of fear; excite the lagging blood,</l>
<l>And spur it on to acts of noble daring.</l>

<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>What wou'd you do?—Think—Salisbury is a name</l>

<sp>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<l>Such wary counsels shall our steps o'er-rule</l>
<l>As may deride suspicion—One there is,</l>
<l>A knight among thy vassal train perhaps</l>
<l>Unnoted: soft of speech he is, and fair;</l>
<l>But of a heart that mocks at human feelings:</l>
<l>Him I have sounded with reserve; and find</l>
<l>Him not unapt to this our secret purpose—</l>

<l>My lord, my lord,</l>

<l>Be not rash.</l>
<l>Short is the date of every stronger passion;</l>
<l>Unstay'd the mind of woman; by a breath</l>
<l>Oft agitated, by a breath compos'd—</l>
<l>Yield them, my lord! it wou'd be madness, ruin.</l>

<l>Which ever way I turn, it is destruction.</l>
</sp>

<l>O'ercast with fear, thine eye takes nothing in</l>
<l>But fancies of the sickliest hue—For shame,</l>
<l>Rouse, rouse my noble lord; awake, shake off</l>
<l>This weakness. Pleasure must be woo'd with toil.</l>
<l>Go to her, solace her; if that shou'd fail,</l>
<l>Permit her as by stealth to visit Salisbury;</l>
<l>At sight of him this tumult shall subside.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>With love and pity I am torn. In vain</l>
<l>I strive; too far I am advanc'd in error.</l>
<l>Oh! will no hand disclose a path whereby</l>
<l>I may return?—Accurs'd be thou, myself;</l>

<l>If he resign them, Salisbury is appeas'd,</l>
<l>And he retires: what then becomes of Grey?</l>
<l>On me, on me of course the tempest falls.</l>
<l>That must not be—He goes to see her now—</l>
<l>Who knows what new-sprung hope may follow thence?</l>
<l>There is a charm in soft distress, that works</l>
<l>Upon the soul like magic; causing love</l>
<l>Oft times, as oft exciting loose desire—</l>
<l>It is most apt. I will, before he goes</l>
<l>To her, explore each access to his heart;</l>
<l>Attack each avenue that leads to virtue;</l>
<l>Try every mining art that may assist</l>
<l>The loose contagion: Shou'd he seize her beauties,</l>

<l>A generous foe!—The brave indeed aspire</l>
<l>To generous acts; their every thought looks up,</l>
<l>And honour's dictates are their only function:</l>
<l>But thou!—what terms woud'st thou propose? What act</l>

<l>—Indeed!</l>
<l>Lives there so much of honour then within thee?</l>
<l>Spite of the mighty wrongs which thou hast done</l>

<l>Now Fortune mark her favourite!—</l>

<l>Oh! generous! generous even to cruelty!—</l>

<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>Ask, ask that villain; he will answer all—</l>
<l>That villain Grey! whose wicked arts seduc'd me—</l>

<l>What ills await the wretch, who gives his ear—</l>
<l>To vicious counsels—</l>

<l>Dreadful proof, indeed!—</l>

<l>My lord, by my assistance he has fled.</l>

<l>'Tis well.</l>

<l>Friends, I am much beholden to you all.</l>
<l>My love! the gloom, that overspread our morn,</l>

<l>Recall'd, shall be th' amusing narrative,</l>
<l>And story of our future evening, oft</l>
<l>Rehears'd. Our son too—he shall hang upon</l>
<l>The sounds, and lift his little hands in praise</l>
<l>To Heav'n; taught by his mother's bright example,</l>
<l>That, to be truly good, is to be bless'd.</l>
