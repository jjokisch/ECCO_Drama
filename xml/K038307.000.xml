<p>IT seems somewhat extraordinary, that altho' with persons of merit, no virtue stands in higher estimation than the love of truth; yet the surest means to offend them in addrsses of this nature, is a strict adherence to it; and it will be a singular circumstance to see a Dedication without praise, to a Lady possessed of every quality and accomplishment, which can justly intitle her to it.</p>

<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
<p>AMONG the great names, which have done honor to antiquity in general, and to the Roman Republic in particular, that of <hi>Marcus Attilius Regulus</hi> has, by the general consent of all ages, been considered as one of the most respectable, since he not only sacrificed his labours, his liberty, and his life for the good of his country; But by a greatness of soul, almost peculiar to himself, contrived to make his very misfortunes contribute to that glorious end.</p>
<p>After the Romans had met with various successes in the first Punic War, under the command of Regulus, victory at length declared for the opposite party, the Roman Army was totally overthrown, and Regulus himself taken prisoner, by <hi>Xantippus,</hi> a Lacedoemonian General in the service of the Carthaginians: the victorious enemy, exulting in so important a conquest, kept him many years in close imprisonment, and loaded him with the most cruel Indignities. They thought it was new in their power to make their own terms with Rome, and determined to send Regulus thither, with their Ambassador, to negotiate a peace, or at least, an exchange of captives, thinking be would gladly persuade his countrymen to discontinue a war, which necessarily prolonged his captivity. They previously exacted from him an oath to return should his embassy prove unsuccessful; at the same time giving him to understand, that he must expect to suffer a cruel death if he failed in it; this they artfully intimated, as the strongest motive for him to leave no means unattempted to accomplish their purpose.</p>
<p>At the unexpected arrival of this venerable hero, the Romans express'd the wildest transports of joy, and would have submitted to almost any conditions to procure his enlargement;
<pb facs="4" ana="y"/>
but, Regulus so far from availing himself of his influence with the Senate to obtain any personal advantages, employed it to induce them to reject proposals so evidently tending to dishonour their country, declaring his fixed resolution to return to bondage, and death, rather than violate his cath.</p>
<p>He at Last extorted from them their consent; and departed amidst the tears of his family, the importunities of his friends, the applauses of the Senate, and the tumultuous opposition of the people; and as a great poet of his own nation beautifully observes, he embarked for Carthage as calm and unconcerned, as if, on finishing the tedious law-suits of his clients, he was retiring to Venafrian fields, or the sweet country of <hi>Tarentum.</hi><note place="foot">HOR. Book III. Ode 5.</note></p>
<p>In the above, and many other important particulars, the Author has paid the strictest regard to historical truth: In some less essential points, where she thought it would rather obstruct than advance her purpose, she has ventured to deviate from it; particularly, in fixing the return of Regulus to Rome, posterior to the death of his wife Martia. In <hi>this,</hi> and in the <hi>general</hi> conduct of the story, she has followed the Italian poet Metastasio in his Opera of <hi>three</hi> acts: of which she has given a free translation, and made such <hi>additions,</hi> as were necessary to form it into a tragedy of <hi>five</hi> acts.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE</head>
<byline>BY THE REV. DR. LANGHORNE.</byline>
<l>DEEP in the bosom of departed days,</l>
<l>Where the first gems of human glory blaze;</l>
<l>Where, crown'd with flowers, in wreaths immortal drest,</l>
<l>The sacred shades of ancient virtue rest;</l>
<l>With joy they search, who joy can feel, to find</l>
<l>Some honest reason still to love mankind.</l>
<l>There the fair foundress of the scene to night,</l>
<l>Explores the paths that dignify delight;</l>
<l>The regions of the mighty dead pervades;</l>
<l>The sybil she that leads us to the shades.</l>
<l>O may each blast of ruder breath forbear</l>
<l>To wast her light leaves on the worthless air,</l>
<l>Since she, as heedless, strives not to maintain</l>
<l>This tender offspring of her teeming brain:</l>
<l>For this poor birth was no provision made,</l>
<l>A flower that sprung, and languish'd in the shade.</l>
<l>On Avon's banks, forsaken and forlorn,</l>
<l>This careless mother left her elder born;</l>
<l>And tho' unlike that Avon hail'd of yore,</l>
<l>Those giant sons that Shakespeare's banners bore,</l>
<l>Yet may we yield this little offspring grace,</l>
<l>And love the last and least of such a race.</l>
<l>Shall the strong scenes, where senatorial Rome</l>
<l>Mourn'd o'er the rigour of her patriot's doom;</l>
<l>Where melting nature, aw'd by virtue's eye,</l>
<l>Hid the big drop, and held the bursting sigh;</l>
<l>Where all that Majesty of soul can give,</l>
<l>Truth, honor, pity, fair affection, live;</l>
<l>Shall scenes like these, the glory of an age,</l>
<l>Gleam from the press, nor triumph on the stage</l>
<l>Forbid it, Britons! and, as Romans brave,</l>
<l>Like Romans boast one citizen to save.</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> LICINIUS, ATTILIA, <hi>Lictors and People.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Licin.</speaker>
<l>AH, my Attilia, do I find thee here?</l>
<l>Is this a place for Regulus's daughter?</l>
<l>Just Gods! must that incomparable maid</l>
<l>Associate here with Lictors and Plebeians?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>Yes, on this threshold patiently I wait</l>
<l>The Consul's coming; I would make him blush</l>
<l>To see me here his suitor. O Licinius,</l>
<l>This is no time for form, and cold decorum;</l>
<l>Five lagging years have crept their tedious round</l>
<l>And Regulus, alas! is, still a slave;</l>
<l>A wretched slave, unpitied, and forgotten;</l>
<l>No other tribute paid his memory,</l>
<l>Than the sad tears of his unhappy child;</l>
<l>If <hi>she</hi> be silent who will speak for Regulus?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Licin.</speaker>
<l>Let not her sorrows make my Fair unjust.</l>
<l>Is there in Rome a heart so dead to virtue</l>
<l>That does not beat in Regulus's cause?</l>
<l>That wearies not the Gods for his return?</l>
<l>That does not think all subjugated Afric,</l>
<l>A slender, unimportant acquisition,</l>
<l>If, in return, for all this added empire,</l>
<l>The freedom of thy father be the purchase?</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="8"/>These are <hi>Rome</hi>'s feelings, for my lov'd Attilia,</l>
<l>If were superfluous, to declare <hi>my own.</hi></l>
<l>If thy <hi>Licinius</hi> were to weigh his merit,</l>
<l>That he's <hi>thy father</hi> were sufficient glory.</l>
<l>He was my leader, train'd me up to arms,</l>
<l>And if I boast some sparks of Roman honor,</l>
<l>I owe them to his precepts and <hi>his</hi> virtues.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>And yet I have not aught observ'd, Licinius‚Äî</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Licin.</speaker>
<l>Ah! spare me thy reproaches‚Äîwhat could I</l>
<l>When but a private Citizen perform?</l>
<l>'Tis not the lust of power, or pride of rank,</l>
<l>Has made me seek the dignity of Tribune;</l>
<l>No, my Attilia, but I fondly hop'd</l>
<l>'Twould strengthen and inforce the just request,</l>
<l>Which as a <hi>private</hi> man I <hi>vainly</hi> made;</l>
<l>But now, the people's representative,</l>
<l>I shall <hi>demand,</hi> Attilia, to be heard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>Ah! let us not too hastily apply</l>
<l>This dang'rous remedy; I would not rouse</l>
<l>Fresh tumults 'twixt the people and the senate:</l>
<l>Each views with jealousy the idol, power,</l>
<l>Which, each possessing, would alike abuse.</l>
<l>Whatever wish'd-for boon the <hi>one</hi> demands,</l>
<l>The <hi>other</hi> thro' reluctant pride denies.</l>
<l>Might <hi>I</hi> advise you, try a <hi>gentler</hi> method;</l>
<l>I know that every moment Rome expects</l>
<l>Th' Ambassador of Carthage, and I've heard</l>
<l>The Conscript Fathers are already met</l>
<l>To give him audience in Bellona's temple.</l>
<l>There might the Consul at my suit, Licinius,</l>
<l>Propose the ransom of my captive father.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Licin.</speaker>
<l>Ah! think, Attilia, who that Consul is,</l>
<l>Manlius, thy father's rival, and his foe:</l>
<l>His ancient rival, and his foe prosess'd;</l>
<l>To hope in him, my fair, were fond delusion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>Yet, tho' his <hi>rival,</hi> Manlius is a <hi>Roman:</hi></l>
<l>Nor will he think of private enmities,</l>
<l>Weigh'd in the balance with the good of Rome.</l>
<l>Let me at least make trial of his honour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Licin.</speaker>
<l>Be it so, my fair, but <hi>elsewhere</hi> make thy suit,</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="9"/>Let not the Consul meet Attilia <hi>here,</hi></l>
<l>Confounded with the refuse of the people;</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>Yes, I will see him <hi>here,</hi> e'en <hi>here,</hi> Licinius.</l>
<l>Let <hi>Manlius</hi> blush, not <hi>me: Here</hi> will I speak,</l>
<l><hi>Here</hi> shall he answer me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Licin.</speaker>
<l>Behold he comes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>Do thou retire.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Licin.</speaker>
<l>O bless me with a look,</l>
<l>One parting look at least.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>Know, my Licinius,</l>
<l>That at this moment I am all the <hi>daughter,</hi></l>
<l>The <hi>filial</hi> feelings <hi>now</hi> possess my soul,</l>
<l>And <hi>other</hi> passions find no entrance there.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Licin.</speaker>
<l>O sweet, yet powerful influence of virtue,</l>
<l>That charms tho' cruel, tho' unkind subdues,</l>
<l>And what was love exalts to admiration!</l>
<l>Yes, 'tis the privilege of souls like thine</l>
<l>To conquer most when least they aim at conquest.</l>
<l>Yet, ah! vouchsafe, thou noblest among women,</l>
<l>Sometimes to think with pity on Licinius,</l>
<l>Nor fear to rob thy father of his due;</l>
<l>For surely Virtue, and the Gods, approve</l>
<l>Unwearied constancy, and spotless love.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Licinius.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> MANLIUS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>Ah! Manlius stay, a moment stay, and hear me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Manl.</speaker>
<l>I did not think to meet thee here, Attilia,</l>
<l>Here, in a place so little worthy of thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>It <hi>were</hi> unworthy, did Attilia boast</l>
<l>A godlike father free from cruel bondage;</l>
<l>But for the daughter of a slave to Carthage,</l>
<l>It surely is most sitting.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Manl.</speaker>
<l>Say, Attilia,</l>
<l>What is the purpose of thy coming hither?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>What is the purpose, patience, patience,</l>
<l>Heaven!</l>
<l>Tell me, how long, to Rome's eternal shame,</l>
<l>To fill with horror all the wond'ring world,</l>
<l>My father still must groan in Punic chains,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="10"/>And waste the tedious hours in sad captivity?</l>
<l>Days follow days, and years to years succeed,</l>
<l>And Rome forgets her hero is a slave.</l>
<l>Has he, alas! <hi>deserv'd</hi> to be forgotten?</l>
<l>What is his crime? is it to have preferr'd</l>
<l>His country's profit to his children's good?</l>
<l>Is it th' unshaken firmness of his soul,</l>
<l>Just, uncorrupt, invariably good?</l>
<l>Perhaps his <hi>pov'erty</hi> has been his fault,</l>
<l><hi>Poor</hi> in the highest dignities of <hi>Rome:</hi></l>
<l><hi>Illustrious error, glorious poverty!</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Manl.</speaker>
<l>But know, Attilia ‚Äî</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>Yet awhile attend.</l>
<l>And can ungrateful <hi>Rome</hi> so soon forget?</l>
<l>Can those who breathe the air <hi>he</hi> breath'd forget</l>
<l>The great, the godlike virtues of my father?</l>
<l>There's not <hi>a part</hi> of Rome but speaks his praise.</l>
<l>The <hi>streets</hi>‚Äîthro' them the <hi>hero</hi> pass'd triumphant</l>
<l>The <hi>Forum</hi>‚Äîthere the <hi>Legislator</hi> plann'd</l>
<l>The wisest, wholsomest, and purest laws;</l>
<l>The <hi>Senate-house</hi>‚Äîthere spoke the <hi>patriot Roman,</hi></l>
<l>There oft' his voice secur'd the public safety:</l>
<l>The wisdom of his councils match'd his valor.</l>
<l>Enter the <hi>Temples</hi>‚Äîmount the <hi>Capitol.</hi>‚Äî</l>
<l>And tell me, Manlius, to what hand but <hi>his</hi></l>
<l>They owe their trophies, and their ornaments,</l>
<l>Their foreign banners, and their boasted ensigns,</l>
<l>Tarentine, Punic, and Sicilian spoils?</l>
<l>Nay ev'n those Lictors, who precede thy steps,</l>
<l>This Consul's purple, which invests thy limbs.</l>
<l>All, all were Regulus's, were my father's.</l>
<l>And yet this hero, this exalted patriot,</l>
<l>This man of virtue, this immortal Roman,</l>
<l>In base requital for his services,</l>
<l>Is left to linger out a life in chains,</l>
<l>No honors paid him but a daughter's tears,</l>
<l>O Rome! O Regulus! O thankless Citizens!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Manl.</speaker>
<l>Just are thy tears:‚ÄîThy father well deserves them</l>
<l>But know thy censure is unjust, Attilia.</l>
<l>The fate of Regulus is felt by all:</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="11"/>We know and mourn the cruel woes he suffers</l>
<l>From barbarous Carthage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>Manlius, you mistake,</l>
<l>Alas! it is not Carthage, which is barbarous;</l>
<l>'Tis Rome, ungrateful Rome is the Barbarian;</l>
<l>Carthage but punishes a foe profess'd,</l>
<l>But Rome betrays her hero, and her father;</l>
<l>Carthage remembers how he slew her sons,</l>
<l>But Rome forgets the blood he lost for <hi>her;</hi></l>
<l>Carthage revenges an acknowledg'd foe,</l>
<l>But Rome with basest perfidy rewards</l>
<l>The glorious hand, that bound her brow with laurels.</l>
<l>Which now is the barbarian, Rome, or Carthage?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Manl.</speaker>
<l>What can be done?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attil.</speaker>
<l>Need I instruct you what?</l>
<l>Convene the Senate; let them strait propose</l>
<l>A ransom, or exchange for Regulus,</l>
<l>To Africa's Ambassador. Do this,</l>
<l>And heav'n's best blessings crown your days with peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Manl.</speaker>
<l>Thou speakest like a <hi>daughter,</hi> I, Attilia,</l>
<l>Must as a <hi>Consul</hi> act; I must consult</l>
<l>The good of Rome, her glory, her renown.</l>
<l>Would it not tarnish her unspotted fame,</l>
<l>To sue to Carthage on the terms thou wishest?</l>
</sp>

<l>Ah! rather own thou art still my father's foe.</l>

<l>Drew back‚Äîstood all collected in himself,</l>
<l>And said austerely, know, thou rash young man,</l>
<l>That <hi>slaves</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> have not the rights of <hi>fathers.</hi></l>
<l>Then ask'd, if yet the senate was assembled,</l>
<l>And <hi>where;</hi> which having heard, without indulging</l>
<l>The fond effusions of his soul, or mine,</l>
<l>He suddenly retir'd. I flew with speed</l>

<l>This still is mine‚Äîand I'll preserve it, Romans!</l>
<l>The wealth of Plutus shall not bribe it from me!</l>
<l>If you, alas! require this sacrifice,</l>
<l>Carthage herself was less my foe than Rome;</l>
<l>She took my freedom‚Äîshe could take no more;</l>
<l>But Rome, to crown her work, wou'd take my honor.</l>
<l>My friends I if you deprive me of my chains,</l>
<l>I am no more than any other slave:</l>
<l>Yes, Regulus becomes a common captive,</l>
<l>A wretched, lying, perjur'd sugitive!</l>
<l>But if, to grace my bonds, you leave my honor,</l>
<l>I shall be still a Roman, tho! a slave.</l>

<l>Unworthy subterfuge! ah! let us leave,</l>
<l>To the wild Arab and the faithless Moor,</l>
<l>These wretched maxims of deceit and fraud:</l>
<l>Examples ne'er can justify the coward:</l>
<l>The brave man never seeks a vindication,</l>
<l>Save from his own just bosom and the Gods;</l>
<l>From principle, not precedent, he acts:</l>
<l><pb n="50" facs="56"/>As that arraigns him, or as that acquits,</l>
<l>He stands, or falls; condemn'd, or justify'd.</l>

<l>Rome is no more if Regulus departs.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Reg.</speaker>
<l>Let Rome remember Regulus must die!</l>
<l>Nor wou'd the moment of my death be distant,</l>
<l>If nature's work had been reserv'd for nature.</l>
<l>What Carthage means to do, <hi>she</hi> wou'd have done,</l>
<l>As speedily perhaps, at least as surely.</l>
<l>My wearied life has almost reach'd it's goal;</l>
<l>The once-warm current stagnates in these veins,</l>
<l>Or thro' it's icey channels slowly creeps:</l>
<l>View the weak arm, and the pale, surrow'd cheek,</l>
<l>The slacken'd finew, and the dim, sunk eye,</l>
<l>And tell me <hi>then</hi> I must not think of dying!</l>
<l>How can I serve you else? My feeble limbs</l>
<l>Wou'd totter now beneath the armour's weight,</l>
<l>The burthen of that body it once shielded.</l>
<l>You see, me friends, you see, my countrymen,</l>
<l>I can no longer shew myself a Roman,</l>
<l>Except by <hi>dying</hi> like one.‚ÄîGracious Heaven</l>
<l>Has pointed out a glorious way to crown</l>
<l>A life of virtue with a death of honor.</l>
<l>Oh! do not frustrate then the will of Jove,</l>
<l>And load my latest hours with infamy.</l>
<l>Come, come, I know my noble Romans better;</l>
<l>I see your souls. I read repentance in them;</l>
<l>Yon all applaud me‚Äînay, you wish my chains:</l>
<l>'Twas nothing but excess of love misled you,</l>
<l>And, as you're Romans, you will conquer that.</l>
<l>Yes!‚ÄîI perceive your weakness is subdu'd.‚Äî</l>
<l>Seize, seize the moment of returning virtue;</l>
<l>Throw to the ground, my sons, those hostile arms:</l>
<l>Retard no longer Regulus's triumph:</l>
<l>I do request it of you, as a friend,</l>
<l>Exhort you to your duty, as a patriot,</l>
<l>And, were I still your Gen'ral, would command you.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE</head>
<byline><hi>by</hi> DAVID GARRICK, <hi><abbr>Esq</abbr></hi></byline>
<l>WHAT son of physic, but his art extends,</l>
<l>As well as hand, when call'd on by his friends?</l>
<l>What landlord is so weak to make you fast,</l>
<l>When guests like you bespeak a good repast?</l>
<l>But weaker still were he whom sate has plac'd</l>
<l>To sooth your cares, and gratify your taste,</l>
<l>Should be neglect to bring before your eyes</l>
<l>Those dainty dramas which from Genius rise;</l>
<l>Whether your luxury be to smile or weep,</l>
<l>His and your profits just proportion keep.</l>
<l>To night he brought, nor fears a due reward,</l>
<l>A Roman patriot by a female bird.</l>
<l>Britons who feel his flame, his worth will rate,</l>
<l>No common spirit his, no common fate,</l>
<l>INFLEXIBLE and CAPTIVE must be great.</l>
<l>"How," cries a sucking fop, thus lounging, straddling,</l>
<l>(Whose head shews want of ballast by its noddling)</l>
<l>"A woman write? learn, madam, of your betters,</l>
<l>"And read a noble Lord's <hi>Post-hu-mous Letters.</hi></l>
<l>"There you will learn the sex may merit praise,</l>
<l>"By making puddings‚Äînot by making plays:</l>
<l>"They can make tea and mischief, dance and sing;</l>
<l>"Their heads, tho' full of feathers, can't take wing."</l>
<l>I thought they cou'd, Sir;‚Äînow and then by chance,</l>
<l>Maids fly to Scotland, and some wives to France.</l>
<l>He still went noddling on‚Äî"Do all she can,</l>
<l>"Woman's a trifle‚Äîplay-thing‚Äîlike her fan;</l>
<l>Right, Sir, and when a wife the <hi>rattle</hi> of man.</l>
<l>And shall such things as these become the test</l>
<l>Of female worth? the fairest and the best</l>
<l>Of all heaven's creatures? for so Milton sung us,</l>
<l>And with such champions, who shall dare to wrong us?</l>
<l>Come forth, proud man, in all your powers array'd;</l>
<l>Shine out in all your splendor‚ÄîWho's afraid?</l>
<l>Who on French wit has made a glorious war,</l>
<l>Defended Shakespear, and subdu'd Voltaire?</l>
<l>Woman<note n="‚Ä†" place="foot">Mrs. Montagne, author of an essay on the writings of Shakespeare.</note>‚ÄîWho, rich in knowledge, knows no pride,</l>
<l>Can boast ten tongues, and yet not satisfied?</l>
<l>Woman<note n="‚Ä°" place="foot">Mrs.Carter, well known for her skill in ancient and modern languages.</note>‚ÄîWho lately sung the sweetest lay?</l>
<l>A woman, woman, woman<note n="‚Äñ" place="foot">Miss Aikin, who latly published some excellent poems.</note> still I say.</l>
<l>Well then, who dares deny our power and might?</l>
<l>Will any married man dispute our right?</l>
<l>Speak boldly, Sirs,‚Äîyour wives are not in sight.</l>
<l>What! are you silent? then you are content;</l>
<l>Silence, the proverb tells us, gives consent.</l>
<l>Critics, will you allow our honest claim?</l>
<l>Are you dumb too? This night has fix'd our fame.</l>
