<p>THE INSOLVENT: OR, FILIAL PIETY. A TRAGEDY.</p>
<p>ACTED AT THE THEATRE in the HAY-MARKET, (By AUTHORITY) Under the DIRECTION of Mr. CIBBER.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>ABOVE thirty years ago, Mr. WILKS (then one of the patentees of the theatre royal) gave an old manuscript play, call'd, <hi>The Guiltless Adultress; or, Judge in his own Cause,</hi> to Mr. THEOPHILUS CIBBER, who was then manager of what us'd to be call'd, <hi>the summer company.</hi> This company consisted, in general, of the junior part of the performers; who, during the vacation time, commonly acted twice, or thrice, a week. As they play'd on shares (divided in proportion according to their several salaries stipulated in the winter) their endeavours to please the town generally produc'd 'em double pay, on those nights; sometimes more.</p>
<p>This kept most of 'em from strolling into the country, for the summer season: it added to their income, and gave 'em an opportunity of getting forward in their business, in a more regular manner, than has been practis'd of late years. It had its effect: performers then try'd their force in characters, in the summer; and became, by practice therein, gradually acquainted with their business, and the town with them. Nor was every one suppos'd to be equal, at their very setting out, to the most capital characters of the drama.</p>
<p>But to return to the play.—By the hand, and the long time it had been in the possession of the managers, it was suppos'd to have been one of Sir WILLIAM D'AVENANT's (formerly a patentee) and, by the opening of the piece, palpably was founded on a play of MASSENGER's, call'd, <hi>The Fatal Dowry—</hi>(this last piece has often been enquired after in vain)—Mr. WILKS recommended it to Mr. CIBBER to be got up in the summer, with some alterations—It lay by some time.—In the year 1733, it was intended for the stage in the summer—But the performers were then shut out of the theatre, by the then patentees of Drury-Lane.—A candid account of which will be given, when Mr. CIBBER has a proper opportunity to speak thereof, in his purpos'd history of the stage.</p>
<p><pb facs="3"/>
In the following year, when the principal comedians of that time return'd from the theatre in the Hay-Market, and play'd under the direction of Mr. FLETEWOOD, it was propos'd agen to have a summer company; as the use of it, both to the actors and managers, had been experienced. Many light pieces were then reviv'd, and several new petit pieces brought on the stage; such as, <hi>The Devil to Pay, The Mock Doctor,</hi> &amp;c. which prov'd afterwards lasting entertainments in the winter season.</p>
<p>'Twas in <hi>The Devil to Pay,</hi> in a summer season, Mrs. CLIVE (then Miss KAFTOR) first surpriz'd a delighted audience with a proof of her extraordinary genius, in the character of NELL. Her spirited simplicity, and strong natural humour, carried her thro' the part with an astonishing variety, and propriety. She shew'd herself an excellent original.—She has had many followers, some imitators; and, 'tis but justice to add, no equal. She then promis'd to be, what she has since prov'd, one of the first performers of the stage: and, when judiciously examined in the general various cast of parts she acts, 'tis imagined, she will be allow'd not to be inferior to any performer of her time.</p>
<p>Well, this is digression on digression—(pardon it, reader, and let it pass)—In 1734, a summer company was agen propos'd. They play'd once the play of <hi>George Barnwell,</hi> to a very great house. The manager (jealous, least the company shou'd get too much) order'd the farther acting to be stopp'd. It was judg'd, indeed, the jealousy of some actors (who were not concern'd in the summer) gave this advice—so the affair dropp'd—and there has been no summer playing since.</p>
<p>But, to return to our play.—On a revisal, it was judg'd to want some alterations—Accordingly, Mr. CIBBEE requested his kind friend the late Mr. HILL (who was never happier than when he had an opportunity to do a friendly office) to correct it—How much he was taken with the play, will appear on a perusal of some letters of his relative thereto, (publish'd in his collection) and sent to Mr. THEOPHILUS CIBBER, about the year 1746.—Let it suffice here, to add—Mr. HILL almost new wrote the whole; and the last act was entirely his, in conduct, sentiment, diction, &amp;c.</p>
<p><pb facs="4"/>
It was brought on the stage at the theatre in the Hay-Market early this year, 1758—When his Grace the Duke of DEVONSHIRE humanely consider'd the unfortunate, extraordinary condition of a comedian (who has had more frequent opportunities of happily entertaining the town) and gave him liberty to try his fortune, awhile, at the little theatre in the Hay-Market.</p>
<p>But what mighty matters could be hop'd, from a young, raw, unexperienced company, hastily collected, and as hastily to be employ'd (but sinking men catch at reeds) while establish'd theatres were open to entertain the town, with the united force of tragedy, comedy, opera, pantomime, song, dance, and a long train of <hi>et ceteras—</hi>Some rational, and some other exhibitions, which are so frequently follow'd in a winter season?</p>
<p>Mr. CIBBER was out of pocket by his undertaking; yet this does not prevent his having a grateful sense of the favours he received, from those noble personages, and other friends, who have frequently pratonis'd his undertakings.—To acknowledge a favour, is but gratitude—To name the persons, might appear vanity.</p>
<p>It may not be improper, on this occasion to signify, as Mr. CIBBER has not had the wish'd success at the theatre in the Hay-Market—That Mr. RICH has, with great good-nature, granted the use of his theatre in Covent-Garden to Mr. CIBBER, for his benefit, the beginning of next month—When a <hi>new mock-tragedy,</hi> (which many persons of taste have approv'd of, and which the author has kindly allow'd Mr. CIBBER to make use of on this occasion) will be acted, with all the variety of scenes, machines, songs, dirges, processions, &amp;c. &amp;c.—requisite to embellish (<hi>a-la-moderne</hi>) this extraordinary heroick piece.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoke by Mr. CIBBER. (Then in mourning for his father)</stage>
<lg>
<l>OUR scenes, to-night, would nature's pangs impart;</l>
<l>True filiel piety should reach the heart.</l>
<l>I feel it now—That thought the tear shall claim;</l>
<l>To merit sacred, and immortal fame.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now sleeps the honour'd dust, which gave me birth;</l>
<l>Recent in death, but newly lodg'd in earth:</l>
<l>Forgive the heart-felt grief! the filial lay!</l>
<l>The public tear might drop o'er CIBBER's clay!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>His comic force—for more than half an age;</l>
<l>His well-wrote moral scene, his manly page,</l>
<l>Your fathers fathers pleas'd—His scenes shall live;</l>
<l>And, to your childrens children, equal pleasure give.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Forgive the filial dews that thus distil—</l>
<l>'Tis from the heart they flow, and not from skill:</l>
<l>By nature mov'd, your patience thus I try;</l>
<l>Art would but give my suff'ring soul the lie.</l>
<l>Now for the father's sake, the son endure;</l>
<l>Let his paternal worth your smile secure.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Let his rich merit my poor wants attone;</l>
<l>His high desert I plead—Boast none my own.</l>
<l>Let then this tribute, to the father due;</l>
<l>This public tribute, be approv'd by you.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Whatever faults may thro' this piece be shewn,</l>
<l>No living bard can now those faults attone,</l>
<l>While such you, transient, mark—Let mercy spare,</l>
<l>Such parts as you may think some merit share.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Where judgment wakes, let candour intervene,</l>
<l>Mark out the failings with that golden mean,</l>
<l>Nor for a single sentence damn a scene.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>To our young actors too your smiles extend;</l>
<l>Youth claims indulgence—as want claims a friend:</l>
<l>Whate'er their flatt'ring hopes, their fears are great,</l>
<l>Which your applause alone can dissipate:</l>
<l>And, 'tis a maxim with the truly brave,</l>
<l>They triumph most, who generously save.</l>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>By the Late AARON HILL, <abbr><hi>Esq</hi></abbr></byline>
<lg>
<l>POOR (at first op'ning) seems the plot we chuse:</l>
<l>But no felt indigence unfir'd the muse.</l>
<l>Insolvent pris'ner—bears no awful sound!</l>
<l>Yet—hope strong buildings—on that humble ground.</l>
<l>Debtor and creditor th' account begin:</l>
<l>But then comes joy—wife—mis'ry—death and sin!</l>
<l>While, from these varying lights, fierce fires we raise,</l>
<l>Lend but attention—and your tears shall praise.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Few are the public stains, that tinge the fame</l>
<l>Of this brave, rich, good-natur'd nation's name:</l>
<l>Yet, one there is—from time's long license, grown—</l>
<l>That blots out pity—and turns flesh, to stone.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>'Tis—the deaf rage, that (where hard wants oppress)</l>
<l>Doubles th' insolvent suff'rer's dire distress.</l>
<l>Stung by this wasp, past friendships lose their weight;</l>
<l>Warp'd estimation wears a face like hate:</l>
<l>Suspended mercy bids affliction smart;</l>
<l>And, in a scale of flint, immures her heart.</l>
<l>Self—yet, unreach'd by woe—made proud, by gain,</l>
<l>Blind to disaster—and insulting pain;</l>
<l>In ease, short-sighted—hugs her lot, secure—</l>
<l>And marks no diff'rence—'twixt the base, and poor;</l>
<l>Flings from calamity, turns short on grief,</l>
<l>And, to the prison's grave, refers relief.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>So—for awhile—triumphantly severe!</l>
<l>Tow'rs the bid insult—and disdains to hear.</l>
<l>At last, comes disappointment home—Then, starts</l>
<l>Touch'd sense—and wonders at mens cruel hearts!</l>
<l>Then (self still upmost) the rous'd sleeper shakes;</l>
<l>And insolently hopes—compassion wakes!</l>
<l>But scorn close waits upon the scorner's heel;</l>
<l>And he, that shunn'd to hear—vouchsafes to feel.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Too late, he feels!—The Eye, that wakes for all,</l>
<l>Fore-doom'd his anguish—and enjoys his fall;</l>
<l><pb facs="7"/>
Points, to his trembling view, that wise man's school—</l>
<l>That god-given law—th' all-temp'ring golden rule:</l>
<l>Bids him thank bitterness, for due despair;</l>
<l>And, since he cou'd not pity, learn to bear.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>From our last age's plays exemplar aim,</l>
<l>Present and past, we find too much the same:</l>
<l>Stern, unrelenting int'rest's partial will</l>
<l>Reign'd then resistless—and it reigns so still.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>How happy were th' effect—cou'd miseries, here,</l>
<l>From pride's correction (mourn'd by pity's tear)</l>
<l>Teach the dry rock to melt, in pain-touch'd flow;</l>
<l>And ease th' unhoping crouds, that sigh, in woe!</l>

<l>Too heavy trust! it press'd my conscious weakness:</l>

<l>It must not be; nor can your lordships goodness</l>

<speaker>ADVOCATE.</speaker>
<l>'Tis the cause speaks.—Great Burgundy's blest state</l>
<l>Had once—But stop. <stage>[Pause.]</stage> To say that her dead marshal,</l>
<l>The father of this brave young lord, my client, <stage>[Pointing to CHAEONS.</stage></l>
<l>Honour'd his country's name by far-fam'd service,</l>
<l>Wou'd tax assertion, by a doubt undue.</l>
<l>You all, my lords, remember that so well,</l>
<l>'Twere injury to prove it.—In his life,</l>
<l>He grew indebted to these thrifty men; <stage>[Pointing to the creditors.</stage></l>
<l>And failing, by repeated loss in war,</l>
<l>Of power to free himself from such low claims;</l>
<l>I weep to tell it—But, his country sav'd,</l>
<l>Saw him imprison'd—and in prison die.</l>
<l>It is a maxim in our law—that debts</l>
<l>Die, with insolvent debtors: But these men,</l>
<l>Length'ning malicious pain beyond life's bounds,</l>
<l>From death snatch bodies for new chains.</l>
<l>They dare deny him ev'n his funeral rites;</l>
<l>Rites, not by heathens held from wretched slaves.</l>

<l>And she asleep too—and stand wisely doubting!</l>
<l>Go, and protect your fears within you night-gown;</l>
<l>Then safely fill your absent rival's place.</l>
<l>Darkness can tell no tales—if rapture does not:</l>
<l>If you must speak, take care you don't too soon;</l>
<l>Wise women know, mistakes once past are helpless.</l>

<l>But where's that sullen friend? Did he go with him?</l>

<l>No, no—The count's kind, undistrusting goodness,</l>

<speaker>FLORELLA.</speaker>
<l>What can be so to woman?—</l>
<l>Drown'd in due tears, and rack'd by strong despair,</l>

<l>She tore her hair, beat wild her beauteous bosom;</l>
<l>Curs'd ev'ry sleeping star, that watch'd not innocence;</l>
<l>Wounded the senseless floor with bleeding nails,</l>
<l>As if she plough'd up graves to cover shame.</l>
<l>Just in this tempest of ungovern'd rage,</l>
<l>In comes th' all-hushing husband; kiss'd her to stillness,</l>
<l>And every whirlwind's wing grew fledg'd with down;</l>
<l>Soft lent his head on her hard-heaving bosom,</l>
<l>While in an eager, doubt-dispell'd embrace,</l>
<l>He broke the chain of fear that held her dumb.</l>

<l>Sorry he was (and there the jest grew pang-full)</l>
<l>That, for two endless ages—two—long—nights!</l>
<l>He must, that moment, leave her. All the rest</l>
<l>I have already told you; and thus near her,</l>

<l>With unavailing flattery. Let vain youth</l>
<l>Taste false mens frothy praises—Age is wiser:</l>
<l>Age has experience in such fruitless wiles—</l>

<l>A wife—her husband absent,</l>

Nay, in the husband's night-dress—Yet all this,</l>
<l>Thy venal evidence (false maid!) calls innocence!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA FOY.</speaker>
<l>Pray, let her speak. My lord, you are a judge;</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CHALONS.</speaker>
<l>Nay, LA FOY;</l>
<l>Pity, thus forc'd, grows insult. I have told thee,</l>
<l>I heard her loud reproach confess the guilt,</l>
<l>To am'rous AUMELE, when kneeling by her bed.</l>
<l>She call'd him, cruel AUMELE—Bid him begone;</l>
<l>For, if he there was found, her name was blasted.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA FOY.</speaker>
<l>Away with such strain'd proofs. Had I myself</l>
<l>Been there, but on some far more honest purpose,</l>
<l>Poor soul! she might have said the same to me;</l>
<l>When blund'ring accident alone had brought me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALDORE.</speaker>
<l>I think, CHALONS, you said that AUMELE knelt</l>
<l>But near AMELIA's bed—Was it not more?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FLORELLA.</speaker>
<l>Had it been more—She still were innocent;</l>
<l>Unconscious of his coming. I alone</l>
<l>Was guilty. I (betray'd by bribe's profusion)</l>
<l>Admitted the deaf, head-strong, thoughtless lover,</l>
<l>Both to the house and chamber. I advis'd</l>
<l>The night-grown's needful cover. I gave notice</l>
<l>Of your wrong'd lordship's absence; taught him how</l>
<l>To personate your chanc'd return; soft whispering,</l>
<l>That if she wak'd not ere he reach'd her bed,</l>
<l>Whate'er succeeded, might be meant for you.</l>

<l>Now, now CHALONS! what now becomes of all</l>

<l>By heav'n! 'tis plain, to me, she wak'd too full</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>(By AARON HILL, <abbr><hi>Esq</hi></abbr>)</byline>
<stage>Spoke by AMELIA.</stage>
<lg>
<l>I'VE 'scap'd, to-night, two terrible disasters;</l>
<l>My honour's indignation—and my master's:</l>
<l>And heaven best knows what hapless hole can hide me,</l>
<l>If (to crown all my woes) your help's deny'd me.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>LADIES, you see how much expos'd our sex is;</l>
<l>Sleeping, or waking, some sad chance perplexes.</l>
<l>Man's a more wily snake than mother EVE's was;</l>
<l>In his own shape—and others too—deceives us.</l>
<l>Hungry devourer! never tir'd with snapping;</l>
<l>Shun him with open eyes—he'll catch us napping:</l>
<l>And how to 'scape him, if I know—ne'er let me</l>
<l>Break thro' th' entangling nets, that thus beset me.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now, GENTLEMEN, to your own thoughts appealing,</l>
<l>(Fitter, I doubt, for making wounds—than healing)</l>
<l>What wou'd you have poor women do with honour,</l>
<l>When danger heaps such monstrous loads upon her?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>D'ye think in conscience now—half-wak'd, half-weary</l>
<l>With foregone frights, for one's departed deary—</l>
<l>'Thad been so strange a crime—or worth such pother,</l>
<l>In darkness to mistake one dear for t'other?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Pray think on't—Put yourselves behind the curtain;</l>
<l>What can't be cur'd must be endur'd—that's certain.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="71"/>
<l>'Tis a fair question—and 'tis plainly ask'd ye;</l>
<l>Answer it—or confess, I've over-task'd ye.</l>
<l>Suppose me bound in sleep's soft, silken fetter,</l>
<l>And one of your dear selves the dark besetter:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Sight has no eyes, at midnight—and, for touches,</l>
<l>"JOAN," (says the proverb) "in the dark's a dutchess."</l>
<l>For my part—I can't find we've any senses,</l>
<l>Can furnish such attacks with fit defences.</l>
<l>Let trusty spouse, when business sends him packing,</l>
<l>("Safe bind safe find") leave no due caution lacking.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>I see some judge-like eyes, that look too sprightly</l>
<l>To miss a she law-point, put to 'em rightly.</l>
<l>Is mine the court's decree?—I humbly move it;</l>
<l>That, if your hearts affirm—your hands approve it.</l>
