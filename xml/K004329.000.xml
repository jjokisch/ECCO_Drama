<p>A TRAGEDY.</p>

<head>TO Sir <hi>John Philipps,</hi> Bart.</head>
<opener><salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the following Play comes into the World under some Disadvantage, I am happy in your Permission to shelter it under your Name.</p>
<p>BUT though it did not stand in need of your Favour and Patronage upon many Accounts; yet it should be remembred, that, in point of Propriety, you have an undoubted Right to these Sheets, whether you are considered as a Person sincerely attached to the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> or particularly interesting
<pb facs="3"/>
yourself in the Welfare of <hi>Pembroke-College;</hi> to the Regard and Affection of which Society you have a double Claim, both as an Ornament, and a Benefactor.</p>
<p>THE common Topics of Panegyric are obvious; and I have here a fair and agreeable Opportunity of taking Notice of those many amiable Qualities, which adorn you in public and private Life, and for which you are so justly beloved and esteemed: But my Inclination is corrected by a seasonable Thought, that most Writers of the present Age have, in this respect, a particular Advantage over me, as it is infinitely more easy to make a Character, than to describe one.</p>
<p>BESIDES, it would be needless to enter into a Detail of those Praises, which are already in the Mouth of every Wellwisher to his Country: But I cannot resist the Impulse of Gratitude, which points to that Part of your Character, which more immediately affects me;
<pb facs="4"/>
your Good-nature and Condescension, to which I am indebted for the Honour of your Acquaintance and Friendship, and for your favourable Acceptance of the following Poem.</p>
<p>GIVE me Leave to assure you, Sir, that if I am anxious for the Fate of this Tragedy, one principal Motive for it, is, the amusing Hope of transmitting to Posterity a Monument of the Regard and Veneration I have for the Person and Character of Sir JOHN PHILIPPS. I am,</p>
<closer><salute>SIR,</salute> 
<signed>Your much obliged, And most humble Servant,
WILLIAM HAWKINS.</signed>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THIS TRAGEDY having been offered to the Managers of <hi>Drury-Lane.</hi> Theatre, who declined accepting it, for Reasons which appeared to the Author to be rather evasive, than satisfactory, he thinks proper to submit it to the Judgment of the Public: And as he is not conscious of having had the least Intention to give Offence, and no particular Passage has been excepted against, he begs no other Prepossessions in its Favour, on this Account, than the reasonable Allowances of a candid and impartial Disposition. The Play has indeed received some considerable Alterations since it came from Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi>'s Hands: But, as these Alterations have no manner of Connexion with what the Author presumes was the principal Objection to the Whole (for, having had no clear Intimation, he can only speak by Conjecture), he does not think himself obliged to explain himself further on that Head.</p>

<l><seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F there is that some call Eternal Justice—</l>
<l>Let not the coward Thought perplex my Soul:</l>
<l>My Bosom entertains Two lordly Guests,</l>
<l>Strong-plum'd Ambition, and Hell-gender'd Lust:</l>
<l>The Voice of Conscience, 'gainst their wild Domain</l>
<l>Is but a Whisper to the Whirlwind's Blast.</l>
<l>HENRY PLANTAGENET has balk'd my Hopes;</l>
<l>I stand the Outcast of his Peevishness,</l>
<l>And disappointed Rival of his Love!</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="8"/>
But I have deeply laid my Plan of Vengeance:</l>
<l>I have been long young HARRY'S Oracle;</l>
<l>His shallow Friends walk in my Leading-strings:</l>
<l>If Fate give him the Crown, I'll bear the Rule,</l>
<l>And thro' the Gate of Pow'r shall find Access</l>
<l>To Love, and ROSAMOND. But see Lord SURRY.</l>

<stage>Enter Earl of <hi>SURRY.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SURRY.</speaker>
<l>My Lord of LEICESTER, hast thou seen the Prince?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<l>No. What of him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SURRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>O he is seeking thee:</l>
<l>Thou hast fast wedg'd thyself within his Heart;</l>
<l>He calls thee valiant, faithful, just, and good:</l>
<l>His greedy Ear devours thy Eloquence.</l>
<l>He now demeans himself as we could wish;</l>
<l>Talks of high Fame, and hardy Feats of Arms:</l>
<l>Thou hast inspir'd his Soul. He swears, the Crown,</l>
<l>Whose Glories fade on HENRY'S wither'd Head,</l>
<l>Would better flourish on his youthful Brow:</l>
<l>In troth he is a mettled Youth, my Lord,</l>
<l>And Nature meant him well.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Ay, or how else</l>
<l>Could we have taught him his own Worth, or ours;</l>
<l>Or hope to raise our Honours from the Dust?</l>
<l>Faint Hearts will call this Treason; but, my Lord,</l>
<l>'Tis injur'd Merit's Cause; and we will work</l>
<l>To turn the Current of our low-ebb'd Fortunes</l>
<l>Into a fuller Channel: But he comes,</l>
<l>And I have joyful Tidings for his Ear.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Prince <hi>HENRY,</hi> and Earl of <hi>WINCHESTER.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>P. HENRY.</speaker>
<l>Well, our good Friend, and trusty Counsellor,</l>
<l>What from our Uncle SCOTLAND?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>This, my Liege:</l>
<l>In Princely Terms he greets your Royal Highness,</l>
<l>And well approves th' Alliance you have offer'd:</l>
<l>But Words, so please your Grace, in forc'd Extent,</l>
<l>Are but the Texture of fine Rhetoric;</l>
<l>Plain Action is Sincerity's best Proof:</l>
<l>He has encamp'd his Troops on <hi>English</hi> Ground,</l>
<l>A peerless Force of Twenty thousand strong.</l>
<l>The Earl of <hi>Chester,</hi> with your Father's Powers,</l>
<l>Is in full March to meet him.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>P. HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Say, my Lord,</l>
<l>On what Pretence makes he this Armament?</l>
<l>For we must wait the Issue of a Battle,</l>
<l>Before we can avow ourself his Friend.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>His Claim's distinct from yours. He does demand</l>
<l>Full Restitution of the frontier Towns,</l>
<l>Your Father wrested from him in the Wars:</l>
<l>And thus he seems no Party in our Cause,</l>
<l>While we, as Time shall serve, may back his Quarrel.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>P. HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Why these are noble Tidings, and well suit</l>
<l>Our Royal Purpose. This looks well, my Lords:</l>
<l>I will no longer bend me to the Brow</l>
<l>Of this old King, my Father. LEICESTER, SURRY,</l>
<l>WINCHESTER, Friends, Companions of my Fortunes,</l>
<l>Give me your Hands, your Hearts, and, trust me, Lords,</l>
<l>We bravely shall outface these perilous Times,</l>
<l>Assisted by your Loves.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SURRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>My hasty Will</l>
<l>Is on the Wing, mocking Ability,</l>
<l>And Zeal outstrips Performance.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WINCHESTER.</speaker>
<l>And so, in Honesty of Heart, says WINCHESTER.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
<speaker>P. HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Thanks to you both: But, my good Lord of LEICESTER,</l>
<l>Are these same <hi>Scots,</hi> our new-contracted Friends,</l>
<l>Such as our Honour may lean safe upon?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Better ne'er mounted Glory's steep Ascent.</l>
<l>Sir, they are bold as the first Sons of Nature,</l>
<l>Ere Pomp and Luxury debauch'd the World:</l>
<l>Bred in a Land of Poverty and Want,</l>
<l>They live by free, uncultivated Virtue:</l>
<l>Ease were unnatural to their Iron Hearts;</l>
<l>For Labour is the Business of their Lives:</l>
<l>And, when they're summon'd forth to serve their Prince,</l>
<l>Dreadful they march, embody'd in the Field,</l>
<l>As the fell Storm, or Death-dispersing Bolt,</l>
<l>That rushes on, and levels all before it.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>P. HENRY.</speaker>
<l>'Tis good, and henceforth will we mould our Person</l>
<l>Into the Attitude of Majesty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WINCHESTER.</speaker>
<l>It fits your Highness well.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>P. HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Thou hast seen me, LEICESTER, in the Bloom of Youth,</l>
<l>Amidst the Joys of a voluptuous Court,</l>
<l>Where Folly spread her silken Net before me:</l>
<l>There soft'ning Beauty breath'd the am'rous Sigh;</l>
<l>There melting Music tun'd her Syren Voice,</l>
<l>And the high-flowing Bowl foam'd with rich Wines,</l>
<l>Soliciting ev'n Abstinence to taste:</l>
<l>Let me not turn my gallant Thought that Way,</l>
<l>When Virtue's balanc'd on so nice a Poise,</l>
<l>One Breath of Inclination turns the Scale.</l>
<l>Farewel for ever Pleasure's nerveless Tribe,</l>
<l>Welcome the manly Pomp of crimson War,</l>
<l>The Heaven-scaling Noise of charging Foes,</l>
<l>The piercing Groans of Bravery laid in Duft,</l>
<l>And all the Dangers, all the Sweets of Glory.</l>

<l>That he is Father to a Prince like you.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>P. HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Goto; he's weak, he's weak, and peevish, LEICESTER,</l>
<l>And yet 'tis current Conversation here,</l>
<l>That he hath well acquitted him in <hi>France</hi></l>
<l>To martial Chivalry.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SURRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>True it is, my Liege,</l>
<l>In open Field, he'as twice o'erthrown their Powers,</l>
<l>And now returns—</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>

<l>—Ay, like a Fugitive,</l>
<l>Rather than Conqueror; the doting Hero</l>
<l>Comes whining like an Infant for his Toy:</l>
<l>O he is worse than distaff'd <hi>Hercules!</hi></l>
<l>Where is the Honour of your <hi>Saxon</hi> House,</l>

<l>By the immortal Name</l>

<l>O give that noble Indignation Room!</l>
<l>Have you not Friends, and Justice on your Side?</l>
<l>Did we not all swear Fealty to your Highness,</l>
<l>Conven'd in full Assembly by your Father?</l>
<l>Or was it but a Shew of Majesty,</l>
<l>A solemn Farce of State for Boys to shout at?</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>Hold there—For ev'ry Word thy Love has utter'd,</l>
<l>Rebukes my tardy Soul—O 'tis most true,</l>
<l>As spiritless, and dull-temper'd as I seem,</l>
<l>This Head has born fair <hi>England</hi>'s Diadem:</l>
<l>You all remember 'twas at <hi>Winchester,</hi></l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="12"/>
In Presence of the States of the whole Realm,</l>
<l>The Royal Grant was made; when on this Brow</l>
<l>Rested th' Imperial Crown, which should confer</l>
<l>High Dignity, and Share of sov'reign Sway:</l>
<l>It was the free Donation of our Father.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>HENRY has sure forgotten him of late:</l>
<l>For then your Royal Highness may remember,</l>
<l>He well discharg'd an Office that became him.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>P. HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Ay, thou dost well remind me of it, LEICESTER;</l>
<l>'Twas at the sumptuous Banquet then prepar'd,</l>
<l>I sat inthron'd, the foremost of the Feast,</l>
<l>Lord of that glorious Day: 'Twas then my Father</l>
<l>Stept forth obsequious, like a Vassal-Prince,</l>
<l>Tending my Kingly Board; and sure, he cry'd,</l>
<l>No Monarch e'er was serv'd so honourably.</l>
<l>I whisper'd in his Ear his Grace of <hi>York,</hi></l>
<l>That, born a Prince, I thought me not much honour'd</l>
<l>By this same Ministry of that Duke's Son.</l>
<l>My Father was no better.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Nor is now,</l>
<l>But in our foolish Fears. Was that same Crown</l>
<l>You just now spoke of but a <hi>May-day</hi> Garland,</l>
<l>Bestow'd as on an Idiot, in mere Pastime?</l>
<l>Unnat'ral Insult! By the Blood that's in you,</l>
<l>If you have Hand, or Heart, or Sword, revenge,</l>
<l>Revenge yourself, your Country, and your Friends;</l>
<l>Your Friends for you dishonour'd, slighted, scorn'd;</l>
<l>Your Country soften'd by effeminate Rule;</l>
<l>Yourself the stalking Shadow of a King.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>P. HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Enough, my tow'ring Fancy grasps the Skies:</l>
<l>Hence, give the Word to Fate; gird on my Sword:</l>
<l>Thou faithful Guardian of my wav'ring Youth,</l>
<l>I'll go where thou and Honour point the Way.</l>
<l>Where are these trusty <hi>Scots?</hi> Quick let us join them;</l>

<l>And pour my Vengeance on this Parent-Foe.</l>

<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Well said; but I must cool this burning Vein,</l>
<l>Or this mad Youth will hurry us to Ruin. <stage>[Aside.</stage></l>
<l>I meant not this: I pray your Grace be calm.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>P. HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Yes, as the Sea, that quarrels with the Wind!</l>
<l>Who is't can tame the hungry Panther's Rage?</l>
<l>Glory has still an Appetite more keen:</l>
<l>HARRY contends not for a vulgar Prize;</l>
<l>It is a Crown: Repeat it to the Heavens,</l>
<l>With the big Mouth of War; It is a Crown:</l>
<l>O you should rush like Lightning from my Presence,</l>
<l>And boldly pluck it from the Tyrant's Brow.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Your Highness knows our Hearts and Duty yours:</l>
<l>But Zeal thus premature were worse than Treason:</l>
<l>Our growing Cause is yet too young, to combat</l>
<l>With this tempestuous Time: If Fortune bless</l>
<l>Our good Allies with Victory, the Crown</l>
<l>Is yours by Cov'nant, and your Right proclaim'd</l>
<l>By <hi>Scotland</hi>'s King: Till when lie we in secret,</l>
<l>Like the unseen insinuating Flame,</l>
<l>That creeps while it destroys: Without this Caution,</l>
<l>We are not safe an Hour—Your Father comes,</l>
<l>And you're withdrawn from Court—Hah! how sounds that?</l>

<l>As I love Honour, I do fear him not.</l>

<l>Breathes on our Counsel, it takes Root the deeper.</l>

<l>What wouldst thou urge me to?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Come, come, my Lord,</l>
<l>You must yourself to Court to meet the King;</l>
<l>And, when he questions you of your Departure,</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="14"/>
Be you not too submissive, nor too high:</l>
<l>We can find Reasons plausible enough</l>
<l>Besides this Disaffection—as—d'ye mark—</l>

<l>Let me do Justice to the Man has wrong'd me:</l>
<l>My Lord of SALISBURY, from his Dawn of Youth,</l>
<l>I trac'd the Symptoms of an active Soul,</l>
<l>Suited for warlike Deeds and brave Atchievements:</l>
<l>But then his turbulent Passions work so strong,</l>
<l>His Character is ever an Extreme;</l>
<l>A Hero, or a Dotard in Excess;</l>
<l>This Day, with a deep Sense of Honour stung,</l>
<l>Half-Convert to fair Virtue; and the next,</l>
<l>Born by fierce Appetite, a Slave to Vice.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>His gen'rous Temper one Day may prevail;</l>
<l>For Fate still throws Occasion in his Way,</l>
<l>To put his noble Qualities to Proof:</l>
<l>An unexpected Tempest from the North</l>
<l>Hangs low'ring o'er his Head; and the young Prince,</l>
<l>Who breathes a mighty and right Royal Spirit,</l>
<l>Has with some noble Followers left the Court.</l>

<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>He is ensnar'd by guileful LEICESTER'S Art:</l>
<l>The King, thou know'st, hath banish'd him his Presence,</l>
<l>He meditates Revenge in all its Venom;</l>
<l>And since arose the League 'twixt him and HARRY.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<l>Report has said this Lord, on Terms of Honour,</l>
<l>Woo'd your fair Daughter's Love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>He did profess so;</l>
<l>But much I fear me with a vile Design;</l>
<l>And for full Satisfaction, but this Day</l>
<l>I've penn'd a Note, in female Characters,</l>
<l>As from my Daughter, full of Blandishments,</l>
<l>And cordial Invitations from her Love:</l>
<l>If I surprise him at the Place assign'd,</l>
<l>I shall detect his Baseness to his Face.</l>
<l>Perhaps I but transcribe the Sentiments</l>
<l>Of her abandon'd Heart—that as it may.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Think not too meanly of thy beauteous Daughter;</l>
<l>HENRY 'tis true engrosses all her Soul,</l>
<l>Yet in her lonely, solitary Hours,</l>
<l>Sad, she regrets her ruin'd Innocence,</l>
<l>And mourns, like the first Fair, her fallen State.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>'Tis superficial Grief: a barren Soil</l>
<l>Where Reformation never can take Root:</l>
<l>O, that an only Child should be a Curse!</l>
<l>But let us hence, the Thought encroaches on me,</l>
<l>In Pity to myself I would divert it.</l>

<speaker>HARRIANA.</speaker>
<l>This Coolness is untimely.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>HARRIANA,</l>
<l>Th' unpleasing Thought will sometimes steal upon me:</l>
<l>Great as they seem, all these are dear-bought Pleasures:</l>
<l>Ev'n HENRY'S Love has cost me many a Pang.</l>
<l>Peace is the glorious Privilege of Virtue.</l>
<l>The harmless Country Maid, that lives retir'd,</l>
<l>Beneath the Covert of a homely Hut,</l>
<l>And knows no View beyond her daily Bread,</l>
<l>Has more Heart's Ease than I.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARRIANA.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Prepost'rous Melancholy!</l>
<l>Is not the World, and its first Master, yours?</l>
<l>Nature, thy Handmaid, still supplies thy Wishes,</l>
<l>Lavish of all her Stock, as who should say,</l>
<l>Thou shalt be happy.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>These are mean Suggestions:</l>
<l>Know I ne'er sold my Virtue, but to Love:</l>
<l>The massy Store of the Wealth-pregnant Earth,</l>
<l>The Pomp, and Eye-attracting Blaze of Courts,</l>
<l>And all the gilded Baits of Female Pride,</l>
<l>Were Bribes my HENRY'S Love disdain'd to offer:</l>
<l>Such as it is, this Beauty won his Heart,</l>
<l>How he won mine—I know not—but he won it—</l>
<l>For him I threw away my Innocence,</l>
<l>And am the Scoff of every scornful Tongue:</l>
<l>For him I've stain'd the noble Name of CLIFFORD,</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="18"/>
And pierc'd his aged Soul who gave me Being;</l>
<l>For him, e'en now, my Heart with Transport beats;</l>
<l>His Presence ever calms my troubled Breast,</l>
<l>Stills each dull Thought, and bids all Sorrow vanish.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARRIANA.</speaker>
<l>Once more he comes victorious from the Field:</l>
<l>O meet him with thy Love's sincerest Welcome.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Yes, he returns, and Thought adieu for ever:</l>
<l>Hence, I defy that Tyrant of the Mind:</l>
<l>My Love wants not a Plea: HENRY my Lord</l>
<l>Is great and gen'rous: He's the Pride of Fame,</l>
<l>And Fortune's Darling: HENRY lulls my Soul</l>
<l>In soft unfelt Captivity.</l>

<l>And pour my Soul in Transports out before thee.</l>
<l>What, what is Fame, or Victory, to this?</l>

<l>Speak not my Eyes the Language of my Heart?</l>
<l>Or shall I open my rich Hoard of Fondness,</l>
<l>With all the soft Impertinence of Love?</l>
<l>Why has my Lord so long been absent from me?</l>
<l>Methinks I now receive thee in thy Tent,</l>
<l>Dreadfully graceful from the Field of Blood,</l>
<l>The manly Dew still reeking on thy Brow.</l>

<l>And bid him sheath the Sword for Love of me.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>K.</hi> HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>To thee I am devoted from this Hour:</l>
<l>I'll give Mankind my loose superfluous Moments,</l>
<l>But Love shall claim my more substantial Care.</l>
<l>No petty Monarchs shall divide us more:</l>
<l><hi>France</hi> and her King have felt the Wrath of HARRY.</l>
<l>I flew on Wings of Victory to War,</l>
<l>And like celestial Fire consum'd the Foe;</l>
<l>Then halted in the mid Career of Glory:</l>
<l>Conquest was Waste of Time: Quick I return'd,</l>
<l>And left the Business of the World unfinish'd.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Forgive me, HENRY, if I shed a Tear;</l>
<l>A Tear, at once, of Pity, and of Love.</l>
<l>Gaze not thus fondly on me whilst I speak:</l>
<l>It is a fatal Fondness, and betrays thee.</l>
<l>Possess'd of me, art thou not lost to Honour?</l>
<l>Where is the native Greatness of thy Soul?</l>
<l>Thy gen'rous Thirst of everlasting Glory?</l>
<l>O hadst thou never fix'd thine Eyes on me,</l>
<l><hi>Fame,</hi> on her brazen Tablet, had display'd</l>
<l>Thy Royal Name, and shewn it to the Stars.</l>
<l>But I shall blot thy Memory for ever.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>K.</hi> HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Thy kind Concern is far too nice, my Love:</l>
<l>O ROSAMOND! 'tis but the Dream of Pride:</l>
<l>Kings, and their Subjects all, are Nature's Children;</l>
<l><pb n="14" facs="20"/>
And ermin'd Greatness on the Throne must own it.</l>
<l>What is the Monarch more than other Men?</l>
<l>His Appetites and Passions are the same;</l>
<l>He hates, revenges, hopes, and fears, as they do;</l>
<l>Or does he love, O does he love like me,</l>
<l>'Tis Glory, 'tis Ambition, to pursue</l>
<l>The heav'nly Fair, and win her to his Wishes.</l>
<l>Is it not Pride to hang upon thy Smiles?</l>
<l>Is it not Triumph to enfold thee thus?</l>
<l>Art thou not All, and is not this World Nothing?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>I could for ever listen to thy Voice:</l>
<l>Whene'er thou speak'st, Reason gives up the Cause,</l>
<l>And Nature whispers, what thou say'st is right.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>K.</hi> HENRY.</speaker>
<l>Be Love the Theme, and I could talk for ever.</l>

<l>Be Love the Theme, I could for ever hear thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>K.</hi> HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>O come, my rural Goddess, to my Arms:</l>
<l>We'll lie upon the Flow'r-enamell'd Turf;</l>
<l>The Garland-Wreath shall be our Diadem;</l>
<l>The Leaf-clad Bow'r our Canopy of State;</l>
<l>Our Music the sweet Matin of the Lark:</l>
<l>Then bless me with the Sunshine of thy Beauty,</l>
<l>Till I forget my Royal Occupation,</l>
<l>The Task of Greatness, and the Toil of Power,</l>
<l>And ev'ry Sense be full of Love and thee.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>How does thy Language charm my list'ning Ears?</l>
<l>Yet must I dread this Indolence of Thought,</l>
<l>The <hi>Scotchmen,</hi> and their King, are up in Arms;</l>
<l>And, if Report say true, th' Invasion boasts</l>
<l>The Countenance of your Son.</l>

<speaker><hi>K.</hi> HENRY.</speaker>

<l>Fear not, my Love:</l>

O lead me to some peaceful, close Retreat,</l>
<l>Where all is calm and gentle as thy Breast.</l>
<l>Let hostile War advance, and Faction rage,</l>
<l>I will not deign to give Mankind a Look,</l>
<l>But safely rest within thy faithful Arms.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>So, when the Pilgrim views the Storm arise,</l>
<l>To the kind Shelter of some Grot he flies,</l>
<l>And in that sweet Recess securely lies.</l>
<l>Fearless he hears the dreadful Tempests roar,</l>
<l>And madding Ocean bursting on the Shore;</l>
<l>The Heav'ns in vain their flaming Terrors spread,</l>
<l>And Thunders roll unheeded o'er his Head.</l>

<l>Why didst thou teach me 'twas a pleasing Name,</l>
<l>Importing Peace, and Harmony, and Joy?</l>
<l>You lov'd me, when you made me what I am;</l>
<l>And yet you lov'd me but to make me wretched.</l>

<l>Does it displease thee to behold me thus?</l>

<l>Did HENRY leave the Court? Not so, my Liege;</l>
<l>For HENRY left a Brothel, not a Court:</l>
<l>Loose Riot and Intemperance dwelt there,</l>
<l>Soft-seated Indolence, and Female Foppery,</l>
<l>And pamper'd Jollity, with full-blown Cheeks,</l>
<l>Keeping high Festival, and Jubilee.</l>
<l>Was it for me to trust my Spring of Youth,</l>
<l>That takes Impression like the yielding Wax,</l>
<l>With such licentious Characters as these?</l>
<l>Was it for me, to sink in Luxury,</l>
<l>To see a dimpled Harlot's wanton Reign,</l>
<l>While, banish'd from your House, your Board, your Bed,</l>
<l>The best of Women languish'd Time away,</l>
<l>At once a Widow, and at once a Wife?</l>
<l>I saw her Griefs, I heard her just Complaints,</l>
<l><pb n="22" facs="28"/>
I left, by her Advice, th'unhallow'd Roof,</l>
<l>Lest I should seem to abet the Injury,</l>
<l>And triumph o'er the Woes of her that bore me.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>K.</hi> HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Woman has not her Match on this Side Hell:</l>
<l>Fool! to believe a scorn'd, abandon'd Wife</l>
<l>Less subtle, or malicious, than the Devil:</l>
<l>Is this the praying, dying ELINOR!</l>
<l>Curse on thy fawning, Honey-steep'd Deceit!</l>
<l>What! dost Thou practise with my secret Foes</l>

<l>Wilt thou, thou rash, hard-hearted Youth, undo me?</l>

<l>And save thy Mother's Name from foul Dishonour.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>K.</hi> HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>It is too late—I see confed'rate Mischief,</l>
<l>This stripling Traytor has betray'd thy Counsel:</l>
<l>Thee I had long since hated, now despise.</l>
<l>For you, our sometime Son, but that I scorn</l>
<l>To waste a Thought upon thee, I could humble</l>
<l>That lofty Spirit, till its fallen Crest</l>
<l>Should crouch, and offer Homage to the Dust.</l>
<l>But Majesty is fenc'd with Adamant,</l>
<l>Proof against Treason's Darts, that but recoil,</l>
<l>And mock the Force that threw them.—It is thus</l>
<l>The Ocean does but fret upon the Strand,</l>
<l>And the Storm breathes against the deep-bas'd Tow'r.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Will it avail me to appeal to Heav'n?</l>
<l>O may its choicest Stores of Wrath consume me,</l>

<l>He has abus'd thee with a well-feign'd Tale,</l>
<l>Screening some dreadful Purpose.</l>
</lg>
</sp>

<lg>
<l>Peace, I say.</l>

<l>Full-sated Sense rebukes it.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>O my Son,</l>
<l>The Pain thou gav'st me once, was Ease to this:</l>
<l>Why was thy Birth-day hail'd with general Joy?</l>
<l>Why did I bless the Sun that saw thee first?</l>
<l>Why did I fondly rear thy feeble Age?</l>
<l>Is thy Heart Flint? O yet unweave thy Craft,</l>

<l>The guardian Pow'rs that shield the Lives of Princes,</l>
<l>That not in pers'nal Pique, or private Grudge,</l>
<l>Or Peevishness of Appetite restrain'd,</l>
<l>Or the wild Policy of high Ambition,</l>
<l>I sought this Breach; but in an honest View</l>
<l>Of Duty to a Mother's just Request,</l>

<l>Most unsuspected, as unnatural,</l>
<l>Spreading its Poison ev'n within my Walls,</l>
<l>Insulting in the sacred Name of Justice▪</l>
<l>Or stabbing with the smiling Look of Love;</l>
<l><pb n="24" facs="30"/>
This grinds my Thought—Now let Confusion reign,</l>
<l>All Order and Relation be dissolv'd:</l>
<l>And thou, O Nature, turn aside thy Face,</l>
<l>Crimson'd with Blushes—All my firm Resolves</l>
<l>Are brittle now, and Patience turns a Fury.</l>
<l>Who's there? Our Loving Wife, and Loyal Son!</l>

<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Thy loving Wife, but most disloyal Son</l>
<l>To me, and thee: Let me appeal, my Lord,</l>
<l>To the fair Judgment of your former Love.</l>
<l>Did I not ever make your Will my Law?</l>
<l>Was I deceitful, treach'rous, artful, then?</l>
<l>'Tis true, my Wrongs are great: but sure no Wrongs</l>
<l>Can alter Nature, or invert the Mind:</l>
<l>My Wrongs call for Revenge; but sure a Queen</l>
<l>Could well revenge a nobler Way than this.</l>

<l>We're Men, but yet no Members of Mankind:</l>
<l>This Monastery is to us, our World;</l>
<l>Yon melancholy Cells thou seest, our Home;</l>
<l>There ev'ry Night, in pensive Meditation,</l>
<l>We watch the Lamp's dull Gleam; and when we sleep,</l>

<l><pb n="34" facs="40"/>
Till the shrill Cock, the Usher of the Morn,</l>
<l>Awakes us to the Discipline of Day.</l>
<l>Our homely Meals are low, and regular;</l>
<l>And while we stay the Rage of Appetite,</l>
<l>We starve the dainty Palate: To be brief,</l>
<l>Wealth, Business, Pleasure, Honour we renounce,</l>
<l>And all of us are Wretches, by Engagement:</l>

<l>Your Ignorance;</l>

<l>All this is Happiness, to what I suffer:</l>

<l>Poor tho' he is, the Man whose Mind's at Ease,</l>

<l>O she was once the Treasure of my Soul;</l>

<l>And spotless as the white-rob'd Angels are:</l>
<l>Whene'er I taught her Honour's sacred Law,</l>
<l>Her still Attention, and obsequious Look,</l>
<l>Seem'd the Certificates of inborn Virtue:</l>
<l>Sometimes I've trac'd her Mother in her Face,</l>

<l>And travel o'er Youth's chearful Road again.</l>
<l>For her I left the Business of the Field,</l>
<l>Well-pleas'd I toil'd a rural Life away,</l>
<l>And, joyful, saw my golden Harvests rise:</l>
<l>But Plenty, Peace, and Comfort, are no more;</l>
<l>Her coward Virtue stoop'd to brutal Love.</l>
<l>I could not bear the Shame: I left my House;</l>
<l>The Fugitive of Choice, and not of Fortune:</l>
<l>Sick of this worthless World, at length I sought</l>
<l><pb n="36" facs="42"/>

<l>Let not the QUEEN distrust</l>
<l>These Means of good Success: I've wish'd long since,</l>

<l>Good Even to my Lord. You seem'd in Thought.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>In Faith, my good Lord CLIFFORD, so I was.</l>
<l>I have some certain Smatch of Poesy,</l>
<l>And, walking forth to taste the Ev'ning's Freshness,</l>
<l>My Wit 'gan to be somewhat humoursome:</l>
<l>I fear your Lordship has quite marr'd my Sonnet.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>What, does the Paper you just folded up</l>
<l>Contain the Substance?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>A short Sketch, my Lord,</l>
<l>My Muse in Miniature; a very Trifle.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Say, LEICESTER, is't a Time to trifle now?</l>
<l>Peace to thy Heart, I think the Season's sickly.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<l>Why, so do I; and, trust me, noble CLIFFORD,</l>
<l>'Tis but to cheat away my Melancholy,</l>
<l>I sometimes condescend to be a Fool.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>O I could be a Fool, or ev'n a Knave;</l>
<l>Could rank me with the common savage Crew,</l>
<l>Turn Hireling, drudging Slave, and carry Burdens,</l>
<l>And feed on scanty Scraps with Dogs on Dunghils,</l>
<l>If I could purchase, with this Sum of Misery,</l>
<l>My wonted Peace of Mind. Sure I'm so wretched,</l>
<l>Fate fix'd me for its Masterpiece of Malice.</l>

<lg>
<l>Great are thy Wrongs indeed: Yet we all suffer;</l>
<l>'Tis epidemical, this State Disorder.</l>

<l>That I could bear a Thousand gross Affronts,</l>
<l>That stink ev'n to the Sun, before the Guile</l>
<l>Of artful Villainy, that lurks unseen,</l>
<l>And ruins while it smiles.</l>
</lg>

<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Ev'n so, good CLIFFORD:</l>
<l>Sure a clandestine Traitor is the vilest:</l>
<l>The Devil's most odious Quality is his Cunning:</l>
<l>Let us not think your Lordship has such Foes:</l>
<l>Mean time make use of me, and my Soul's Friendship.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Hah, LEICESTER, dost thou know what Friendship is?</l>
<l>'Tis not the fawning Cringe, the study'd Smile,</l>
<l>The honey-dropping Speech, or solemn Vow;</l>
<l>It is a sacred Ray of heav'nly Love:</l>
<l>Like that, rejoicing in the Good of others,</l>
<l>It scorns the narrow Bounds of Selfishness,</l>
<l>And knows no Bliss sincere, but social Joy:</l>
<l>Simple and plain, it shines in naked Truth,</l>
<l>And opens all the Sluices of the Heart.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>
<l>What means all this?</l>

<l>Distrust is Friendship's Canker.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>

<speaker>LEICESTER.</speaker>

<l>That, as your Lordship thinks. For my own Part,</l>
<l>I know the Man will thank me for my Service;</l>
<l>And so Good-night.</l>

<l>—For you, my Lord; but for this last black Deed,</l>

<l>It had been Cowardice to rush on Death,</l>
<l>When Fate had other Mischiefs in Reserve;</l>
<l>Else my own Hands had freed me from the World,</l>
<l>And HENRY'S idle Spleen: But let him know</l>
<l>I dare defy the utmost of his Power:</l>
<l>Come Death, come Hell, I will be LEICESTER still.</l>

<lg>
<l>Away! I was not born to know Distress;</l>
<l>My Soul, high-tow'ring on her full-fledg'd Wing,</l>
<l>And independent on Contingency,</l>
<l>Hears Fortune's air-spent Arrows hiss beneath her:</l>
<l>Defeated, I still boast in my vast Purpose:</l>
<l>I play'd a dang'rous, but a noble Game:</l>
<l>'Twas Fortitude to venture Life for Glory;</l>
<l>And, next to that, 'tis Fortitude to die.—</l>
<l>I have but one Request to make—your Leave</l>
<l>To see the Prince.</l>

<l>I have no Orders to refuse you that.</l>
</sp>

<lg>
<l>Yet for one Moment my tough Heart must bend,</l>
<l>And Nature shock'd confess a transient Pang:</l>
<l>The Dream of Bliss now swims before my Eyes.</l>
<l>Fortune had plac'd my Happiness in View;</l>
<l>And, when I rush'd to grasp the solid Joy,</l>
<l>She marr'd my Hopes, and dash'd them to the Ground.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The Merchant thus the wish'd-for Haven sees,</l>
<l>And chears his Soul with Hopes of future Ease:</l>
<l>But, unforeseen, the threat'ning Tempests rise,</l>
<l>And Clouds black-lowring gather in the Skies;</l>
<l>Winds roar, Seas swell, his shatter'd Bark is tost,</l>
<l>And, in a sudden Wreck, his Mass of Wealth is lost.</l>

<l>It is Society, that makes Sin pleasing:</l>
<l>Lead-pinion'd Slumber weighs upon the Sense;</l>
<l>But wakeful Conscience knows no Hour of Rest,</l>
<l>And the clos'd Eye-lid cannot shut out Care.</l>

<l>Stand you without, and wait our Word of Fate.</l>

</lg>

<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Thus self-condemn'd, how shall I plead for Pardon?</l>
<l>Or stand before offended Majesty?</l>
<l>Yet Heav'n accepts, in Part of due Atonement,</l>
<l>Confession of the Crime: Here on my Knees—</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Call'st thou it Merit, to confess a Crime,</l>
<l>Thou dar'st no more deny, than vindicate?</l>
<l>Strive not in vain to deprecate my Wrath:</l>
<l>Think on the Anguish of an injur'd Wife;</l>
<l>Think on the Torture of a slighted Lover;</l>
<l>Think on the Hatred of a pow'rful Rival;</l>
<l>Think on all these; and think on Death.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>O, rather,</l>
<l>Think on the Horror of a Wretch, that stands</l>
<l>Upon the Brink of Death, but dares not die.</l>
<l>My Soul is startled at the View of Death,</l>
<l>And ev'ry Weakness takes the sad Alarm.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Art thou afraid to die? I'd have thee so:</l>
<l>'Tis Joy to antedate thy Misery:</l>
<l>To suff'ring Virtue Death's a Remedy;</l>
<l>To Guilt, like thine, alone, a Punishment.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Great Queen, relent, and spare my Bloom of Youth.</l>
<l>Compassion on Distress is great, and noble;</l>
<l>But, undeserv'd, 'tis godlike: O, remember,</l>
<l>Mercy's the shining Attribute of Heav'n;</l>
<l>'Twill sooth thee in thy last sad Hour to think,</l>
<l>Thou didst not plunge me into endless Ruin:</l>
<l><pb n="48" facs="54"/>
And when thou mountest to thy native Sky,</l>
<l>Admiring Angels shall come crouding round thee,</l>
<l>And own that thou, of all the Race of Men,</l>
<l>Hast copy'd best thy bright Original.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Think not to whine me from my firm Resolve:</l>
<l>Can a Sigh cool the Sun's meridian Blaze?</l>
<l>Or a Tear quench the Rage of spreading Flames?</l>
<l>Then may this Shew of artificial Grief,</l>
<l>Of forc'd Remorse, appease my angry Soul.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>'Tis not in Art to mimic Grief like mine:</l>
<l>Let me conjure thee, as thou art a Woman,</l>
<l>By all the natural Softness of our Sex,</l>
<l>Not in wild Haste to dye thy Hands in Blood.</l>
<l>Much have I sinn'd indeed. If Love's a Sin,</l>
<l>That Sin in every Circumstance was Love:</l>
<l>Who knows not female Passions lordly Rule,</l>
<l>Impatient ever of cool Judgment's Sway?</l>
<l>Disgrace, Confusion, Ruin, Rage, and Death,</l>
<l>Are Arguments to Reason, not to Love:</l>
<l>A Woman's Weakness claims a Woman's Pity.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>A Rival's Joys demand a Rival's Hate:</l>
<l>If female Passions sway with lordly Rule,</l>
<l>Revenge may glow with Fires as hot as Lust.</l>
<l>Shall I forgive thee, and destroy myself?</l>
<l>What, let thee live to triumph o'er my Folly,</l>
<l>Again to riot in my HENRY'S Arms,</l>
<l>And in each Fit of wanton Dalliance,</l>
<l>To lisp, and prattle o'er, the dismal Tale;</l>
<l>Then kiss, and make him swear, 'Tis pitiful?</l>
<l>By Heav'n it makes Imagination mad.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Witness the Pow'r supreme, that sees my Shame,</l>
<l>I here renounce for ever HENRY'S Love;</l>
<l>Tho' Life itself would thus be dearly bought:</l>
<l>But I've a fearful Reck'ning yet to make,</l>
<l><pb n="49" facs="55"/>
Much from my Soul is due to injur'd Heav'n;</l>
<l>Will these few Pangs discharge the Debt, or will</l>
<l>A Moment's Sorrow pay for Years of Guilt?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<l>That as Heav'n pleases; but my Anger's urgent,</l>
<l>And now demands an instant Sacrifice.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Let me but live: Is that so great a Boon?</l>
<l>I'll wander in the World a Vagabond,</l>
<l>Turn'd loose from Human-kind, forlorn, and wild;</l>
<l>Each scornful Tongue, that hail'd my happier Days,</l>
<l>Shall mock my abject Fall: I'll owe my Life</l>
<l>To common Charity; from Door to Door</l>
<l>I'll beg Subsistence, and be proud to feast</l>
<l>Upon the Refuse of gorg'd Appetite.</l>
<l>And when the Wrath of Heav'n is satisfy'd,</l>
<l>And the full Term of all my Woes expires,</l>
<l>On the cold Flint I'll stretch my weary'd Limbs,</l>
<l>And bless thy Name, and die.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Shame of thy Sex,</l>
<l>Whom can thy Blessings help, or Curses hurt?</l>
<l>Why do I trifle thus? It is resolv'd:</l>
<l>Inexorable Justice claims her Right.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<l>'Tis Cruelty, not Justice, thirsts for Blood.</l>

<l>I tell thee, SURRY, there's no Faith in Nature.</l>
<l>I'd ride a Bulrush in a stormy Sea,</l>
<l>Ere I would trust a Friend: Ingratitude!</l>
<l>Thou damning Sin of Devils, and of Men!</l>
<l>Our Patriarch-Father, happy in himself,</l>
<l>Enjoy'd his solitary Paradise:</l>
<l>But his first Bosom-friend, his Wife, betray'd him.</l>

<l>My Soul abhors the Falshood of that Traitor:</l>
<l>For me—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>P.</hi> HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Heav'n only knows how much I lov'd him:</l>
<l>He lay within my Bosom's closest Fold,</l>
<l>And saw the Springs that mov'd my Soul to Action:</l>
<l>Had one poor Morsel been my Life's Subsistence,</l>
<l>And LEICESTER'S craving Appetite unsated,</l>
<l>He should have shar'd his precious Moiety</l>
<l>Exact, even to a breath-light Atom's Weight.</l>
<l>Is this the Man that has abus'd me thus?</l>
<l>The brute Beast softens to good Offices:</l>
<l>The churlish Cur frisks at his Master's Feet:</l>
<l>Nay, the great Lion fondles with his Keeper,</l>
<l>And bloody Tygers lick the Hand that feeds them:</l>
<l>Man only of all Creatures is ungrateful.</l>
<l>Heav'n too but wastes its Bounty on the Wretch:</l>
<l>Why sheds yon golden Orb his daily Light?</l>
<l>Mark! his meridian Brightness glares unheeded</l>
<l>By thankless Mortals, like a common Meteor.</l>

While Plenty smil'd along my fruitful Shores:</l>
<l>But now Heav'n's scorching Wrath has choak'd my Springs;</l>

<l>Some Precedent of Horror yet unheard-of.</l>
<l>Would I could conjure up a hellish Spirit,</l>
<l>Should rend asunder this Sea-mantled Isle!</l>

<l>The chosen Instrument of Knavery,</l>
<l>Still pliant to a Villain's forming Hand?</l>
<l>And am I but a Dupe to such a Wretch?</l>
<l>Impartial Fame, that registers all Deeds,</l>
<l>Will write this first Page of my History,</l>
<l>In Terms most vile, and insignificant:</l>
<l>Had I the nervous Arms of HERCULES,</l>
<l>The ample Sway of PHILIP'S conqu'ring Son,</l>
<l>Proud CAESAR'S Fortune, or great ARTHUR'S Soul,</l>
<l>HARRY, and Fool, would still be join'd together.</l>

<l>Who rules too, rules o'er Men; and I'd not hold</l>
<l>All Earth upon Security precarious,</l>

<l>Let the vile Miscreants prey on one another;</l>

<l>How happy is the Sage, in his Retreat,</l>
<l>That human Footsteps never yet profan'd!</l>
<l>No jarring Passions vex his gentle Breast;</l>
<l>Peace crowns his Days, his Nights unbroken Rest;</l>
<l>Slave to no Int'rest, aiming at no End,</l>
<l>He neither fears a Foe, nor wants a Friend;</l>
<l>Careless, what Nations rise, what Empires fall,</l>

<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>SEE where she lies asleep; poor fallen Cherub!</l>
<l>The maiden Freshness of th'ungather'd Rose</l>
<l>But imitates that Sweetness: Fair to look on,</l>
<l>Why art thou all Deformity within?</l>
<l>Oh! how unhappy is the Fate of Beauty?</l>
<l>It tempts the Ruffian Hand of Violence,</l>
<l>And, like the Diamond, sparkling in the Mine,</l>
<l>With its own Lustre lights the greedy Spoiler.</l>
<l>O ROSAMOND! had but indulgent Heav'n</l>
<l>Blasted the early Spring of thy Perfections,</l>
<l>'Tis like, thy Life had been as innocent,</l>
<l>As that same guiltless Slumber—But she wakes.</l>
<l>I'll stand awhile apart.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Have Mercy on me!—</l>
<l>My Fears confound me—This sad Dwelling seems</l>
<l>The Anti-chamber to eternal Darkness:</l>
<l>They left me here to dreadful Meditation,</l>
<l>And weary'd Nature since has sunk in Sleep:</l>
<l>Am I to live? Why then that Ceremony,</l>
<l>That dismal Pomp of Death? Or do they mock me,</l>
<l>Staying the Execution of my Fate,</l>
<l>To fright my Apprehension?—Hah! Who's there?</l>
<l>It is my Father's Friend, the good Lord SALISBURY.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>O ROSAMOND! I come—But I must weep first—</l>

<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Weep Blood, my Heart, for ev'ry Tear he sheds:</l>
<l>Dost thou behold me with a tender Eye,</l>
<l>Thou that dost Honour to the House of CLIFFORD,</l>
<l>While I, vile Wretch! was born but to disgrace it?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Believe me, Fair-one, these same falling Tears</l>
<l>Adorn thee more than Beauty's brightest Bloom.</l>
<l>'Twas That betray'd thee to eternal Shame,</l>
<l>And dy'd thy Soul in complicated Guilt;</l>
<l>But Tears shall wash the scarlet Stains away.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Thy charitable Care, and mild Address,</l>
<l>Bespeak my warmest Thanks—Say, my good Lord,</l>
<l>Where is my injur'd Father? May I hope</l>
<l>(For once I knew him of a gentle Nature)</l>
<l>He can have Pity on an only Child,</l>
<l>Wretched, and sad, as Sin and Shame can make her:</l>
<l>For oh!—Despair will sink me, if I die</l>
<l>Beneath the Terrors of his righteous Curse.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>There yet remains a dismal Tale to tell:</l>
<l>Alas! my Friend thy Father is no more;</l>
<l>But Yesterday he dy'd by LEICESTER'S Hand.</l>
<l>In his last Moments he remembred Thee</l>
<l>(Think it an Earnest of forgiving Heav'n):</l>
<l>He own'd his Daughter in that fatal Crisis,</l>
<l>And bless'd thee with the Fervency of Pray'r.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>This was my Deed: I kill'd this best of Fathers;</l>
<l>I drove his hoary Age to Desperation,</l>
<l>And made his Being painful—So is mine—</l>
<l>For I am now a Burden to myself—</l>
<l>Yet he forgave me—Ponder that, my Soul;</l>
<l>'Tis growing Matter for eternal Thought—</l>
<l>My Lord, thou know'st my Doom. Am I to die?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>You must prepare to live: Last Night the Queen,</l>
<l><pb n="61" facs="67"/>
But hypocritical in Cruelty,</l>
<l>Beneath the Mask of Vengeance meant thee Mercy:</l>
<l>That dreadful Guard, that bore thee from the Palace,</l>
<l>As to thy Fate, when they convey'd thee hither,</l>
<l>Fulfill'd their whole Commission: In this Convent</l>
<l>Thou must commence the Votary of Heav'n,</l>
<l>And bid Adieu to all the World for ever.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Confess, my Heart, the Hand of Providence,</l>
<l>Plain, tho' unseen, in all its Acts of Mercy:</l>
<l>Here let me first, in pious Gratitude,</l>
<l>Implore a Blessing on her Royal Head,</l>
<l>Who, tho' my Rival, was not less my Friend:</l>
<l>May Peace, and Joy, and Love, crown all her Hours!</l>
<l>And, when her Length of Life is fully spun,</l>
<l>Let not Death seem a King of Terrors to her;</l>
<l>But, like a smiling Angel, sent to guide</l>
<l>Her fleeting Soul to Realms of endless Bliss!</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Thy grateful Pray'r is just: And now, O think,</l>
<l>Think what a Lesson thou must teach thyself:</l>
<l>Canst thou forget the Luxury of Courts,</l>
<l>The soft'ning Joys of Vanity and Ease,</l>
<l>And Pleasure's sweet Inchantment of the Mind?</l>
<l>Say, canst thou quench the Fire of youthful Love,</l>
<l>And blot the Name of HENRY from thy Heart?</l>
<l>Canst thou devote thyself to pious Deeds,</l>
<l>To painful, rigid Holiness of Life;</l>
<l>To Meditation at the Midnight Hour;</l>
<l>To constant Watchings, and long Abstinence,</l>
<l>Religious Toil, that mortifies the Sense?</l>
<l>This is the Physic of a sickly Soul,</l>
<l>That labours to redeem its forfeit Peace.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>O Terms of Life severe, yet merciful!</l>
<l>The wholsome Discipline of Penitence</l>
<l>Shall reconcile me to offended Grace:</l>
<l>Wilt thou, thou good old Man, solicit for me?</l>
<l><pb n="62" facs="68"/>
Thy pious Intercession well shall speed</l>
<l>My tardy Vows, and waft them up to Heav'n.</l>
<l>Hence I give up the World without a Sigh;</l>
<l>The World! What's that? I give up HENRY too:</l>
<l>The Bubble breaks, the painted Scene is clos'd:</l>
<l>And now the calm, and sadly-pleasing View</l>
<l>Of peaceful Innocence, and purer Joys,</l>
<l>And Virtue, blasted like a beaten Flower,</l>
<l>Shocks my Remembrance, and upbraids my Soul.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Sense of past Vice is future Virtue's Basis,</l>
<l>And Self-conviction at the Bar of Conscience</l>
<l>More awes the waken'd Mind, than the Tribunal</l>
<l>Of solemn Justice, and the Pomp of Law:</l>
<l>Methinks, I hear the Host celestial shout,</l>
<l>And praise the noble Purpose thou hast made.</l>
<l>Heav'n is not deaf to Sorrow's piercing Voice:</l>
<l>Relenting it beholds the wounded Breast,</l>
<l>And kindly sheds the healing Balm of Mercy.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSAMOND.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Thy Words distil the honey'd Sweets of Peace:</l>
<l>A Beam of Comfort chears my sinking Soul,</l>
<l>And brighter Prospects open to my View:</l>
<l>Folly has sully'd my Renown of Youth,</l>
<l>But strict Severity of Thought and Action</l>
<l>Shall change the black Complexion of my Guilt</l>
<l>To Snow-white Purity. Ages to come</l>
<l>Shall hear my Tale with Pity, not Reproach;</l>
<l>And those who curse the shameful Name of <hi>Mistress,</hi></l>
<l>Shall bless the Convert, and admire the Saint.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>If the blest Lot of righteous Men above</l>
<l>Admits of Augmentation, it will glad</l>
<l>Thy Father's Spirit, to perceive this Change,</l>
<l>And give a better Relish to his Heav'n.</l>

As they would fly the Serpent's bitter Tooth:</l>
<l>Its sweetest Pleasures leave a Sting behind:</l>
<l>To virtuous Minds Religion's Path is smooth;</l>
<l>But she that falls like me, like me must tread</l>
<l>The thorny Road of sad Remorse and Sorrow.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Hail, gloomy Mansions! hail! Here will I dwell,</l>
<l>In lonely Cloisters, and a dreary Cell,</l>

<l>If this be true—and sure I feel it is,</l>
<l>I must not, dare not, think how I have wrong'd thee;</l>
<l>Earth does not bear so black a Wretch as me.</l>
<l>What hast thou done? Thou hast been wond'rous good;</l>
<l>Yet cruel to Excess—See her no more?</l>
<l>Shine then no longer, Sun—What! not to part?</l>
<l>Not one kind Word, one Kiss, one last Embrace!</l>
<l>O mournful, sad, eternal Banishment!</l>
<l>Banish'd? From whence? From a wild World of Folly,</l>
<l>To Virtue's calm Abode; banish'd to Heav'n.</l>
<l>And am I griev'd at this, because I lov'd her?</l>
<l>O sudden, painful Test of Sense and Honour!</l>
<l>Strong is the Voice of Reason, and of Virtue;</l>
<l>But Love pleads too, and Nature will be heard.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>I did not this with any mean Design:</l>
<l>Virtue seeks not Advantage from her Deeds:</l>
<l>Therefore I say not this deserves your Kindness:</l>
<l>The cool Respect of Gratitude I scorn;</l>
<l>My Love for thee was ever from the Heart,</l>
<l>And equal Love alone can make me happy:</l>
<l>Else, tho' undone, I have discharg'd my Duty.</l>

<l>I pr'ythee, pr'ythee, leave me, ELINOR—</l>

<l>The lovely Image clings about my Soul!</l>
<l>Hence, dear Illusion, pleasing Phantom, vanish!—</l>
<l>'Tis done—Methinks, yon golden Cloud descends;</l>
<l>And, lo! a heav'nly Form, that calls my Love!</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>P.</hi> HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Oh, Sir, 'tis past—Here, at your Royal Feet,</l>
<l>Behold this Rebel Son, a Penitent.</l>
<l>My haughty Soul, that erst climb'd Heaven high,</l>
<l>Is but a Reptile now—Ambition shrinks,</l>
<l>Ev'n like an empty Vapour vanishing,</l>
<l>Whose Place is seen no more—I only ask</l>
<l>Pardon, and Peace, for me, and these my Friends.</l>

<l>And if you lov'd,</l>
<l><pb n="69" facs="75"/>
May I presume to hope you will forgive too?</l>
<l>Sir, I once flourish'd in your Royal Smile:</l>
<l>Early my Soul began to pant for Glory:</l>
<l>But as the Seeds of Honour grew within me,</l>
<l>An artful Villain tamper'd with the Soil,</l>
<l>And spoil'd a goodly Crop—The rest you know—</l>
<l>Fortune, unequal to my daring Cause,</l>
<l>Has open'd since my Eyes: I wak'd indeed;</l>
<l>But only wak'd to see my Shame and Sorrow.</l>

<l>Can I have Faith in this? Thou hast deceiv'd me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>P.</hi> HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>'Twas in the fatal Day of youthful Folly:</l>
<l>But now the Purpose of Deceit is over;</l>
<l>For I am going henee, to that high Court,</l>
<l>Where Cunning cannot screen, or Darkness hide.</l>

<l>Alas! my Fears! What didst thou say, my Son?</l>

<sp>
<speaker><hi>P.</hi> HENRY.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Let me not waste my most important Moments.</l>
<l>I have this Morning drank a deadly Draught.</l>
<l>I feel all-conqu'ring Death advancing on me;</l>
<l>He lays close Siege: My sinking Spirits fail;</l>
<l>My Nerves are slacken'd all; my Blood runs cold,</l>
<l>And Nature's Out-works yield; tho' still my Heart,</l>
<l>Like a strong Citadel, resists the Storm.</l>

<l>Is there no Help? O fatal, woful Deed!</l>

<l>Why weeps my gentle Mother? What I did,</l>
<l>Was in the Frenzy of extreme Despair;</l>
<l>And Madness, if my Hopes have not been flatter'd,</l>
<l>Bars not the Gate of everlasting Mercy.</l>
<l>Reason has since resum'd her proper Seat,</l>
<l>And all is calm within—Yet would I take</l>
<l>A Father's Blessing with me to the Grave.</l>

<l>The QUEEN, my injur'd Mother, to your Love:</l>
<l>She never bore a Thought against your Highness.</l>

<lg>
<l>Honour, more than Grief,</l>
<l>Is due to Death like this, which has absolv'd,</l>
<l>By ending mortal Frailty: Mourns the QUEEN</l>
<l>So bitterly for him, whose hasty Spirit,</l>
<l>Aspers'd her spotless Name?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>That Name's now clear;</l>
<l>And he that did asperse it, was my Son.</l>
<l>He was my Son indeed—O there's the Sting!</l>
<l>And is it thus that we are reconcil'd?</l>
<l>Is Death alone the Peace-maker between us?</l>
<l>Why then I'll follow thee—Farewel, my Lord;</l>
<l>For, now, this Life has no Temptation left;</l>
<l>Yet, ev'n in Death, my Faith shall be approv'd,</l>
<l>And my last Breath shall be a Pray'r for thee.</l>
<l>It was the Study of my Life to please thee:</l>
<l>That fail'd, and I have now no farther Care.</l>
<l>That I ne'er meant thee Evil, ev'n in Thought,</l>
<l>By Proof too fatal Providence has shewn:</l>

<l>Welcome, Lord SALISBURY! Where's the good old CLIFFORD?</l>
<l>It is beneath a King to do Injustice;</l>
<l>But it is more beneath him to defend it.</l>
<l>Will he forgive my Baseness? For, methinks,</l>

<l>That's spoke indeed like great PLANTAGENET:</l>
<l>I read Content in ev'ry chearful Face,</l>
<l>And I am griev'd to spoil the gen'ral Joy:</l>
<l>My Liege, poor CLIFFORD lies a breathless Coarse,</l>
<l>By LEICESTER slain—But, dying, he forgave you—</l>
<l>It ever was his Wish to see this Day.</l>

<l>By holy Friendship thou hast touch'd my Soul.</l>
<l>It was but Yesterday I saw him well:</l>
<l>His keen Device did gall me to the Heart.</l>
<l>CLIFFORD, accept these Tears; for Tears are all</l>
<l>The Monarch, or the Friend, can give thee now.</l>
<l>We will do Honour to his Memory,</l>
<l>And show'r our Royal Bounty on his House:</l>
<l>O SAL'SBURY, let me take thee to my Heart,</l>
<l>Dear as thy Kinsman was.</l>
