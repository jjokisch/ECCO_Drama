<p>THE WAY TO GET MARRIED; <hi>A COMEDY,</hi> IN FIVE ACTS.</p>
<p>AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, COVENT-GARDEN.</p>
<p><hi>By THOMAS MORTON, Esquire.</hi></p>
<p><hi>AUTHOR OF COLUMBUS-ZORINSKI-CHILDREN IN THE WOOD, &amp;</hi></p>
<p>LONDON: PRINTED FOR T. N. LONGMAN, PATERNOSTER-ROW.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline><hi>Written by</hi> W. T. FITZGERALD, <hi>Esquire.</hi></byline>
<sp>
<stage><hi>Spoken by Mr.</hi> M'CREADY.</stage>
<l>THE stage should be, to life, a faithful glass,</l>
<l>Reflecting modes, and manners as they pass;</l>
<l>If these extravagant appear to you,</l>
<l>Blame not the drama,—the reflection's true—</l>
<l>Our Author makes of virtue no parade,</l>
<l>And only ridicules the <hi>vice</hi> of trade;</l>
<l>Exposes Folly in its native tint,</l>
<l>And leaves, mankind to profit by the hint.</l>
<l>The modern buck,—how diff'rent from the beau</l>
<l>In bag and ruffles, sixty years ago!</l>
<l>The city coxcomb then was seldom seen,</l>
<l>(Consin'd to Bunhill-row, or Bethnal-green:)</l>
<l>West of Cheapside you then could scarcely meet</l>
<l>The gay Lothario—of Threadneedle-street!</l>
<l>His folly rarely met the public eye,</l>
<l>Or, like a shadow, pass'd unheeded by:</l>
<l>Tradesman and rake were then remov'd as far</l>
<l>As gay St James's is from Temple-bar.</l>
<l>But now the cit must breathe a purer air,</l>
<l>The 'Change he <hi>visits</hi>—lives in Badford-square—</l>
<l>Insures a fleet—then Bootle's club attends,</l>
<l>Proud to be notic'd by his titled friends;</l>
<l>And tries to join, by Dissipation's aid,</l>
<l>The man of fashion with the man of trade.</l>
<l>Vain to associate with superior rank,</l>
<l>He quits his <hi>ledger</hi>—for the Faro bank;</l>
<l><pb facs="3"/>His dashing curricle down Bond-street drives,</l>
<l>Risking his <hi>own</hi>—and worse—his horses' lives;</l>
<l>Till, urging Fortune's glowing wheel too fast,</l>
<l>This empty air-blown bubble breaks at last!</l>
<l>Tho' trade may give such upstart mushrooms birth,</l>
<l>The Muse pays homage to its real worth.</l>
<l>This isle to commerce owes her splendid state,</l>
<l>The source of all that makes her truly great!</l>
<l>And 'midst her busy sons enough are found</l>
<l>To raise dejected mis'ry from the ground.</l>
<l>While commerce, with a lib'ral heart bestows</l>
<l>Her wealth, to mitigate the poor man's woes;</l>
<l>Seeks out the wretch, his gloomy prison cheers,</l>
<l>And wipes, with pitying hand, the widow's tears—</l>
<l>The applauding world will say (such bounty giv'n)</l>
<l>The English merchant is the steward of heav'n.</l>
<l>Our Author now that candour would implore,</l>
<l>Which your indulgence has bestow'd before;</l>
<l>Still on a gen'rous Public he depends;</l>
<l>Give your support—he asks no better friends!</l>

<head>SCENE I.</head>
<stage>A Room in a House—Bells ringing.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>DASHALL</speaker>
<stage>(without.)</stage>
<p>LANDLORD!</p>
</sp>
<stage>LANDLORD <hi>enters (smoaking.)</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Landlord.</speaker>
<p>Here I am—noisy chap this.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> DASHALL.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Where are all your people? Damn it, Landlord, is this your attention?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Land.</speaker>
<p>Who do you damn, eh? If you don't like my house, march,—there's another in the town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>This rascal now, because he has the best beds and wine on the road, claims the privilege of insulting his guests—call my servants up.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Land.</speaker>
<p>Not I—enough plague with my own—why don't you go to the other inn? I'll tell you—because you know when you are well off, ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Impudent scoundrel! but as I want information, I must humour him.—You're a high fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Land.</speaker>
<p>An't I?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>And so, old Boar's head, my good friend, To by Allspice, by the sudden death of his predecessor,
<pb n="2" facs="6"/>
enters this day upon the tonish office of sheriff of your ancient corporarion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Land.</speaker>
<p>He does.—And what's better, by the sudden death of an old maid, miss Sarah Sapless, he and his daughter will, it is said, enter upon the fingering of about thirty thousand pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Good news, egad!—Well, old Porcupine, get dinner; and, d'ye hear, none of your ropy champagne—the real stuff <stage>(slaps him on the back.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Land.</speaker>
<p>Well, I will—Ecod, I like you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Come, be off <stage>(strikes him with his whip.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Land.</speaker>
<p>Ecod, you have an agreeable way with you.</p>
<stage>Exit, shrugging his shoulders.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>In the ticklish state of my circumstances, Allspice and his daughter will be worth attending to.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SERVANT.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>Letters, sir, from London.</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Now for it! this makes me a bankrupt, or a good man. <stage>(Reads)</stage> Dear Dashall, all's up—As I thought.—Transfer swears if you don't settle your bear account in a week, he'll black-board you—Pleasant enough!—Affectionate inquiries are making after you at Lloyd's; and, to crown all, Hops were so lively last market, that there is already a lose of thousands upon that scheme—Nothing can save you but the ready.—Yours, TIM. TICK.</p>
<p>N. B. Green peas were yesterday sold at Leadenhall-Market at nine-pence a peck; so your bet of three thousand pounds on that event is lost. So! lurch'd every way—stocks, insurance, hops, hazard,
<pb n="3" facs="7"/>
and green peas, all over the left shoulder; and then, like a flat, I must get pigeon'd at faro by ladies of quality; for the swagger of saying The duchess and I were curst jolly last night; but, confusion to despair! I'm no flincher.—If I can but humbug old Allspice out of a few thousands, and marry his daughter, I shall cut a gay figure, and make a splash yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Waiter. </speaker>
<stage>(without)</stage>
<p>A room for Lady Sorrel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>What the devil brings her here?—Old and ugly as she is, I'll take decent odds but 'tis an intrigue.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> LADY SORREL.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>Inform my cousin Caustic, I'm here.— Ah! Dashall, I suppose the warm weather has driven you from town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>True; London was certainly too hot for me; but how could your ladyship leave the fascination of play?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>Hush! that's not my rural character.—I always assimilate.—The fact is, Dick, I have here a strange, plain-spoken, worthy, and wealthy relation; he gives me considerable sums to distribute in London to the needy, which I lose in play, to people of fashion; and you'll allow that is giving them to the needy, and fulfilling the worthy donor's intention, ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Then you are not here because your favourite, young Tangent, is arrived? eh!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>What, Dick, have you found out my attachment there? Well, I confess it: and if my regard be, not, I'll take care, my revenge shall be, gratified;
<pb n="4" facs="8"/>
and 'tis a great consolation that one is nearly as sweet as the other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>And I'll be equally can did. The miserable fact is, I am completely brozier'd, cut down to a sixpence, and have left town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>Like a skilful engineer, who, having laid his train for the destruction of others, prudently retires daring the blow-up.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust. </speaker>
<stage>(without)</stage>
<p>In the next room, do you say? <stage>(Enters)</stage> Lady Sorrel, I rejoice to see you, and have provided at home for your reception.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>Then I'll order my carriage and servants there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>No; I can depend on your prudence, but not on your servants'—S'death! were any of your fashionable London servants to get footing in my family, I suppose in a week my old housekeeper would give <hi>conversationes,</hi> a little music, and twopenny faro.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Vastly well.—By no means contemptible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>Cousin, this is Mr. Dashall, one of the first men in the city,—sees the first company, lives in the first style—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>This a merchant of the city of London?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Curse the quiz! Ill throw off a little—Perhaps you've not been in town lately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>No, sir,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Oh, the old school quite gone by—I remember, my old gig of a father wore a velvet nightcap in his cornering house—what a vile bore, ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>And pray, sir, what may you wear in your compting house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Strike me moral if I've seen it these three months. If you wish to trade in style, and make a splash, you must fancy Cheapside Newmarket, and Lloyd's and the Alley faro tables, for Demoivre has as completely ousted Cocker's Arithmetic with us, as Hoyle has the Complete Housewife with our wives, egad—talk of Brooks's or Newmarket; chicken hazard to the game we play at Lloyd's—monopoly's the word now, old boy; hops, corn, sugar, surs—at all in the ring.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Amazing! sir, your capital must be astonishing to be—at all in the ring</p>
<stage>(mimicking.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Capital! an old bugbear—never thought of now—no, paper—discount does it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Paper!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Aye; suppose I owe a tradesman, my taylor for instance, two thousand pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>A merchant owe his-taylor two thousand pounds! mercy on us!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>I give him my note for double the sum, he discounts it—I touch half in the ready—note comes due—double the sum again—touch half again, and so on to the tune of fifty thousand pounds. If monopolies answer, make all frraight—if not, smash—into the Gazette. Brother merchants say "damn'd fine fellow—lived in style:—only traded beyond his capital. So, certificate's signed—ruin a hundred or two reptiles of retailers, and so begin the war again.—That's the way to make a splash—devilish neat, isn't it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Pretty well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>How you stare! you <hi>don't</hi> know <hi>nothing</hi> of life, old boy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Vulgar scoundrel!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>We are the boys in, the city. Why, there's Sweetwort, the brewer,—don't you know Sweetwort? dines an hour later than any duke in the kingdom— imports his own turtle—dresses turbot by a stopwatch—has house-lamb fed on cream, and pigs on pine-apples—gave a jollification t'other day—Stokehole in the brewhouse—asked a dozen peers—all glad to come—can't live as we do. Who make the splash in Hyde-Park? who fill the pit at the opera who inhabit the squares in the west? why, the knowing ones from the east to be sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Not the wife one's from the east, I'm sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Who support the fashionable faro tables? oh, how the ducheffes chuckle and rub their hands, when they see one of us!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Duchesses keep gaming tables!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>To be sure! how the devil shou'd they live? such a blow-up the other night! you were there, Lady Sorrel!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>I at a saro table!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>No, no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash. </speaker>
<stage>(aside)</stage>
<p>Upon my honour I beg pardon—you see, sir, the duchess was dealing, and Mrs. Swagger was punting. Oh ho! cries Mrs. Swagger, "That was very neatly done"—"What do you mean?" says the duchess—"Only, madam, I saw you slip a card"—"dam'me" says the duchess—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Says the duke.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Says the duchess.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coust.</speaker>
<p>No, no! "dam'me," says the duke.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash</speaker>
<p>Psha! the duchess, I tell you. It's her way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Her way! O Lud!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Where was I? oh, "dam'me," says the duchess, "but you turn out of my house"—"and curle me," cries little miss Swagger, (a sweet amiable little creature of about fourteen) "if we stay here to be swindled."—Words got high, and oaths flew about like rouleaus; but as they had plucked me of my last feather, I got up, and, in imitation of my betters, twang'd off a few dam'mes, and retired.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>The world's at an end—all is sophisticated!—nothing bears even its right name—whoredom is gallantry; swindling, running out; female debauchery, a <hi>faux-pas.</hi> The murdering duellist has a nice sense of honour, the cuckold-maker is a dear delicious devil, and the cuckold the best humour'd creature in the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Well said, old one—you've some <hi>nous</hi> about you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Foul-tongued blockhead!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang. </speaker>
<stage>(without)</stage>
<p>Tell counsellor Endless I'll be in court presently.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>I think I know that voice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor. </speaker>
<stage>(tenderly)</stage>
<p>So do I. <stage>(aside)</stage>—'Tis your darling nephew, your adopted Tangent—I saw him come out of a chaise with two barristers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Psha! barristers! you forget he's in the army.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Lady Ser.</speaker>
<p>May'nt I trust my eyes?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Why, at fifty-nine, cousin, eyes are not always to be trusted. Pray, Mr. Dashall, do you know this nephew of mine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Oh yes; but he associates with authors and wits, quite out of our set—we in the city don't vote them gentlemen—you'll never find <hi>no</hi> wit at my table, I'll take care of that.—But you expect company, and so I'll be off to my friend Allspice's.—By the way, I hear his daughter will touch to the tune of thirty thousand pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust</speaker>
<p>Very likely: but I don't know any good it will do her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Not do good! I beg pardon. Riches gives wit,—elegance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Do they? I'm sorry you're so poor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Eh! what! oh neat enough! and what do you say riches give, queer one?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Generally, vulgar impertinence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>I congratulate you on being so rich, ha, ha! rat me! but at last I've said a good one. Lady Sorrel, your devoted.—Good bye, queer one!—What a superlative gig it is!</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust</speaker>
<p>Was that my nephew's voice?</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> TANGENT.</stage>
<p>Sir, your most obedient!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my dear uncle! who could have expected to have seen you in this part of the world?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>This part of the world! why, 'tis the town
<pb n="9" facs="13"/>
I live in, is it not? and have not you come on purpose to visit me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>True, uncle; I was—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>At your old tricks, castlebuilding. Fancying yourself Tippoo Saib, I warrant, or empress of all the Russias.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>No, no, you wrong me—Ah, lady Sorrel, how cou'd you leave town, where you were the ton?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>The ton, ha, ha! Then I suppose grandmothers are the ton?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>You have hit it, uncle, <stage>(aside to Caustic)</stage>—l never saw you look so well.</p>
<stage>(To lady Sorrel)</stage>

<p>He does, he does. Come, sir, no more of that. Age is respectable, and you ought to be above making a jest of an old woman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Caustic, your behaviour is intolerable. Mr. Tangent, do you dine with us?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Nothing can afford me greater felicity—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Than to dine with an old woman—Nonsense! Go home, cousin, go home.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>Brute! Mr. Tangent, good morning. Sweet, elegant youth! how my heart doats on him.</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Frank, leave that cursed trick, that—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>I know what you mean—I believe I used to indulge in little flights of fancy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>You did indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Ah, that's all over, My life passes in a dull consistent uniformity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>I'm glad on't—Well, how goes on the regiment?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>The regiment? Oh, I've left the army. <hi>Caust,</hi> Oh, you've left the army, <stage>(imitating)</stage>—and why, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>I don't know—I imagine I was tired of the routine, field-days, parade, mess-dinners, and so—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>And so what, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang</speaker>
<p>I determined to adhere to the law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>I've no patience with your solly. But, sir, are you sure the law has brought you here? Is it not some ridiculous love affair, some jilting tit from Exeter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang. </speaker>
<stage>(aside)</stage>
<p>I'll humour his dislike to the sex.— Women. Gewgaws for boys and dotards.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>True. He has a fine understanding.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>What are they all?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Ay; what are they all?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>The best of them are virtuously vicious, and impertinently condescending.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>He's a fine youth.—Go on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>All a contradiction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>True, Frank; Pope himself says so—</p>
<l>"Woman's at best a contradiction still;</l>
<p>then he goes on—</p>
<l>"A sop their passion, and their prize, a sot."</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>"Alive, ridiculous; and dead, forgot."— Sir, I've the whole epistle by heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Have you? Come to my arms. Now stick
<pb n="11" facs="15"/>
to this and the law, and my whole fortune is your own—when I die.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>And in the mean time I'll thank you for a thousand pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Thank me! I dare say you will. A thousand pounds! But how is it to be employed?—What fashionable scheme</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>A very unfashionable one; uncle; in paying my debts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>You know, Frank, you once disgraced yourself, and deeply offended me, by borrowing money of M'Query, a knavish money-lender. If your debts are of that description, you become my antipathy, my detestation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>On my honour, no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Well then, as I can better afford to lose it, than an honest creditor, I'll give it you on conditions—first, that you adhere to the law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Granted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Secondly, that you leave that hair-brain'd folly, which makes me mad,—that castle building.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Oh, granted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>And lastly, that this thousand shall be the sum total of your extravagance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart—And here's my hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>But, Frank, what say you to 30,000l. down on the nail?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>I say, sir, that no particular objection to it strikes me at present.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Then I'll tell you—Here's a will by which it is supposed miss Clementina Allspice will be heiress
<pb n="12" facs="16"/>
to that sum. Now I'll introduce you: and if, on seeing her, you agree with me that she is grossly vulgar, and extravagantly affected,—in short, should you thoroughly dislike her, I can see no rational objection to your marrying her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Certainly not—I'll attend you; but first I must go to the courts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Aye, stick to the law—stick to that—stick to any thing. You remember your pranks—This hour writing a satire on the frivolity of the age, the next, riding a hundred miles to shoot at a target —One day drest in solemn black for the purpose of ordination The next in a pink jacket and jockey cap, riding a match at Newmarket—So, no more of that, but stick to the law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>To be sure; what expansion of intellect it occasions! What honours does it not lead to!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>True.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Think of the woolsack.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>There's an object to look to!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Tremendous!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>My ambition anticipates my honours, and I see myself in the envied situation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Eh!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Dress'd in my robes, I bow to the throne.</p>
<stage>(Sits down with dignity in a chair.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! now he's at it.</p>
<stage>(Tangent rises and puts on his hat.)</stage>
<p>Order! Order! Is it your lordships pleasure this bill
<pb n="13" facs="17"/>
do pass—As many as are content, say, "Aye"—Not content, "No"'—The contents have it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Now would it not provoke the devil?— I humbly move that your lordship may leave the woolsack, and that your brains may cease to go a woolgathering.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>My lord!—Eh!—Oh!—I beg your excuse, uncle—I was just indulging a little flight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I know you were But where are you going?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>To the courts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Pray stick to the law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>And to the woolsack. Does not the hope of that fill our universities with blockheads—and cram our courts full of barristers, with heads as empty as they leave their clients' pockets?—As many as are content, say "Aye" Not content, "No"—The contents have it.</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>So mad and absurd as ever! But I trust he has a good heart, and I'll give him fair play; for, sometimes, the subsiding opposition of worth and folly produces the brightest characters, even as the beautiful firmament is said to have been formed from the contending chaos of light and darkness.</p>

<p>Heiress of penury. My darling girl! Oh, had heaven so will'd it, this had been a morning that pleasure might have long'd for. The sad reverse made sleep a stranger to me. I rose, and gave thee, Julia, all a poor fond father could,—a blessing at the throne of mercy.</p>

<p>If you've a bit of a bible, I'll take my oath—honour's all moonshine!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>No, sir. Honour, is the conversation of society: without it, even our virtues wou'd be dangerous. It tempers courage, and vice it puts to shame; it irradiates truth, and mixes up opposing passions in the sweet compound of urbanity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>Oh, very true; <stage>(aside)</stage> I'll pop that into my next brief. Oh, it will make a flashy speech for one of our fine pathetic barristers. But now for the secret. Whatever you communicate shall be locked here, upon my honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>It was my fate to marry contrary to my father's will, and I was driven by misfortune to India; where, after a residence of eighteen years, the news reached me of my father's decease, and that at his death he had done me the justice he refused me living. I was about to return to England to take possession of my estates, when the service demanded my assistance to check the inroads of a powerful banditti that infested the frontier.—In a skirmish, Lieutenant Richmond, a brave
<pb n="18" facs="22"/>
lad, fell by my side—he gave to my care one thousand pounds, as a bequest to his friend Mr. Tangent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>So far, so well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>On my return, sir, I found my wife dying. I am sorry to trouble you with hearing my misfortunes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>Don't mention it—'tis a pleasure—you found your wife dying.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>And my patrimony, as you know, usurped by a distant and wealthy relation—I endeavoured to find Mr. Tangent—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>Oh no!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>Indeed I did, sir—distresses came upon me—arrears for my daughter's education—the expences of my wife's funeral.</p>
<stage>(weeps)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query. </speaker>
<stage>(aside)</stage>
<p>Nobody wou'd grudge that, sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>And the hopes of recovering my right by law, induced me, sir, to, to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>Make use of Mr. Tangent's money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>Y—yes—sir. I doubted not but I cou'd soon replace it. I had considerable prize-money due— aye, and somewhat hardly earn'd—but it is not paid. Involved with agents, proctors—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>Aye, and sweet pretty picking it is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>Then, sir, I hoped soon to recover my estates. But the progress of the law, is, you know, so very slow—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>We don't—we don't hurry ourselves certainly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="19" facs="23"/>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>Now, sir, wou'd you advance the money to pay Mr.—</p>

<p>Why, you don't mean to pay it, do you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
<stage>(with indignation)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>Don't bother yourself about such a trifle— pay him! pugh! stuff! Between ourselves, I thought you had been dabbling in a little forgery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>Villain! <stage>(seizes him. M'Query smiles)</stage> Oh. I beg pardon—you are pleasant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I am very pleasant; and I wish I cou'd return the compliment. <stage>(aside)</stage> What a tiger! However, I'm glad you have the cash, because—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>Even now, I gave the last guinea I possess'd to my daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>That's unlucky! Because here's a little bit of a bill for labour, trouble, care and diligence, as we say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk. </speaker>
<stage>(taking it)</stage>
<p>This, then, is your proffer'd assistance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>Oh, read it, read it. You'll find it right to an eightpence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk. </speaker>
<stage>(reads)</stage>
<p>"Attending you frequently to offer my advice and friendship without being able to meet you, two pounds two."</p>
<stage>(with severity)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M'Query.</speaker>
<p>That's right and proper, and 'tis all like it; but as you've no cash, you may as well sign a little bit of a bond and judgment: it will make the debt an even fifty.</p>

<p>Now, sir, tho' you have put yourself in my power—</p>

<p>Hah! in your power—shallow fool! mark me. Dare but to hint at what I've told you, and by the honour I have lost, your life pays the forfeit—do you mark? In your power! Do you mark, I say?</p>

<p>Silence!

<p>Yes, I did. Sam Smuggle you must know was found guilty of taking a false oath at the Custom House; so the judge order'd me to put Sam in the pillory. "An please you, my lord judge," says I, "I'd rather not." "Why so, Mr. sheriff?" Because, my lord, says I, "Sam Smuggle, no more than a "month ago, paid me 37<hi>l.</hi> 18<hi>s.</hi> 11<hi>d.</hi> as per ledger, and I make it a rule never to disoblige a customer"—Then they a laughed—So you see I came off pretty well.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Desh.</speaker>
<p>Capitally. But an't you tired of this sneaking retailing</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, sometimes of a Saturday—<hi>Market day.</hi></p>

<p>'Tis a vile paltry bore. What do you make by this raffish shop of yours?</p>

<p>Oh, a great deal. Last year 1745l. odd money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Monopoly?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>To be sure—the way we knowing ones thrive. You remember that on sugar—a first rate thing, was it not?—distressed the whole town—made them take the worst commodity at the best price: netted fifteen thousand pounds by that.</p>

<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Shall I tho'? but did you sell all that sugar yourself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>I fell! never saw a loaf. No, my way is this—I generally take my first clerk a hunting with me; and when the hounds are at fault, we arrange these little matters.</p>

<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Oh, is it there I have you? then come to town, my gay fellow, enjoy affluence and pleasure, and make a splash.</p>

<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Aye, you shall have my Harriet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Almonds and raisins! pearls and diamonds!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Yes; but how am I to get them?</p>

<sp>

<p>You've heard of the Alley?</p>

<p>Yes; but I don't understand it. Bulls and bears—</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Aye; and what's being a lame duck?</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Aye, but you forget that other knowing ones have formed a capital plan for preventing the starving of the nation.</p>

<p>With all my heart. Sir, your lovely daughter came to Allspice's shop, when—I don't recollect how—but somehow or other, I had got this apron round me—she took me for the shopman; and for the pleasure of beholding her, I became a porter, and to continue that happiness, wou'd become <stage>(seeing M' Query)</stage>—an attorney. This is the fact: I can't tell a lie for the soul of me.</p>
</sp>

I'll ship off a yard of ribbon with e'er a six-foot haberdasher in town, return the drawer to it's place with a smack—roll up change in a bit of paper—smirk—present it with the counter-bow—an't I perfect, ma'am?</p>

<p>Well, I lied it stoutly—the veriest rascal, that eats the bread of perjury, could not have lied it with more unblushing boldness.

we part not. What remains?—To go to Tangent—crawl in the dust, and be spurn'd by him!—rot and damn first!—despair then is only left: for the world's palliations, as degrees of guilt—the law of necessity will not give comfort here. No, to the truly proud, the first step from honour is perdition.</p>

<p>Oh no. It is he that has the disposal of my aunt's fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Oh, that's the reason that all the women were paying court to him. I swear, he look'd like the grand signior with a seraglio at his heels.</p>

<p>Ma'am, your most obedient—miss, your devoted. Good-day, madam—oh, miss, happy to see you. <stage>(coming forward)</stage> Oh my back! my back! I must go home, ha, ha! But I can't help laughing at
<pb n="48" facs="52"/>
the absurd adulation paid me. I who was yesterday a sour curmudgeon, am to-day the monopolizer of all human excellence. Oh my poor back! Oh world! world!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust. </speaker>
<stage>(bows)</stage>
<p>Your most obedient.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>I hope, sir, you approve of our music and gala.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>To say the truth, madam, I preferr'd my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>Your own, I vow! Pray, when did you give a gala, Mr. Caustic?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>In the last frost, madam, to two hundred paupers and their helpless families—and we had our dancing too, ma'am: for the little chubby brats in merry anticks gambol'd round my knees: and we had music too, madam; for the widows sung for joy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>Oh charming!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Damn'd fine indeed! I think with you certainly, sir, that—what the devil is the word? Benevolence, is it not?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>Yes, there is such a word—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Aye—benevolence, virtue, and all that, are at times extremely amusing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Amusing! sir, virtue is the business of our lives; all else is its idleness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>I vow, sir, I was shocked to see you so teized by the fulsome attentions of the women. Flattery is not way to secure the approbation of a man—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Of your fine feelings and understanding.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="49" facs="53"/>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>It is not indeed! <stage>(aside)</stage> Madam, Mr. Allspice wants you.</p>
</sp>

<p>Favour me with your hand.</p>

<p>Sir, your devoted. Ah, what worlds of feeling!</p>

<stage>Exeunt smiling and nodding approbation to each other.</stage>

<p>Aye, that you wou'd!</p>

<p>And a libertine?</p>

<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>So you say, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>And what do you say for yourself?—A profess'd libertine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I say that I practise what I profess; which is more than you moralists can say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Psha! and the world says you're a coxcomb.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Damn the world then for making me one. How the devil can I help being a coxcomb, when I see a flattering fool like myself idolized, and modest worth despised? Uncle, the temple of Folly wou'd soon be without votaries, had it not the world for its worshippers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>But zounds! did the world clap you on the woolsack? did the world put you on an apron, or desire you to make another siege of Troy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Upon my soul, I'm asham'd of myself; but by future perseverance and diligence, I'll atone for my follies. Come, uncle, forgive the past—shake hands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>No—well—there—aye, Frank, persevere, and you may soon convert your air-built castle into a solid one of brick and mortar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>True; then every one will say, his character does not rest on the flimsy basis of hereditary worth, but on the noble exertion of talent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>That's well said.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Then I with conscious dignity will walk thro' my hall—my servants ranged on each side—I bend to them with ease, call my agent, and say to him, distribute an hundred pounds to—</p>

<p>Death and fury, you're at it again!</p>

<p>No, no—that was only—</p>

<p>What will drive me mad. 'Sdeath! what is talent without the will and means to exert it? 'Tis Newton without his telescope, or Handel without his organ.—Remember, this is your last, last warning!</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>He's certainly right. That Handel was a great man; and tho' bereft of one sense, how amply was another gratified! For what can strike more gratefully on the heart, than hearing the honourable applause of an impartial public?</p>

<p>Your dinner was stylish, faith.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Very; but it had one little fault. There was nothing to eat—grottoes, trees, fountains, sweetmeat shepherdesses, and buttered Cupids in plenty,—nothing else. I shou'd have been half starved, had I not luckily looked over my shoulder, and there beheld my old friend, the honoured sirloin, on the sideboard—I could have cried to see him so disgraced; but I order'd him to be conducted to the top of the table, and the music to strike up "Oh the Roast Beef of Old England!" and, then, how I ogled the girls, and how they titter'd at me! women give a man's ideas so elegant a turn. I'm as much above what I was, as a hogshead is to a butter firkin.</p>

<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Yes; he has a scheme of buying up furs, by which 100 per cent. must be made in a month.—A trifle—five thousand—will do; but at present my cash is here and there. Indeed at this moment I can't exactly tell you where it is, But if you should like it—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>You would not have me lay out five thousand pounds in muffs and tippets, wou'd you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Five thousand! I've speculated deeper in darning needles.—But you have not the cash?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Yes but I have tho'—that sum in the house. too—I intended to buy with it half an estate valued at ten thousand pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Then defer the purchase one month, and I'll engage you shall buy the whole.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Oh charming! ah, but should it fail—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>But it can't fail—if it do, then blame me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>That's enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>All you will have to do, will be to come to town in a month, and hug your ten thousand pounds, as sure as the sweet Harriet will hug you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Oh the pretty one! That has fixed me. When the company is gone, I'll give you bank notes to the amount:—and tell your hunting clerk, if he'll make the five thousand ten, I'll give him a guinea. Oh, what a rich, jolly dog I shall be! let's go and have another touch at the little bottle,—another guinea's worth—damn the expence! and drink confusion to

I've bother'd the daughter, and tickled old Caustic in a capital style,—that's a dead thirty thousand.—Humbugged the old one here out of five, and shall carry off the nice girl to a certainty. What a splash I shall make along Cheapside! what a swagger I shall cut at Lloyd's! how the city bucks will stare, and, may be, dress at me.

<p>You see by that letter how things are, and what care I've taken of the Captain's property.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>I'll put this in my pocket, and read it at leisure.</p>

<p>No, no—I'm always for vouchers—that letter shou'd not be lost.</p>

<p>There I agree with you. Eh, I have it— <stage>(Tears off the half sheet with the contents of the letter, from the half sheet that, contains the address, wraps that up, and gives it to M'Query.)</stage> So—there's the letter.</p>

<p>Oh! I've a clerk will set his hand to it at any time—That Faulkner's a pretty fellow, is'nt he? To be sure, the coolness with which some people take others' property is amazing <stage>(taking up the bond)</stage>—In two hours' time you shall have the two hundred pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Very well; I must go, and tickle my old uncle, and then away to relieve poor Faulkner.</p>

<p>Oh yes; and, like a razor, I've found strapping a mighty good thing for them.</p>

<p>No—he only borrows five hundreds.</p>

<p>And, perhaps, is called so. Ah, girl, the tickery of this knavish world makes a wide difference between honour to woman and to man. The wretch that robs the father of his child, let him but at a gaming table keep his word with man, and he's of honour
<pb n="67" facs="71"/>
Nay, shou'd this wretch, in aggravation, meet that wrong'd father in the field, and lay him at his feet a corpse, then, who dare deny that he's a man of honour?</p>

<p>But he's a merchant, sir—a rank of men whose nobleness and benevolence are far above my praise.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Jailer.</speaker>
<p>Oh, how they become him! I'm sure your leg was made for them. I'll be hanged if I flatter you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang. </speaker>
<stage>(sighs)</stage>
<p>Indeed you do not. Certainly, a very neat appendage to a gentleman—heigho!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jailer.</speaker>
<p>I declare it gives me pleasure to see you in them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>You have all the pleasure to yourself. Heigho! I feel devilish queer. Retire!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Your club! <stage>(reads)</stage> The gentlemen prisoners inform Mr. Tangent they have elected him a member of the select club, and solicit the honour of his company to a turbot, haunch, claret, and chicken hazard.—The club, to prevent accidents, meet on Sunday, Monday being hanging-day. Hanging-day!—'tis alarming, very,—what do you want?—</p>

<speaker>Solicitor.</speaker>
<p>I'm a Newgate solicitor; and for 50<hi>1.</hi> will undertake to prevent gibbeting at least.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Gibbeting! Begone, you croaking— <stage>(drives, him off)</stage> And what will you undertake?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Undertaker.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I'm an undertaker; and if you, are not engaged, wou'd be proud to inter—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Go to the devil! <stage>(drives him off)</stage> Leave the room, you infernal—Gibbet! Undertaker!—Heigho! —Pugh! I can't have kill'd the fellow—his scull must have been thinner than mine, to crack with such a paltry blow.—How has my letter sped with Faulkner —That's nearest my heart—Oh, Julia!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jailer. </speaker>
<stage>(without)</stage>
<p>You'll find Mr. Tangent in the next room, ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Heavens! 'tis Julia! 'tis herself! and joy brightens her lovely countenance. Oh, let me meet her! Damn these things! 'Sdeath! how shall I conceal my disgrace? What can I do to—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> JULIA.</stage>
<stage>(Tangent holds his handkerchief before his fetters).</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>Sir, with a heart oppress'd with gratitude, let me kneel—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Loveliest creature, rise! Allow me to— <stage>(is about to raise her when he recollects his fetters)</stage> Pray rise, ma'am; you distress me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>Why should benevolence shrink from praise?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Angelic excellence! call it love, adoration— I'm your slave—upon my soul, I'm in chains—I beg pardon—but my love is pure as your own thoughts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="73" facs="77"/>
<speaker>Julia</speaker>
<p>Sir, I believe you noble—above base concealment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>By heaven I would not conceal any thing; that is, not any thing that—that—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>Sir, my father is anxious to see you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Happy tidings!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>Will you favour him with your company?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Instantly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>This way then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Yes, ma'am. <stage>(recollecting himself)</stage> That is, presently—I'll come presently to—to—to his house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>Farewel! Oh, sir, my feelings wou'd be unworthy, cou'd I express them—But these tears of joy—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Dry them, lovely creature. By heaven, they affect me to that—</p>
<stage>(raises his handkerchief to his eyes, recollects himself, then pulls a chair towards him, and gets behind it, leans over it, and wipes his eyes.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>What noise was that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>I did not hear any noise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>The clank of fetters. I dread to meet those miserable beings—Perhaps some horrid murderer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Very likely, ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>Yet I must pity them.</p>

<p>These decorations are not exactly the thing, to be sure, ha, ha!</p>

<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>How lucky that I came! His despair might have made him kill himself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>I could sing—dance for joy. Dance! I remember seeing a man at the playhouse dance a hornpipe in a pair of these things, and did it devilish well too—Let me see—somehow!—Tol de rol lol lol! <stage>(sings and dances, not seeing Caustic)</stage> My uncle! Confusion!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caustic.</speaker>
<p>I shall go mad! <stage><hi>(after a struggle for breath)</hi></stage> Oh you—I can't speak—dancing! But you'll have but one dance more, and that will be upon nothing, —you—the wounded man is dead.</p>
</sp>

<p>Dead! Heaven forbid!</p>

<p>Now this is not fair play! What a rascally shame! What the devil does Fortune mean by it? Zounds! to be bankrupt! My name in the Gazette at this moment, when I was doing them all in such a capital style! And, then, to lose the nice girl! I suppose I shall have that fellow, Tangent, demanding satisfaction. Oh, my smashing will fly about like wildfire. If I can't in one hour humbug old Allspice, and marry his daughter, I must scud. Fortune, be but kind! Damn her! she's a jade, I'll not invoke her. But thou, genius of swindling! Oh stick by me now, and I'll never forsake thee. She's propitious! for here comes one flat.</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ALLSPICE.</stage>
<p>Well, Toby, what are you thinking about?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>London. I never was there. You must show me the sights—The lions at the Tower, and the bulls and bears at the Stock Exchange; the parliament-house, and the wax-work;—the bench of bishops, and
<pb n="77" facs="81"/>
the maids of honour. And, my dear friend, you'll show me the King's Bench?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Aye, that I will.</p>

<p>Oh, thank you, thank you—'Tis an enormous sum—I don't know what to think.</p>

<p>What to think! Think of the profits. Nay, why so dull? Where's your spirits, your life?</p>

<p>That infernal hornpipe has completely ruin'd me with my uncle. But, be that as it may, if she will consent, Julia Faulkner shall be mine, tho' this spade were my only portion. And why not this spade? What can more nobly employ the exertion of man than improving the blessings providence has sent him? I can fancy myself seated at my cottage-fire, with my Julia and thirteen children,—the equal serenity of the scene harmonizing with the tranquil uniformity of my disposition. Happy employment! There we see the art of man even giving climate. <stage>(pointing to the hot-house)</stage> Eh! I thought I caught a glimpse of that hypocrite, lady Sorrel, endeavouring to conceal herself. I suppose a hot-house suits the warmth of her disposition; if so, she shall have it hot enough.— <stage>(aloud)</stage> Confound the carelessness of these rascally gardeners, leaving doors and windows open!—cold as an ice-house. <stage>(locks door)</stage> The grapes will be sour; and I know there's a fine old sensitive plant within, that can't bear being exposed—I'll bring things forward, <stage>(during this he puts up the glass, opens the flues, and blows the fire)</stage> Zounds!

<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>True; there's no making a splash here. I must reside in a place suited to my elegant ideas. London's the shop for me.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="84" facs="88"/>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>His name in the Gazette.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Where? where? Oh, will any body lend me a pair of spectacles?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>Are you short-sighted?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Oh very—I've a notion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>Ah! <stage>(pointing to his name in the Gazette)</stage> There he is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Where is he? <stage>(jumping round and seizing Caustic)</stage> He's a villain!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>I thought he was your friend,—the man that cropt you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Yes, he has cropp'd me with the devil to it; cropped me of five thousand pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Five thousand pounds! What was he to do with it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>To buy tippets.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Tippets!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Ay, and bosom-friends. What had I to do with bosom-friends? Damn all friends! I was once happy and friendless. Eh! I left him here. I hope he is not gone to make a splash with my dear money—I hope he's in the garden. Mr. Dashall! Mr. Dashall! I want to speak to you, Mr. Dashall. Come here, will you, my dear friend? I only want to speak to you. Oh, if I cou'd but fasten on him—I want to give you another thousand pounds. I do indeed. Oh, the infernal villain! My excellent friend, don't hide yourself.</p>
<stage>(goes up the stage, looking about)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Everlasting, everlasting disappointment! will nobody have thirty thousand pounds?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="85" facs="89"/>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Caustic, pray sir, don't be in such a hurry. If you will but have the kindness to wait till to-morrow, I dare say I can get somebody to marry me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>I would not stay an hour. Will nobody have thirty thousand pounds?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>I will, give it to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>But on the terms—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Any terms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Will you marry?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Any body.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>You marry, pa! too ridiculous, a vast deal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Hold your tongue, hussey—I feel I shall be miserable without money, so I may as well marry and be miserable with it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>Dear Mr. Caustic, only wait till to-morrow. I'll ask every body to have me. Oh do! lud, I shall be under such a style of obligation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>I'll make it a principle to please. Oh do!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>I won't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clem.</speaker>
<p>Won't you? then you are an old wretch, a brute; and I hope, pa, if you marry, you'll be a brute: and <stage>(to Caustic)</stage> I vow I wish your gout may return, and shoot up into your wither'd head in such a style— Yes, you may laugh— <stage>(sobbing)</stage> but to be utterly ruined is extremely disagreeable.</p>
<stage>Exit, weeping.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Oh, he's gone!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Friend Toby, a lucky thought—I've hit
<pb n="86" facs="90"/>
upon a wife for you. What say you to your visitor, my cousin, Lady Sorrel? she's virtuous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>I've my doubts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Oh fie! no, she's extremely correct,—correct even to appearances. Her good conduct defies suspicion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Then 'tis a bargain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart; and by giving you my hand, I give</p>
<stage>(going to shake hands, a crash is heard in the hot-house.)</stage>
<p>What's that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>More of my property going. I suppose some old blind tabby cat has got into my hot-house. Bring the blunderbuss, will you?</p>
<stage>(to officer)—(Lady Sorrel screams, and Allspice unlocks the door, and Lady Sorrel comes out.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Lady Sorrel!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Hey day, cousin!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>I'm quite faint.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Rest on me, my lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>The heat of the place.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>You seem rather warm. Pray, have you seen any thing of my dear friend, Mr. Dashall?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>I, sir? no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>This has an odd appearance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>I'll explain it. Cousin, I went in to pull a bunch of grapes; and a booby of a servant passing by, lock'd the door.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>I'm satisfied. Well, cousin, I've got you a
<pb n="87" facs="91"/>
husband here. Nay, no blushing. You are too wise and too old for girlish affectation. With my friend Toby, I give you thirty thousand pounds, and as times go, a pretty honest man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my lady, an honest pretty man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>And, friend Toby, with my cousin you have neither youth nor beauty, to be sure; but abundance of chastity, virtue, and benevolence, so heaven—</p>
<stage>(another crash is heard.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! what's that? I dare say, one of Cleme's puppy dogs.— <stage>(to officer)</stage> Go in, and pull him out by the cuff of the neck</p>
<stage>(officer goes in.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>I declare I'm quite faint again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Let me support you—I'll never leave you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Officer </speaker>
<stage>(comes out with Dashall)</stage>
<p>Have I found yon at last?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Dashall!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Who?</p>
<stage>(Lets go Lady Sorrel, and runs to Dashall, puts his hand into his pocket, and recovers his notes.)</stage>
<p>Give me my money, you villain! here it is. Oh, let me kiss you, and lay you to my faithful breast.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>How have I been deceived!</p>
<stage>(to Lady Sorrel)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Caustic, you'll excuse my marrying.— <stage>(to Dashall)</stage> I can see your roguery without spectacles, you monopolizer of viliany! farewell to dashing! Roger, bring me my wig and apron.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang. </speaker>
<stage>(without)</stage>
<p>Sir, I entreat—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>My nephew! dare he come in my presence? then you shall see me knock him down.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Allsp.</speaker>
<p>No, no</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>In vain you fly me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>You distress me—I beg, sir,—I insist—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>Never can my soul be satisfied, till my knees bend in gratitude—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Captain Faulkner! upon my soul, 'tis devilish hard to have one's feelings distressed, because a man has done a trifling act—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>What's this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>A trifling act! have you not redeemed me from prison, from despair? have you not preserved my Julia's honour?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Stand by. I don't think I shall knock him down.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>If I have been so fortunate, let my reward be the preservation of that honour with my life, and for my life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I shou'd certainly feel proud of your alliance;—but you have a relation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>What, old uncle, ha, ha! I have certainly plagued him most confoundedly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>I believe I'll knock him down</p>
<stage>(raises his cane)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>But, upon my honour, to make him unhappy, wou'd give me serious sorrow. <stage>(Caustic drops his cane)</stage> Oh, sir, give me but Julia Faulkner without fortune—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>I forbid the banns.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I insist.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>And, sir, I insist that you don't marry miss
<pb n="89" facs="93"/>
Faulkner without a fortune, but that you marry her with thirty thousand pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Most excellent uncle! my sweetest Julia! and will you, sir, forgive my follies?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>Heartily, my boy. Frank, I can pardon the head for wandering, when I find the heart's at home.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Tangent, I give you joy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Gently! while you were affluent, the elegant flavour of your Tokay kept down the coarse twang of the borachio in your manners. But now you're poor, you'll be cut even by your brother swindlers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faulk.</speaker>
<p>Is not this the wretch—?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I shou'd be happy to give you satisfaction; but you see I'm in custody— <stage>(Faulkner going up to him)</stage> Officer, do your duty: why don't you secure me? I never despair—do you think this is the first time I've been in the Gazette? I've some irons in the fire yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>And if you want more irons, I cou'd recommend you to a pair that wou'd suit you exactly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Dashall, are you going to town?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Officer.</speaker>
<p>You may depend upon it, my lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Sor.</speaker>
<p>If you'll give me leave, I'll accompany you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>First let me thank you, madam, for the delicate anxiety you have shewn respecting me and this gentleman, and for your humanity in arresting my father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caustic.</speaker>
<p>Did she do that? abandoned hypocrite! leave my sight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dash.</speaker>
<p>Well, I bear no malice. Good bye to you all.
<pb n="90" facs="94"/>
I say, Toby, won't you send some almonds and raisins to Harriet?—ha, ha! Now to London, and my creditors, where I'll nobly give them fivepence halfpenny in the pound, and the jolliest dinner the London Tavern can produce—Good bye to you, gigs! dam'me, I'll make a splash yet.</p>
<stage>Exeunt Dashall, Lady Sorrel, and Officer.</stage>

<p>Put him in my horse-pond. Let him make a splash there.</p>

<p>Hold—oh dread not my personal chastisement: your abject villainy protects you from that—</p>

<p>It is not the first time it has stood my friend.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>"Faulk.</speaker>
<p>Do you see this letter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>"M'Query.</speaker>
<p>I certainly missed it, and am ready to refund.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>"Faulk.</speaker>
<p>You disgrace an honourable profession, and are the vile exception to the liberal and noble character of your nation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Sir! I am worth twenty thousand pounds, and am your humble servant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>"Tang.</speaker>
<p>Villain!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>"M'Query.</speaker>
<p>Take care what you say, young gentleman—don't you libel an attorney—'tis the most heinous crime—the devil a lawyer will plead your cause for you; but the whole battalion of the black badgers will open upon you, and tell you that libelling an attorney strikes at the root of humanity; it
<pb n="91" facs="95"/>
tears out the vitals existence; it shivers the adamantine bands of society; it makes curds and whey of the milk of human kindness; it convulses and confuses, and disturbs and distorts—Oh! whatever you do, never libel an attorney.</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>I hope, sir, my Julia has made you a convert.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caust.</speaker>
<p>She has indeed—and I beg pardon of her sex, to whom she this given this lesson—that the affection and duty of a daughter is the best security for happiness in a wife; and that filial affection and feminine diffidence is THE WAY TO GET MARRIED. As for you, nephew—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tang.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I've bade adieu to all my air-drawn fancies, except the woolsack, in which whim I will once more indulge, in the trembling hope, that our endeavours this night to please, have been crowned with your candid approbation. As many as are content say "Aye." — non-contents, "No." We flatter ourselves the contents have it.</p>

<sp>
<l>THE dubious title of our Play this night</l>
<l>Might fill mama with joy, or miss with fright.</l>
<l>"The Way to get a Husband," and what not;—</l>
<l>But are they worth the getting when they're got?</l>
<l>"Yes," cries bold miss,—whom mother's kind regard</l>
<l>Has led, at young fourteen, to cock her card,</l>
<l>"Yes," cries bold miss, "whate'er the formals say,</l>
<l>They are worth getting, and I know the way.</l>
<l>—The way's up Bond-street! where we daily range,</l>
<l>Where sauntering bloods crowd Fashion's full exchange!</l>
<l>There (charming scene!) as undismay'd we strut—</l>
<l>Dogs, misses, dukes, and draymen, meet full butt!</l>
<l>There, lounging arm in arm, half-booted crops,</l>
<l>With heads so dark, you'd swear they were—black mops!</l>
<l>There, muslin petticoats with mud so lac'd▪</l>
<l>Here scarlet spencers with an inch of waist,</l>
<l>So scarlet all, my rouge they seem to scoff,</l>
<l>And look like lobsters with their tails cut off!</l>
<l>Here for a husband is the scene to dash,</l>
<l>Here for a town-bred miss to—make a splash.</l>
<l>The plump, brisk widow takes a different road,</l>
<l>She cannot walk down Bond-street:—she's a load!</l>
<l>Good sixteen stone to carry—but yet strong:</l>
<l>She rolls a wool-pack Venus,—broad as long!</l>
<l>Yet she's a tender passion for the stage!</l>
<l>With her, dear <hi>private acting</hi> is the rage.</l>
