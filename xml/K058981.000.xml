<p>THE moment that a Reader takes up a Book with a Design to peruse it, he naturally wishes for all the Information possible, relative to the Writer and Writing of it—</p>
<p>WILLING, in every <hi>reasonable</hi> Degree, to satisfy the Curiosity of my good Friends and Purchasers, I shall candidly answer their following Questions:</p>
<p>Pray, who is the Author of this Comedy?</p>
<p><hi>A man in Obscurity, unnoticed, and content to remain so.</hi></p>
<p>Has it ever been performed in London?</p>
<p><hi>No.</hi></p>
<p>Was it ever offered to the Managers of either Theatre there?</p>
<p><hi>No.</hi></p>
<p>For what reason?</p>
<p><hi>Because the Author was truly sensible that it had not Merit sufficient to recommend it to their Notice.</hi></p>
<p>What are his Motives for publishing it now?</p>
<p><hi>Necessity, not Inclination.</hi></p>
<p>Is it worth purchasing?</p>
<p><hi>An odd Question—He is afraid not—But, good bye, Read on and judge for yourself.</hi></p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SEDLEY <hi>and</hi> WOODFORD,</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>SO, Sedley, you really have been three weeks without seeing Miss Bloomer?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>True, I assure you, Woodford, and intend, if my resolution holds, never to see her again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>But I understood every thing was settled between you both, and that nothing remain'd but to name the happy day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Prithee, Woodford, no more.—It adds to my uneasiness to hear her mention'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Why so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Because I find, this too susceptible heart of mine cannot so readily erase the impressions her youth, beauty, and innocence have made upon it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! But what reason can you have for wishing it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>The greatest in the world, Woodford.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>I cannot think so,—explain, or I shall certainly imagine you whimsical and capricious.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>When I first paid my addresses to Miss Bloomer, such were the beauties of her mind as well
<pb n="2" facs="11"/>as person, that I fancied I had found one, all perfect as the first, before she fell.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Then were you in an Adamitical paradise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>A fool's one, rather,—she received me with such a flattering distinction that I thought myself the happiest of mortals, when unluckily, her guardian's dying put her into the immediate possession of a large fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Now I should have thought that the luckiest circumstance that cou'd have happen'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Quite the contrary,—thus freed from restraint, at the age of eighteen, she emerged into all the fashionable follies of the great world, without a real friend to advise, or direct her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Why did not you undertake that office?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>I did, but soon found it was an ungrateful one—so fine a girl, independent of interested motives, cou'd not fail of attracting a crowd of admirers; and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>You, naturally grew jealous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Jealous! My heart was torn in pieces.—'Twas then I discover'd a levity of temper, a thoughtlessness, a love of pleasure, that destroy'd my hopes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Psha! trifles.—Foibles like these are as specks upon the sun.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but in time they threaten a total eclipse.—No character, however contemptible, but was encouraged as a lover.—No scene of gaiety, however censurable, but was pursued with avidity.—A thousand instances did I patiently bear with, in hopes of amendment.—Oft in the gentlest terms, did I convey advice, and represent the hazards she ran; as oft was I forbad her presence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! upon my word, you took an excellent method of rendering yourself agreeable to a girl of her age and spirit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>But when I intended that girl as a partner for life, cou'd you blame my cautious conduct? No,
<pb n="3" facs="12"/>Woodford; though never man was more sensible of beauty's charms than I, yet unless those charms are adorned with virtue, they make not half the impression.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>That's a little romantic; but pray go on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Many times did I rescue her from the most imminent dangers which her indiscretions plunged her into, yet still she persevered.—At length,—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Hold, who comes here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Oh, 'tis Monsieur Finesse,—one of my rivals,—a fellow, whose impudence can only be equall'd by his ignorance.</p>
</sp>

<sp>

<p>Any thing particular, Finesse?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>Oh, oui, ver particular—for your own ear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>You may speak out before Woodford, I have just been acquainting him with the whole affair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>Qu' avez vous fair?—Ma foy, dat be wrong done.—You shou'd say noting to hurt de fine Lady's reputation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>He is my particular friend, and I can answer for his discretion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>Parbleu! particular friend sometime do de mosht mischief.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>That will not be the case with me, I promise you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Come, what news of Miss Bloomer?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>Ah, pauvre Lady! she had de grand escape yesterday.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Escape? how?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>Why, she be taking de innocent diversion at Vauxhall, wid de bon companie, as she suppose, and engage in de partie wid tree gentlemen, and deux ladie, to be entertain in a boat on de Thames.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>In a boat on the Thames?—Well!—Go on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>Dey be all stranger to her, but vat of dat? She not tink any harm.—So dey row, row along, have de musique, sing de petite chanson, and be all so merry and gay, till dey land at de Cousin, as dey call her, but begar she be—Vat you call Fille de joie?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Woman of the town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>Oui,—she be woman of de town,—den Miss Bloomer find her mistake, and vant to return home again.—Dey say, no, no, and grow hardis,—at last, when she be almost excedée, etrois gentlemen by accident hear her cries, and tout à fait, rescue her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Wou'd I had been there!—Villains!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>Oh, oui!—Villains indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>You see, Woodford, there's another instance of her conduct.—Do you think it possible for me to be happy with such a woman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>I tell you, man, you are too delicate.—Tho' appearances are against her, yet, I dare affirm, that these are all mistakes of the heart, which in time her better judgment will rectify.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>True, dey be all in de heart,—all vivacité, noting else.—I must find some oder opportunity, when I shall have him to himself. <stage>(aside)</stage> Well, Monsieur Sedley, I vill bid you de good morn,—I am going to visit de Lady, I shall hear someting more dere, and den I vill call on you at home, in private.—Gentlemen, sans compliment, I have de honneur to be your very humble servant.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Hearky', Sedley, do you build anything upon this fellow's intelligence?—A wretch! that's an outcast, and disgrace to his nation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Yet this very outcast, as he really is, does she treat in the most encouraging manner; and, without the least enquiry into his fortune or character, admit amongst the number of her admirers.—But let us change the subject.—So then it seems your Uncle has civilly dismiss'd you his house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Not so civilly, I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Don't you think you deserved it? Captain Helm, you know, has spent the greater part of his life in ploughing the tempestuous ocean, and tho' possest of an excellent heart, has not the least idea of the refined sentiments inspired by a liberal education.—You were certain that your whole dependance was upon him, yet refus'd flattering the harmless foibles which peculiarly mark his character.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>You mistake me, Sedley, I often did, till this last affair.—But, when he commenc'd my rival, my happiness was too much concern'd to trifle any longer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Well, and has he declar'd his passion?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>No, but as a preparatory step, he has given Lady Younglove (who is just return'd to town with her daughter) to understand, that for the future, she must not encourage my pretensions, as I have nothing to expect from him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>So! your hopes are all over in that quarter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Entirely! I called yesterday, to welcome my dear girl, my beauteous Flora, to London, and was refused admittance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>True, and I am now reduced to such distress, that, unless you can assist me with your advice, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Here's my hand,—Depend upon my utmost, I feel too much myself, tho' from a different cause, not to compassionate you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>I expected no less from your generous friendship, but how shall we act?—What can I do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word, I don't know.—I own yours is a critical case.—But, we must not despair,—I believe as matters stand, we had best work by stratagem. Luckily, I stand high in the estimation of your Uncle, as well as Lady Younglove.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>You'll find him inexorable, and her—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Not proof against flattery,—all mankind have their weak side, Woodford, and much may be done by taking a proper advantage of their follies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>I wish you may not be mistaken in the present case.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Never fear.—Let me see, <stage>(Panses)</stage> No, that won't do.—Stay, I believe I have it.—Suppose, I attack Lady Younglove myself, and persuade her, that I am dying for love of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>No, no, that's impossible,—'twould be too ridiculous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! I'll lay my life there's nothing easier.—Attack Widows by storm, and they can't resist you.—Besides, her time grows short, and as she was in such a violent hurry to get a second husband, there's all the reason in the world to imagine her still more impatient for a third.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>But what end do you propose by this scheme?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>To serve you, but in what manner I have not yet determined.—Come, let's home to my house and consider farther.—Nay, nay, no excuses.—I see you are unfit to be left to yourself.—And the heart which does not feel the distress of a friend, is not worthy of existence.</p>

<p>Seen! no, not if a Dutchess was to bribe me.—Then, I'll expect your Ladyship.—Lord, what time I have spent, prattle, prattle, never think, and yet, so much work!—Hurry, hurry, not a minute to lose—Your Ladyship's most obedient, humble servant.</p>
<stage>[Exit Fashion.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>This intelligence has given me new spirits—I protest, I began to be apprehensive that my charms were on the fade—A whole week passed, and not one new admirer.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Miss</hi> BELGROVE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>My dear Belgrove, you are come most opportunely—Do you know, that since I saw you last, I have made a fresh conquest?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>I don't find any thing so surprizing in that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Why no, that's true, but I have now rose a step higher, and captivated a Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Lord, or commoner, I suppose he'll share the same fate with the rest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, my dear, you would not have me be unjust.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>No, really, I would not, therefore entirely disapprove of your making such fools of them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>You mistake, child, the generality of them were fools ready made to my hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Some of them might be so, but I don't find you are in the least more favourable to men of sense.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="23"/>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I hate your sensible men, and take a particular pleasure in tormenting them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>That's very extraordinary.—But why so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Because it adds more to my reputation, to lead in chains one of those wise Lords of the creation, who has sense enough to know I use him ill, yet not power sufficient to break his fetters, than a thousand of those mincing, whiffling, trifling, good-for-nothing, pretty, Master Jessamys.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Well! tho' I shall never approve of your scheme, I almost wish for your spirits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Spirits, my dear!—Lord, what should put me out of spirits?—Time enough for me to pine and languish, when the Hey-day of my charms are over—Mine, I'm afraid, will be but a short reign, so am determin'd to make the most of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Then I find you do intend to marry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, some time or other.—. It wou'd mortify me prodigiously, to die an old maid.—No, no, I assure you, I have not the least ambition to lead apes, no more than I have at present to be led by one myself.—I wou'd only play with the male creatures, as a skilful angler does with his fish.—Amuse myself the sportive summer's day, bait my hook well for gudgeons, see the pretty innocents, nibble, nibble, nibble, as fast as I could cast in—Draw them out when I pleased—Stroke the delicate things, and then throw them in again—till evening sun having disagreeably lengthen'd my shadow, pick out the hero of the stream, and retire to my rustic cottage, content with the pleasures of the day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>But, pray, in the midst of this round of amusements, do you never feel a pang for the loss of Sedley?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>If I really thought I had lost him for ever, I should be heartily mortified.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Don't you think it begins to look like it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="24"/>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Why, I am a little alarmed,—for to confess the truth sincerely, which in those cases I very seldom do—Of all the men that ever address'd me, he is the only one who has made an imprestion on my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Why did not you use him better?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>'Tis not in my nature to be serious long together, therefore why should he expect it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Consider the many obligations you are under to him.—The many dangers he rescued you from, which your innocent levity exposed you to.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>That's true; but then he should not have taken so ungenerous an advantage of them, as to tell me, that I did wrong, and prescribe rules for my future conduct.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Were not those rules for your good?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but we are not always dispos'd to relish advice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>I really think, if you lose him, you'll never meet with such another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>If I am disappointed of him, I shall never have any other, that's past a doubt—And as a proof, were he now to return, I would frankly own, that, though I am innocent, even in intention of acting wrong, yet, my thoughtlessness, many times, leads me into great errors, which nothing but the sincerity of my heart can excuse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>'Tis great pity you did not make this declaration before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Psha! he must take me, as he finds me.—Can he be so unconscionable as to expect, that I should draw up my head, hold down my eyes, put my hands together, drop him a low curtesy, and say,—I have been a naughty girl to be sure, but, pray forgive me this time, and indeed, and double deed, I'll do so no more?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>No, but he might reasonably expect, that you'd dismiss your numerous train of followers;
<pb n="16" facs="25"/>—and, as you have often sacrificed men of worth at the shrine of folly, so in return, to make a general oblation—Offer up a hecatomb of fools, at the altar of discretion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Do I bid the creatures follow me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Nor don't you encourage them, when they do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Ay, that is, because I hate ill-nature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>But are not you afraid your reputation should suffer?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Oh, my dear, not in the least—Every thing we do becomes us,—Our very frailties are pleasing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Consider, the—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Positively, I won't consider about the matter—So, come along, and always remember these never-failing lines—</p>
<l>If to her share, some female errors fall,</l>
<l>Look on her face, and you'll forget them all.</l>

<p>I warrant I'll tow you along, if so be as how you'll keep above water.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Very well, I thank you, Captain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Give me your hand—here, Swab, help to heave me up—so, so—now, turn out, and keep a strict watch.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Swab.</speaker>
<p>If Bet Mainsail, my mess-mate's widow, hails me again, what answer shall I give her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Stow her hold well with right Nantz—Give her five guineas to buy new rigging, and tell her, if she'll hoist the sign of Admiral Boseawen on Portsmouth Common, I'll take care to keep her off a lee shore.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Swab.</speaker>

<sp>
<pb n="18" facs="27"/>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>You see I am laid upon the stocks a little, but no matter for that—Tho' my out-works are something damaged, yet my inside is heart of oak.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I am glad to hear it—Presuming, Captain, on the regard you always profest for me, I am now come to intercede in behalf of your nephew.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Avast, avast, tack about, and pay away no more of that cable—My nephew, d'ye see, is a lazy land-lubber—If he had taken my advice, I would have made a man of him, and taught him to hand, reef, and steer, with e'er a seaman in the navy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>These are accomplishments, Captain, not suitable to every man's taste and genius.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Then their taste is not worth a rope's end—I myself, tho' a younger brother, made my own fortune while his father was squandering away his—I was twice round the globe, before I was forty—In every birth, from cabbin-boy, up to Captain of the Terrible—And now, having sufficient to lie by, I am resolved to enjoy it, and ride in a smooth harbour all the rest of my days.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>But, Captain, tho' you was so fond of the ocean, and had such success, your nephew may not have the same inclinations, and you should make some allowance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>No, that's not my way—So, if he has a mind to gain the wind of my affection, he must sheer off from the little frigate he has so long kept in chace, and let me fit him out for a vovage in the Tempest, which sails in a few weeks for the East-Indies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Then your resolution is fixed—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>As the Poles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>And in his absence, I suppose, you intend attacking Miss Flora yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Right, I have some thoughts of bearing down that way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>But, Captain, don't the great disparity of years between you and her, deter you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="19" facs="28"/>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>No, the more danger, the more honour—Mayhap, you may think it strange, that after steering so long clear of a wife, I should, all of a sudden, veer about, and clap the matrimonial tack aboard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>He that's long at sea, will find the wind blow from every point of the compass—I have seldom been six months a-shore at one time, since I was a boy, so never had opportunity of coming a-long-side any but such as your Portsmouth or Plymouth fireships, who damage every vessel they grapple with.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>And them, I suppose, you avoided.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Why, ay—So, d'ye see, being lately weather-bound in a trip I made to take observation of some land that lay a-head of Lady Younglove's, I was forced to put into port at her house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Where you saw her beautiful daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>I did, and in the three glasses we staid there, she drew my heart with as strong an attraction, as ever the loadstone did the needle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Have you communicated your sentiments to the mother?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>No, not yet, but I intend shaping my course that way directly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I believe, Captain, I can be of service to you in this affair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>As how, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I am this moment going to pay my addresses to the mother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>What, the old hulk?—Ah, my boy, I'm afraid you are out of your reckoning there—You don't know the trim of her—She'll not be brought to obey either the helm, or the sheet, and if you'll take my advice, you'll e'en let her drop to pieces where she lies at anchor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I'll venture, however—The more danger, the more honour, as you say; and if you'll assist me, I don't doubt of succeeding.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20" facs="29"/>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, since the current of your inclination sets that way, I shan't attempt to stem it—thof, let me tell you, she saw her two former consorts go to the bottom, and if you don't take care, you'll share the same fate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I confess, I have a terrible prospect, but nothing shall deter me—If you'll suspend your visit, I'll return as soon as our interview is over, and in form you of my success.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, I shall lie by 'till then—But, harkye, Sedley! may I never strike an enemy's flag again, if I would not rather be rak'd fore and aft by a whole French squadron, than stand one broadside from such a Turkish pirate.</p>

<p><pb n="25" facs="34"/>
Where have you been, Frippery?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>Ordering a fresh quantity of your Ladyship's cordial, as you complained that the last was not strong enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>You are a good girl—Has that impudent fellow, Woodford, been here to-day?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>No, Madam; the answer your Ladyship gave him yesterday, will refer him from coming any more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>I am very glad of it—An unmannerly rake-hell, not worth a shilling, to have the asfurance to make love to a child before my face.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>'Twas monstraceous rude, indeed, Madam—Had he the sense to have paid his congratulations to your Ladyship, he might have been forgiven.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>True, Frippery; I cou'd much sooner pass over an affront of that sort offered to myself, than her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>That I am sure of— <stage>(aside)</stage>—Really, Madam, the exquisitive charms of your Ladyship would be a sufficient excuse for such an act of insensibility.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>O, fie, girl! how can you talk in such a manner?—What charms can a woman of forty be supposed to have?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>Fifty, would be nearer the mark. <stage>(aside.)</stage>—Your Ladyship certainly mistakes your age.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>How! mistake my age—Surely, hussey, you don't mean—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Madam; for by your looks, I should take my book oath, that you were not above five-and-twenty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Oh!—Why, I believe I do look very well for my years.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>Years!—Lud, Ma'am, how can you talk so abruptly?—As I am a woman of veracity, your Ladyship only looks like Miss Flora's eldest sister,
<pb n="26" facs="35"/>and are young enough to have half a dozen husbands yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>You are a merry girl, and always striving to divert your poor disconsolate mistress—Alas! my sweet, dear man has been dead above three months, and no one has said a civil thing to me yet.</p>

<p>Your Ladyship's most obedient—How shall I apologize for this rudeness, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>O, dear Sir! there is not the least occasion—I think you are very kind thus to visit a poor, distressed, afflicted widow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>You are goodness itself, Madam—I have waited on you now, my Lady, upon a very particular affair, which demands a few moments privacy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Frippery, you may retire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my Lady—Hem!—but by virtue of my office, I'll make bold to listen; so, wise Sir, you might as well have let me staid.</p>
<stage>(Retires to the side, and listens.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Now, Madam, that we are alone, can you forgive the folly, the presumption, the—call it what you please—which urged me on to this rash attempt?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word, Sir, I can't comprehend you.</p>

<p>And yet, when you shall know how long I have sighed in secret, how long been tortured with despair, before I dare pronounce the sacred name of love—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Love, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Madam; who could behold such beauty, and not adore?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="27" facs="36"/>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>So! Miss has got another lover, I find, but I'll soon silence him. <stage>(aside)</stage> Really, Sir, this is a language I must not suffer—'Tis highly improper for a child like mine to hear, these many years to come.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Child, Madam!—Is it possible you can mistake my meaning?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, was not all this designed for my daughter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>For Miss Flora, Madam!—No, as your Ladyship's daughter, she could not but have some charms; but I must be blind indeed, to offer up my vows to such a baby—You'll excuse my freedom, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Oh, readily, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>'Tis you, my Lady, who are the blooming Goddess of my adoration—Oh, how can I express the inconceivable torments of my breast, for those many years past!—During Sir Solomon's life, fear of offending tied up my tongue to a painful silence, and I was obliged to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>I assure you, Sir, I pity you, and had I known your sufferings, wou'd have contrived some method of softening them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I am transported to hear it—After his death, respect still sealed up my lips, 'till I found—for love, Madam, is Argus-eyed—that Mr. Woodford frequented this house, and was, without doubt, a favour'd lover—This made me resolve to discover my hopeless passion, wait his arrival here, and thro' a happy rival's bosom, force my way to that heart which kings might be proud to call their own!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Hold, Sir, you are in an error—'Twas not to me, but my daughter, his devoirs were paid.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, Madam, I cannot suppose Mr. Woodford so insensible, as to think of any other object, when you are present.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="28" facs="37"/>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>O, dear Sir, he has not half the complaisance you have!—What a charming man he is!</p>
<stage>(aside.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>My character, and family, Madam, you are no stranger to—My estate is considerable, and, if it is not too great a presumption, give me leave to cast both it, and a heart unalterably devoted to you, at your feet.</p>
<stage>(kneeling.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>O, rise, dear Sir—You overwhelm me with confusion!—Sure, you cannot possibly find any thing so attracting in a face, which constant grief has made such an impression on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley</speaker>
<p>Hem! Now for a little more nonsense. <stage>(aside)</stage> Come, my beauteous widow, cast aside these weeds of sorrow, and be arrayed in robes more splendid, and more becoming such a divinity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Impossible—I fear, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Impossble!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Almost, Sir—What will the world say of so hasty, so precipitate an act?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Umph! I find her coming. <stage>(aside)</stage> Love, Madam, will plead for all—'Tis a crime against his power to resist—Besides, enough you have sacrificed to sorrow—Three months at least.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, more—Sixteen weeks tomorrow—But, what are sixteen weeks, sixteen months, or sixteen years, to mourn the loss of so good a man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Come, Madam, no more of these melancholy reflections—The only remedy in the world for a lady's immoderate grief on the loss of a favourite, be it monkey, lap-dog, or husband, is to get another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir, I believe you are perfectly right—I remember, some years ago, I was utterly inconsolable on the death of a beautiful parrot, 'till the loss was supplied by an enchanting owl, which was presented me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Then let me, Madam, by the warmth of my passion, dry up your tears for Sir Solomon Younglove.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="29" facs="38"/>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Surely, Sir, you are uncommonly persuading—Well! to try your constancy, if you persevere in your intention, till my year of widowhood be expired, I don't know but I may be tempted to reward it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>A year, Madam!—An age!—For heaven's sake, my dear Lady, have some compassion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Believe me, Sir, I am very compassionate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Wou'd you have me die at your feet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>No, not for the world—Rather than you should do that, I will shorten it—to—to half the time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>She soon drops. <stage>(aside)</stage> Still, madam, I find you are cruelly resolved not to make me happy, therefore hopeless, and despairing, let me bid you eternally, eternally, adieu!</p>
<stage>[Going.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Stay, sir, stay—Must not I pay my last husband the same compliment I did my first?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>What was that madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Wait five short, short months.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Look you, my Lady, I would do as I would be done by—If you survive me, you have my consent to marry again the next day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>I confess, sir, you are the most reasonable man I ever met with.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>But, I see, madam, you are inexorable, so must retire, and in secret, lament my adverse fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Dear sir, stay—What can I say? I vow you are quite irresistible—Well, then,—though overwhelm'd with blushes—To-morrow, I consent to be yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Retard not my joy so long, but let this night crown my happiness—I see a kind consenting smile sparkle in your eye, and thus, I thank you <stage>(Kisses her)</stage> Oh, zounds! that was too much!</p>

<p>Who can withstand such rhetoric!—You have conquered, sir, and I surrender at discretion.</p>

<p>And now, my dear Lady, as our interests are to be one—If you give me leave, I can assist you in disposing of Miss Flora.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>You cou'd not oblige me more, sir, for, poor child! she seems in great haste to be married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Not so much as her mother, I'll be sworn. <stage>(<hi>aside</hi>)</stage> I think, my Lady, I could recommend one you can have no objection to—Captain Helm, your neighbour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Captain Helm—Do you think that possible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Nothing easier, if your Ladyship does not chuse to prevent it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>I prevent it; heavens forbid!—Poor dear child, it wou'd be a happy day for her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Happy, indeed, madam.—He has been raving about Miss, ever since his accidentally seeing her in the country, and longing for an opportunity of declaring himself—Nay, more—he knows of my visit to you, and hopes this evening will unite both parties.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>I'm sure I would do any thing in reason to secure her felicity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Captain Helm, madam, is prodigiously in love, vet has many odd whims, and like the element he belongs to, is very subject to change.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Oh, if he was once bound, we'd give him leave to change.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
<p>True, madam, therefore we had better make short work of it, and take him while he is in the humour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Well! do just as you please, dear
<pb n="31" facs="40"/>Mr. Seley—I am now your property, so dispose of me and mine, as you like.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I'll step directly to my lawyer's to prepare the deeds, then return with Captain Helm—Meantime, my lovely charmer! divest yourself of those beauty-veiling weeds, relumine the circle you were wont to shine in, and prepare to bless the happiest mortal in the world!</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>What a bewitching man!—But, there is not a moment to lose, I must set about making the necessary preparations immediately—Well, who could have thought when I got up this morning, that I should be a bride before night.—O, lud! a third husband is a happiness I never expected.</p>

<p>So!

<p>What do you mean, Frippery?</p>

<p>Why, his uncle, Captain Helm, who you remember visited us some time ago in the country.</p>

<p>What, that ugly old fright, who I compar'd to King Priam in the puppet-shew?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>The very idential man, Miss.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>Was there ever anything so ridiculous!—A husband, Ha! ha! ha!—O yes, to be sure he's a very proper husband for a girl of my age and spirit.—It is a wonder, Frippery, she did not think of a dancing bear for me—I'm sure, he's much the more agreeable and polish'd animal of the two.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Miss, I must say, that he's the most oddest, damphibious looking creature I ever saw—But your mama intends to make you have him, or not a penny of fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>A fig for fortune, say I.—Before she should sacrafice me to such a compound of age and infirmity, I'd bid adieu to all ideas of future grandeur,

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I did not care if she married a new husband every month, so she'd only let me have Mr. Woodford; and I'm sure that's not unreasonable.—But will you, my dear Frippery, in the mean time, endeavour to find him out, and let him know my distress?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>That I will, I'll ensure you.—Do you think I cou'd refuse any thing in my power, to help such a couple of true lovyers?—No, no, Frippery always does as she'd be done by—and, I'm sure all I wait for myself is,—the man to ask me the question.</p>

<p>Well!—Some girls now, in my situation, wou'd, in despair of relief, hang or drown themselves, and so put an end to their adventures at once. To be sure, my situation is very critical—Solely dependant on a mother—Denied the man I love, and obliged to receive the odious addresses of one I hate, are difficulties not easily surmounted—Yet, a good heart, and a fertile head, may do much—And if I do surmount them, I think I shall deserve a statue raising to my constancy and fidelity.</p>

<p>I must own your head is not the best in the world, but here you can't readily go wrong—Be fure you keep up to your part—Talk of the years you have been dying for her in secret—Flatter her charms to the utmost—Speak highly of your family and connections—If you should make some trifling blunders, I'll place them to the excess of your passion—The most pleasing excuse which can be given to a woman fond of adoration.</p>

<p>Upon my word, Mrs. Fashion, I am very glad you are come—You, perhaps, can explain this gentleman's meaning, which, I confess, is above my comprehension.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fash.</speaker>
<p>My dear, sweet Miss Belgrove—This

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>I beg your pardon, Mrs. Fashion, I did not know till now, that you kept a private madhouse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fash.</speaker>
<p>Ah, poor nobleman! he's greatly to be pitied—All this is a love affair, Miss—Gone quite distracted for love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>For love!—And are you so famous for curing mad people?—Now, I think I could recommend a magistrate for his doctor, who could much sooner restore him to his senses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Oh, your Ladyship mistakes him quite—As innocent as a new-born babe—But, pray let me attend you into another room.</p>

<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>I shan't stop—I only wanted to consult you about the choice of some Brussells lace.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>I'll wait on your Ladyship, at your own house directly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Whenever you are at leisure.—Mean time, let me advise that gentleman, not to be so violent in his raptures, before he is certain of the person he addresses them to.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Ah, you are a witty Lady—Nay, by my saith, I'll wait on you to the door—This is so great an honour to call <stage>(Turns and looks back at Flamwell)</stage> Ah! conjuror.</p>

<p>Was there ever so unlucky a dog!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Never—that I'll answer for—Nothing prospers you undertake—What the deuce could possess you to make so egregious a mistake?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flam.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! you—You knew I had never seen Miss Bloomer, and your declaring it was her, left me not the least room to doubt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Nothing could be more unfortunate!—The two ladies are intimate, and if a discovery should ensue, I am entirely ruined.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flam.</speaker>
<p>Can you think of nothing to prevent it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>I expect the real Miss Bloomer every minute—When she's gone, I'll wait upon Miss Belgrove, and endeavour to persuade her, that you really are a lunatic—And faith, if this affair fails, I shall be little better myself. <stage>(Knocking)</stage> Hark! I believe this is she, in reality—Away, and be in readiness, if I should want you.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>I am sure I can't blame the extravagance of Lord Flamwell's passion—And, by my faith, he swears he can't live without you.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Lord Flamwell!—Who is he, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="41" facs="50"/>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>The young nobleman, I told your Ladyship about this morning—Well, a sweeter, better humour'd, or more generous man, was never seen—Had you beheld with what transports he received the news of your coming hither.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Why, surely, you did not tell him any such thing?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Really, Miss, he look'd so piteously, I cou'd not help it—Oh, Mrs. Fashion, says he, if my beauteous angel will but consent to be mine, how happy shall I be!—My whole fortune shall be at her command—What pleasure shall I take in introducing her to my Sisters, Lady Lucy, Lady Sophia, and Lady Harriet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Bless me! the Gentleman seems to have a number of relations—But I have not time to lose about such trifles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Do you call breaking a nobleman's heart, a trifle?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Yes—to me the greatest trifle in the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Ah, you'll pay for all, one day or other—But, do now, give me leave to introduce him to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Who, me?—Not I, I positively assure you—'Tis your own house, you know, and if you chuse to do it—I can't help you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Well, I'll venture your displeasure—I'm sure you would not be the death of any person, nor discompose that sweet face of yours with a frown, for the world.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>What a fool am I, to be flatter'd by such a fulsome old woman—I am certainly an odd composition—to be pleased with what at the same time I so much despise—Now, for my Lord—If his heart does not speedily go pit-a-pit, and I don't make him as great a rool as I have dome the rest of my admirers, why I'll contess, I've lost the art of tormenting.</p>

<p>Hold, my Lord, we must be upon a more intimate footing, before I allow liberties of that sort.</p>

<p>I stand justly reproved, Madam, for my presumption, and own I merit the fate of—of—Icarus, who drove the Chariot of Apollo—Yet, if you'll but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha!—Your Lordship must pardon this emotion, which the profundity of your learning has involuntarily extorted from me—Ha! ha! ha! If I don't mistake, Icarus was a near relation of yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flam.</speaker>
<p>Of mine, Madam,—Yes—No, no, he has been dead, for ought I can tell, these—these hundred years past.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! I know it, my Lord, but you certainly are of the same family, and endeavour to imitate him, in soaring so high.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flam.</speaker>
<p>If I have committed any error, your charms, Madam, are a sufficient excuse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>True, my Lord, my charms have led many people into very great errors, and if you don't take care, you'll stand in the same predicament.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flam.</speaker>
<p>I wish it, Madam.—If I am so conspicuously happy, as to possess you, I shall be the envy of the gaping world—Adorable creature! behold, thus prostrate at your feet, the unhappy Lord Flamwell, who vows never more to rise, till you have put a period to his sufferings.</p>
<stage>(Kneeling.)</stage>
</sp>

<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>And that, I vow, my Lord, will never be.</p>

<p>Ah, the sweet youth! it brings tears into my eyes, to see what a condition love has reduced him to.</p>

<p>Pray, my Lord, let's have that speech
<pb n="43" facs="52"/>over again—Stay, you shall see how gracefully it comes from me in heroics.</p>

<l>Thus at your feet, Pomposo Flamwell lies,</l>

<p>I find she's an overmatch for me, every way.</p>
<stage>(aside)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Come, Miss Bloomer, let me put in a word for his Lordship—As I can answer for the sincerity and honourableness of his intentions, I hope you'll not stand on unnecessary punctilio—You see he cannot live without you—Reward his passion with your hand, and let me this evening, salute you Lady Flamwell.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flam.</speaker>
<p>Thou, more than Goddess! if you judge my fortune, title, or family, not beneath your acceptance, bless me with your love, and crown my wishes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Ay, I see a kind consenting look in these pretty tell-tale sparklers—Just so, I look'd myself, on such an occasion—By my faith, we'll have a wedding directly—Let your Lordship's Chaplain be call'd in, and the ceremony immediately performed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Hold, hold, pray let me get in a word with you—Look you, my Lord, I have not been used to such treatment, nor do I understand your meaning—As to you, Mrs. Fashion, I am surprized you don't know me better—But, be assur'd, as this is the first time I've been in your house, so it shall be the last.</p>

<p>Stay, charming, cruel tyrant, and take my life before you go.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>What use shall I make of it, my Lord?—You had better make a present of it to some other person, who prefers a title before understanding, and wealth beyond happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>My dear Miss Bloomer, how can you be angry with me?—If my Lord loves you to distraction, am I to blame, in endeavouring to promote your future felicity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="44" facs="53"/>
<speaker>Flam.</speaker>
<p>Then will you not give me leave to hope?—And must those charms, which like the sun dispense their refreshing beams around the celestial hemisphere, be only withheld from me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>My Lord, tho' I believe nobility and common sense very compatible, yet, as you are not happily possessed of both, forgive me if I decline your very generous offer—And, be certain, if ever I do resign my freedom, it shall be to a man who knows how to set a proper value on it.</p>

<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>No, not such an ignorant Devil as you—But, she shan't escape so—Ill after her, and endeavour to repair your mistakes, then make my last bold effort—So, prepare yourself—the conclusion of this business will certainly be a wife, or—a halter!</p>

<p>Well, Captain, what success?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Success!—Why, d'ye see, I believe I have steer'd by a wrong chart, and mayhap, if I don't tack about, I may chance to be wreck'd upon the shallows.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Oh, dear Captain, von must not mind
<pb n="48" facs="57"/>her—She's young and ignorant of her good—I was just so at her age, but she'll know better before long.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Why, to be sure, Widow, I do think she wants a little teaching, and will lay a wager, she does not know a cat from a capstan—But, no matter for that,—all in good time—patience is a good stream anchor—If I thought I stood fair for the harbour of her good-will, why, 'tis not a little squally weather, or variation of the wind, should hinder me from venturing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I'll ensure your successing—My Lady and I have entirely settled matters—At our return in the evening, every thing is to be finally concluded—You'll have your writings ready.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, I can produce the log-book of my estate at a minute's warning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>And, Captain, I think the greatest punishment you can inflict on your nephew for his disobedience, will be to oblige him to be a spectator of the ceremony.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I Own to you, Miss Belgrove, that, so far from being indifferent about Miss Bloomer, my heart never was more devoted to her, than at present—In vain, my reason shews the folly of my conduct, love has got possession of my soul with such absolute dominion, that every other passion bows to its resistless sway.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, you Lovers, are the most inconsistent set of beings in the world—Absolute contradictions—You love and hate, swear and forswear, whine and rage;—Resolve one moment, and break it the next—Tear the false image from your hearts this hour, and worship it with the grossest adulation the following one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I confess it, Madam, yet in me you'll not behold such a Proteus—I can love, without being blind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Impossible, for all lovers are blind, at least to the faults of their mistresses—But, no more of this—Take my word for it, Miss Bloomer is deserving of your best wishes, and, tho' I cannot entirely defend the sprightly, tho' sometimes, imprudent sallies of my fair friend; yet, I think them so venially agreeable, that they almost carry their excuse in the commission.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>And, yet, in the present case, 'tis certain she encourages the addresses of some designing rascal, who, probably wants to make a prey of her person and fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="52" facs="61"/>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>I own it looks like it—When I saw her this morning, she hinted a new conquest of a Lord, and by the circumstances, I suspect Mrs. Fashion of being the contriver of the whole design.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Have you seen Miss Bloomer since you left Mrs. Fashion's?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>No, I called at her house directly after, but she was not at home, upon which, apprehending some bad consequences, I thought the best thing I could do, would be to acquaint you, and request your assistance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>You oblige me infinitely, Madam—I'll unravel this villainy, or—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Stay, do nothing unadvisedly—Let me go again to Miss Bloomer's, and endeavour to learn whether she has seen this impostor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>You are right, Madam—But, pray, don't drop a hint of your suspicions—Conviction will come stronger, when attended with danger, and open detection—Meanwhile, I'll just step home, and be back time enought for your return.</p>

<p>Surely, I was born to be unhappy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I can't help saying, you deserve it—The next time I call at your house, you shall suffer me to be affronted in the manner I was last.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="53" facs="62"/>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>You have ample revenge, I can assure you—Oh, I shall never forgive myself, no, not if I was to live a thousand years, for being accessary to the death of so sweet, so lovely, so good-natured a gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Death! whose death?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>And yet, alas! I am innocent—'Tis those bright eyes alone, that have done all this mischief.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Oh, if that be all, I'll readily undertake to cure all the evil done by them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>No, no, he's too far gone to cure—He's a dying man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Dying!—Who in the name of wonder is dying?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Lord Flamwell—No sooner had you left the house, than, seiz'd with a fit of despair, he shut himself up in his chamber, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Rayed like a madman, then, when he was tired—let himself out again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>How can you be so barbarous!—But mark the consequences—He had searce been a quarter of an hour there, when we were alarmed with the groans of a dying person, and forcing the door open, found him weltring in his blood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Oh, heavens! is it true?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>A surgeon was immediately sent for, but on examination, he declared the wound mortal, and that nothing could save his life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>I am petrified with horror!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Oh! oh! oh! <stage>(crying)</stage> that ever I should live to see this day!—The sweet youth!—I loved him, as if he had been my own son!—What will his family say to me?—Oh! oh! oh! oh!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>But, are there no hopes of his recovery?</p>

<p>No, not the least—He can't live two hours!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Poor gentleman!—I sincerely pity him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="54" facs="63"/>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Ah! what signifies pity—If you would make him some amends for your cruelty, and condescend to visit him directly—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>I visit him!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Yes—consider can you be so hard-hearted as refuse him the only consolation he can receive in his last moments?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>You do not surely advise me to it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>From my soul I do—Dear Mrs. Fashion, said he, in faltering accents—Go to the unrelenting fair one, tell her, I die the victim of her obduracy—True, I was not worthy of aspiring to such excellence—But, if she will deign once more to look upon me, I'll implore her forgiveness, and, as a small atonement for my folly and presumption, request her acceptance of my fortune—That, though she could not love me living, she may compassionate my memory.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>His generosity affects me—I heartily with he may recover, but beg leave to decline his offer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>Really, Miss, I did not think you could have been so ungratesul—What harm can there be in visiting a dying man?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>I am abore suspecting any harm, but scorn to take advantage of his weakness for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>'Tis no advantage—What do his friends value the few thousands he can bestow?—Come, I must persuade you to accept them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Mrs. Fashion, though I am far from being void of humanity, yet upon this occasion you must excuse me; you may assure him, that, if wisnes—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fash.</speaker>
<p>No, no,—In all probability, he will not be alive in an hour's time—The very sight of you wou'd satisfy him, and then he would die contented.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>What shall I do?—</p>

<p>So! so!—These eyes of mine will be brought in guilty of murder!—Well!

<p>You need not fear, Miss, your Mamma's in too great a concatenation herself, tomind you; and she has sent all the servants out, about one fribalous thing, or other—However, to make sure, I'll stand centry myself for you, so make good use of your time, you young rogues.</p>

<p>My impatience would not let me wait the success of a scheme I had concerted with Sedley, this
<pb n="56" facs="65"/>morning; I was resolved to see you, so made use of my key of the gate at the end of the lane, to let myself into the garden, from whence I slipt up the back stairs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>You are too venturesome, yet, I'm glad you are come to my relief—My Mamma insists positively upon my marrying your Uncle to-night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>I know it, my angel, but we will disappoint her, if you'll consent to let me convey you to a place where we may be united beyond the power of separation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>I would run any hazard to avoid so hateful a union—And, yet, Woodford, should you behave unkindly to me, when I'm under your protection, it would break my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>He must be a villain indeed, who could wrong such innocence—No, rely upon my truth and honour—Let me but lead you from hence, now we have this favourable opportunity, and before we are missed, I hope we shall be far enough out of the reach of a pursuit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart—For, to confess the truth, I should like to be run away with into Scotland above all things—O lud! it will be so pleasant, so spirited, so fashionable, and make such a noise in the world!—Why, 'tis the very thing I have been wishing for, ever since I thought of marriage.</p>

<p>I am happy to find you so readily approve of it.</p>
</sp>

<p>O dear! there is nothing gives a girl the air of consequence an elopement does—To have one's name bandied about in all the newspapers in the kingdom, with "We hear, that yesterday morning, the only daughter of Lady Younglove eloped with a young gentleman of family, and great expectations—They were immediately pursued by the young Lady's relations, out in vain—The guardian powers of love and beauty had taken them under their
<pb n="57" facs="66"/>protection—Phaeton lent them his chariot, Cupid was the winged Charioteer, and Hymen on the opposite banks of the Tweed, with open arms, welcomed them into the dominions of joy and happiness!"</p>

<p>My charming girl!—How your words animate me—I hope the event will prove equal to our most sanguine expectations—But, let us not waste the precious moments—Come, and—</p>

<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>Stay, stay, not so hasty—Let me descend a little from my heroics to the level of common sense—Stop here a few moments, while I just step up stairs for some of my best cloaths.</p>

<p>No, no, my dear, we shall have no occasion for them.</p>

<p>Not for the world—You are the only jewel I wish to possess—Let us deal honourably, and trust to her generosity for the future.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>Then I'm afraid you'll trust to a broken reed.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>No matter, my love, we will put it to the test—I am sensible of the great hazard we both run by this precipitate step, which nothing, but the fear of losing you for ever, could urge me to—You, perhaps, have not considered it so seriously.</p>

<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>Why no, truly, I seldom consider about the matter—Reflection I know, will come time enough afterwards.</p>

<p>I must own, that I should like a coach prodigiously, but then I like you better—And if grandeur is only to be purchased at the expence of happiness,

<p>Nay, now, Miss Bloomer, I really think you are very wrong—Consider, what an advantage it will be to you.</p>

<p>O, Sedley! is it to you that I am indebted for this providential rescue?—'Tis doubly, doubly welcome.</p>

<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I am sorry, Madam, that I cannot return the compliment—Mr. Constable, conduct these villains to your own house, till they are properly examined.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir—Come along, my lads, don't be so down-hearted—You are not so bad now as you will be, that's some comfort—The gallows, you know, never can come out of season to you, and so, better late than never.</p>

<p>When we last parted, Miss Bloomer, little did I expect we should have met in such a manner—Give me leave to ask, what am I to judge from your appearance here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>The truth—that I was innocently decoyed here, by the wicked woman who keeps this house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Fain, fain would I believe so, did not other parts of your conduct contradict it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>My conduct, Sir, though faulty in this particular, is in every other respect irreproachable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I should be happy indeed, Madam, if you could prove it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Surprizing!—What right have you, Sir, to call my actions in question?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>None, Madam, none—The busy world has done it for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="64" facs="73"/>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Know, Sir, I rely on my own integrity, and despise what you or the world can say of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>It too plainly appears, Madam, that you have not the least regard for either.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Good heavens! but I will be calm—I see your artifice, you poorly seek an excuse for your own inconstancy—The oaths, the vows, the sighs you so long offered up to me, are now transferred to a more amiable, and deserving object—Lady Younglove, Sir, has sent me an invitation of the kindest nature—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I know it, Madam—Too long have I dangled in the train of a Coquette, but I am at last convinced, that the levity of your conduct, forbids me ever to hope the least happiness, with a woman of your gaiety.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Burst, burst, swelling bosom, ere I give you vent. <stage>(aside)</stage> O, Sir, you are convinced at last—'Tis very well, Sir,—I am satisfied—perfectly satisfied—Then you give me up for ever.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>For ever, Madam, by heaven!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Cruel, ungenerous, Sedley!—What have I done to deserve this insult?—especially from you, who of all men, I am least able to bear it from.</p>
<stage>[Weeps.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Tears! my heart can hold no longer—Madam, Miss Bloomer!—Heaven is my witness, I bleed to wound you thus—I love you! I adore you!—Had I millions they should be yours—But, what can I say?—Thus circumstanced, I am compelled, dear as I love, to bid you eternally farewell—Yet, though I am wretched, compleatly wretched, may the guardian powers of love and innocence, wait on your footsteps, shadow you with their wings, and conduct you to that happiness you have deprived me of.</p>
<stage>[Going.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Stay, rash man, stay—My pride forbids
<pb n="65" facs="74"/>me to stoop to a vindication—Yet, my weakness confesses, that had it not been for your present behaviour, I should have preferred you before all the men I ever saw—'Till this moment I knew not half the power you had over me—Yes, cruel Sedley, enjoy that triumph, but at the same time know, I will, if possible, tear your image from my breast, and bury myself where I may never hear your name mentioned.</p>
<stage>[Going.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Hold, my charming angel!—By heaven you shall not go—Thus on my knees <stage>(Kneeling)</stage> let me intreat for pardon—Forgive the man, who doats on you to distraction, who lives but in your smiles—Abhorred be my tongue for thus wantonly wounding your sensibility, and uttering what my heart disclaims.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>I am astonished!—And, are you really not engaged to Lady Younglove?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>By all the powers of love, I am not, nor ever will be—'Twas all an artifice, to serve my friend, and try the strength of your affection—If you refuse my hand, never shall it be the lifeless property of another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Generous man! I am not worthy of you!—No, Sedley, virtues like yours deserve infinitely more than I am able to bestow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Say not so, my beauteous girl!—You must, you shall be mine—My happiness is centered in you—Blest be the fortunate accident that thus luckily revealed I was not indifferent to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>And doubly blest let it be, since it has opened my eyes, and shewn me the glaring impropriety of my former conduct—What a dreadful precipice have I escaped!—How have I—But, my future life best shall speak my sense of the past—Here let me seriously renounce all former follies—Never from this hour, will I be guilty of them—You have at last effectually compleated the arduous
<pb n="66" facs="75"/>task you so long pursued—REFORMED A COQUETTE—And now, if you dare—take her for your pains.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>

<p>O transport inexprssible!—Am I at last rewarded!</p>

<p>Hey-day! may I believe my eyes!—Here's a change indeed!—Embraching!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>O, my dear girl! I am glad you are come.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Belg.</speaker>
<p>Really, so am I.—Your humble servant, Mr. Proteus, I am pleased to find you in such spirits—Not an hour ago, you was the resolute determined hero—No, no, Madam, I can love without being blind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>True, Madam, and without being entirely so; where could I six, but on so deserving an object? You seem surprized: let us adjourn to Lady Younglove's, and in our way thither, I'll let you into my whole design.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Here, take my hand—My heart has not been so much at ease a long time—And, if girls were but wise enough to consult their own happiness, instead of their trisling with fools and coxcombs, they would seek for it where it can only be found—In the arms of men of sense, and virtue.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>UPON my word, Miss, this is the most oddest affair I was ever extricated in during the whole current of my life—After getting so artificially off as you did, for Mr. Sedley to dissuade your lovyer to return you to your mamma again, instead of flourishing away to Scotland without redemption—Well! I own its above my compacity to find out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>Ay, or mine either—I'm sure, I never looked so foolish in all my life, as when I found we were not to be married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>And well you might, Miss, to have all your schemes confisticated in such a manner.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>And then, Frippery, to be disappointed of such a delightful jaunt, and exposed to the ridicule of all one's acquaintance—'Tis, enough to make me cry my eyes out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>Ay, my dear, so it is—And, pray, what end did he impose by this wise scheme?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>Why, as by such a precipitate step we should entirely forfeit the favour of his uncle, and my mamma, without the least chance of recovery, he persuaded Woodford to wait the issue of a scheme which he is going to execute immediately—For my part, if it does succeed, I shall lose half the pleasure I expected in being married in Scotland.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>You are right, Miss, and speak the sensations of most of the girls who go there—Why, I might have been married three years ago to Mr. Scraper, Lord Supple's footman, but that we could not raise
<pb n="68" facs="77"/>money enough between us to get there, and I was determined never to follow the vulgar fashion, of being asked in church.</p>

<p>So, my pretty runaway Miss! I have you safe once more, thanks to Mr. Sedley, and shall take care to keep you so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps you may be mistaken <stage>(aside)</stage> It is mighty well, mamma, but you would not like to be served so yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Go, hussey, you are a pert spoiled girl—Now, Frippery, after this last generous act of Mr. Sedley's, I think, I can't have the least doubt of his sincerity, truth, and tenderness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>Doubt, Madam! it would be downright fidelity even to inspect him of such a thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>How tediously the lazy minutes drawl, to a heart impatient of its bliss like mine!—Frippery, do you think I am elegantly enough dressed for my bridal day?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frip.</speaker>
<p>Elegant, my Lady!—Why, you are the very moral of gentility—Your new cork-rump becomes you mightily—And Mr. Friz, the hair-dresser, says, that your head is now at least half a foot higher than the handsome Duchess's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>I am glad of it—O, the dear, sweet man!—He promised to be here about this time—I wish he was come—My patience is almost exhausted, and I tremble left any accident should rob me of my expected happiness.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>Your Ladyship is too good—I should be vain indeed, were I to pretend to dispute a heart with one of your Ladyship's age and experience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! very pleasant—And yet, I really wonder, what the men can see in me so to follow and admire—Especially, when they sacrifice such youth and beauty—But, I hope no bad consequences will follow your disappointment—No hanging, or drowning—O lud!

</sp>
<sp>

<p>What a malicious devil. <stage>(aside)</stage> I hope, Madam, I have now removed every shadow of doubt which your Ladyship might have entertained of my sincerity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Entirely, Sir, entirely—And, in order to convince the world of my disinterested love for so deserving an object—Previous to the ceremony, which is to make me happy for ever—there
<pb n="70" facs="79"/>is a deed of gift— <stage>(Presenting it to Sedley)</stage>—properly attested, of half my fortune at present, and, the other half at my death.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>My dear Lady, what can I say to such unbounded, such unmerited proofs of your goodness?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Say! zounds, man, say nothing—The widow had rather be thanked in deed than in word.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I am afraid, Captain, it is not in my power to please the Lady either way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>O fie, Mr. Sedley, don't think so—I assure you I am not the unreasonable woman you take me for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I am glad of it, Madam, as I must speedily put you to the trial.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>I think, Sir, I can stand any trial you'll please to make.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I wish we may find it so, Madam—By your misplaced, and with justice I may say, ridiculous inclination, my Lady, for I cannot call it love, you have been so far blindly infatuated, as to make me sole master of your fortune without reserve—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>How!—Am I awake?</p>

<p>Well! I declare this is charming!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>

<p>So! we are all run on a lee shore, here!—Why, widow, you have kept a devilish bad reckoning—But I thought how it would be—As for your generosity, Mr. Sedley, in favour of my little cockboat, why, I heartily thank you—And, as soon as the parson can tip us a cocket, we'll steer away for matrimony harbour, directly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>I'm afraid, Captain, wind and tide are so much against you, that you'll hardly be able to reach the port this trip.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>How's this!—Do you refuse to take convoy too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>No, provided I chuse my confort—I'm sure, if I kept company with you, I should soon be obliged to take you in tow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Whew! <stage>(whistling)</stage> Here's a fresh gale sprung up!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>I think, Captain, you have kept a bad reckoning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>And now, Woodford, thanks to Mr. Sedley's
<pb n="72" facs="81"/>generosity, I have it in my power to manifest my love—Here, take my hand, my fortune's more than sufficient to enable us to live happily, though not splendidly—But, were it not, be assured, I would chearfully prefer poverty and a cottage, with the object of my choice, before riches and the most splendid palace with the man I dislike.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Right, Madam, the temple of Hymen was reared by virtue, and only occasionally embellished by Plutus.—Captain, I am sure, if you seriously consider every thing, you will soon be of the young Lady's mind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>May-hap not, for when I am resolved on doing any thing, I never think about the matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Dear uncle, make my happiness complete by restoring me to your favour—Recollect what a cruel constraint you were putting upon both our inclinations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>And, you young dog, do you recollect what a cruel constraint you are putting upon mine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>I know, Captain, you are a noble-spirited, worthy-hearted Briton—Only reflect, with such a great disparity of years and temper, what a ridiculous figure you must make united to so blooming a girl.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>Ay, for all the world, like David and Abishag, in our old tapestry hangings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Come, be generous, and act like yourself—Fill up the marriage settlements with your nephew's name, instead of your own, and receive the thanks, nay, the blessings of the young couple, for so laudable an act.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Upon my knees, uncle, let me beg—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Rise, you land spaniel—When did you ever see a seaman in such a posture?—Had it been for a brother tar, why, I should not have held council about it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Well! it is some comfort, to find others in the same situation with myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="73" facs="82"/>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>So! after rigging myself out for a cruize to the unknown islands, my orders are countermanded, I am to be dock'd, and laid up for life, as unfit for service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Swab.</speaker>
<p>Why, an please your honour, I do think your works are too much damaged, to venture out to sea again—You'd certainly founder in the first storm.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Do you think so, Swab?—Then let us tack about, and alter our course—Come hither, nephew, I forgive you what's past—You shall go master in my stead, and here are bills of freight and lading for the voyage—But, harkee, as you are a young seaman, take my advice—Don't crowd too much sail, or you'll be apt to overset.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>Never fear, uncle, I'll steer by your direction—your goodness to me on this occasion—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>No fair-weather speeches, but mind your business—And, d'ye hear, boy, by way of encouragement to serve his Majesty, you shall have a thousand pounds bounty money for every young volunteer you produce, as soon as ever they are able to cry, Huzza! King George and his navy for ever—Ay, damme! tho' you should have above the royal dozen!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>There spoke the true spirit of a British seaman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>What say you. Widow?—As we both have been a couple of ridiculous old fools, to make amends, will you join with me, and do the same?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Do the same, Captain?—I did not rightly understand you—You have not, surely, any notion of paying your addresses to me?</p>
<stage>(Crosses over to him)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>To you!—Avast there, sheer off——No, sooner than be tack'd to such a spit-fire, I'd turn a gun into my powder-room, and blow myself up.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="74" facs="83"/>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>A monster!—A savage bear!—Fit only for Greenland!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Well! a Greenland bear is better than a Lapland witch, at any time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Young.</speaker>
<p>Come along, Frippery—The men have neither eyes, ears, or understanding!</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Exeunt Lady Young. and Frip.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, let her have sea-room enough, or she'll run foul of some of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Swab.</speaker>
<p>Please your honour, since you are sharing the prize-money, I hope you'll not be angry if I put in my claim?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>What wind blows now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Swab.</speaker>
<p>A fair gale, your honour; if I can but press yon painter tender into service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Oh, are you in that quarter?—Have you a mind to desert your commander in distress?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Swab.</speaker>
<p>No, your honour, never while I have life—, she seems a neat tight-sailing thing, and her upper works are in such nice order, that I should like, of all things, to go master.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>But, hearkee, have you hail'd her yet, to know whether she'd chuse to take you on board?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Swab.</speaker>
<p>Why, no, your honour; I'm too good a seaman to launch out on so long a cruize without my commander's leave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Well, then, Swab, if that's the case, after her directly, and bring her too as soon as possible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Swab.</speaker>
<p>I warrant your honour; to give a good account of her—He must stand many a hard broadside that takes her from me.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Miss</hi> BELCROVE, <hi>Sir</hi> WHIFLING, <hi>and</hi> SPANGLE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Hey day! here's a Venetian galley, and a whole squadron of Turkish cruizers in full chace of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bel.</speaker>
<p>True, Captain, I have been oblig'd to ran for it, and glad to find this harbour open.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="75" facs="84"/>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Say you so, then let me stand in—I'll soon make them tack about, and sheer off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bel.</speaker>
<p>No occasion, Captain, I'll stand my ground now, and face them—Well, good folks, I see by those smiles that are seated on your countenances, that every thing is happily settled—I give you joy—I met these gentlemen in my way hither, they would not believe me, so are come to receive their dismission from your own lips.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Span.</speaker>
<p>Is this true, my dear girl, that you have the inhumanity to be the death of all my hopes?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Whif.</speaker>
<p>And can you, Miss Bloomer, behold my sufferings without a touch of pity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>The time has been, gentlemen, when I could have play'd on your follies, and encouraged them with the highest pleasure—At present, I am disposed to be more serious—Therefore, in a word, I beg I may not be honoured with your addresses more, as you may rest assured, that I never will give you, or any others, the least encouragement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Span.</speaker>
<p>And this, my dear, is your positive resolution?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Positive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Span.</speaker>
<p>Upon my soul, my dear, I am sorry for your taste—But to shew you how fashionably easy I am, under my disappointment—May elegance renounce me, if I ever ask you again—So, ladies and gentlement, wishing you all happiness, I have the honour, sans ceremonie, to remain, till my latest moments, your most devoted humble servant.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit, humming a tune.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha!—As to you, Sir Whifling, I hope your philosophy will teach you to bear this event with equal resignation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flora.</speaker>
<p>O, I'll answer for my uncle——Give him another antedeluvian cockle-shell, and he'll renounce the sex for ever.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="76" facs="85"/>
<speaker>Sir Whif.</speaker>
<p>Not so pert, Miss—Madam, your frankness charms me—I begin to perceive that I deserve ridicule for the folly of my pursuits—But, to shew you, that, tho' I am old, I am not incorrigible, I'll from this moment bid adieu to all thoughts of love, and devote the remainder of my life to more noble studies than either brickbats, cinders, or mutilated statues.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>Now, Belgrove, are not these genuine fruits of reformation?</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> FINESSE. [<hi>On seeing Sedley and Miss Bloomer, attempts to retire</hi>]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Ha! Monsieur Finesse, come back—Why in such a hurry?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>Je demande pardon for my intrusion—You be upon de private business—Je revendrai demain, I'll come again to-morrow.</p>
<stage>(Going)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<stage>(stopping him)</stage>
<p>No, Sir, the present time will do better—Hearkee, villain! what motive cou'd induce you to destroy my peace, by your infamous misrepresentations of Miss Bloomer?—No evasion, wretch! <stage>(drawing)</stage> or this moment shall be your last.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<stage>(kneeling)</stage>
<p>O dear Sir! prenez garde!—Consider how soon you may frighten a pauvre Frenchman out of his wits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bloom.</speaker>
<p>What, my admirer, Monsieur Finesse, is it to you I am so much indebted?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Madame! have pitie!—I confesse, I have been von grand rogue—But, je vous en supplie—I beseech you to forgive me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>Rise!—A moment's reflection shews me that you are a wretch beneath my resentment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>I'l est vrai—It is true. indeed, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>Hearkee, suppose we tar and feather him, and then send him home to his own country, to parlez vous with his relations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="77" facs="86"/>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>By no means, Captain—But, hence from my sight, let me never see you more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fin.</speaker>
<p>Vous me faites trop d' honneur—You do me too much honour.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>The Frenchman, of character and probity, I admire and esteem—Virtue is not confin'd to clime or complexion, its radient emanations illumine every nation—Yet still, I would not fashionably encourage the resuse of foreign countries, while native merit lies buried in oblivion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Bel.</speaker>
<p>So, Captain, you and I seem the only disconsolate, unprovided creatures in the whole group—We certainly should make a match of it, to complete the evening's entertainment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>No, no, fair Lady, you have some other land in view—As for me—But, no more of what's past—Let us enjoy the present moments.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodf.</speaker>
<p>And look forward, uncle, to those scenes of bliss which open to our view.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Helm.</speaker>
<p>True, Boy, and as this seems but a bad harbour to anchor long in, let us all steer away for my cabin, where you shall have the best cheer an old bachelor can give, and as hearty a welcome as the bravest sailor in the navy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
<p>We accept your offer, Captain, happy in having our adventures brought to so agreeable a conclusion—I only beg leave to remark—That though our follies and vices justly deserve the comic lash—Yet, when, instead of persevering, we nobly acknowledge our errors, and amend—Satire then loses her sting, our foibles turn to virtues, and, the most permanent felicity arises from THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART.</p>
