<p>AMANA. A Dramatic Poem.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>THE story of this piece is taken from the moral and ingenious writings, lately published, stiled THE ADVENTURER, Numbers 72 and 73. But the Drama, which was too much confined in the fable, has been inlarged here, by the addition of four persons, namely, NARDIC, ABDALLAH, FATIMA, and HAMET. For tho' NARDIC, and ABDALLAH (SANBAD, in the original) are mentioned in the story, they are not introduced into the scene.</p>
<p>Some other alterations have been made in the fable, in order to accommodate the representation to a British audience: the machinery of genie's has been laid aside, and the catastrophé brought to pass without the declared interposition of superior agents: the time and place too, have been restrained, to preserve two of the unities. Shakespear alone could <hi>call spirits from the vasty deep</hi>; he was himself a superior intelligence; could create beings not to be found in nature or fable, could rock ages to sleep to hasten his events, and <hi>annihilate both time and space,</hi> to bring the history of a man within the representation of a day.
<l>"Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,</l>
<l>"And panting time toiled after him in vain."</l>
But modern wits are no more able to stride in Shakespear's buskin, than modern beaus to shoot in Ulysses' bow.</p>
<p><pb n="iv" facs="3"/>The moral, professed in the original story, is, <hi>To shew the folly of human wishes and schemes for correcting the moral government of the world</hi>; which sentiment is preserved here in a speech of Amana's.</p>
<l>O Nouradin!</l>
<l>Forgive this fatal rashness—Had I staid</l>
<l>A few short moments, we had now been blest;</l>
<l>But wresting from the hand of providence</l>
<l>The means of my escape, we both are wretched.</l>
<p>But I confess that the reflections which occurred to my mind most strongly, on the perusal of this tale, were a tender and humane resentment of the miseries of those nations which are subject to despotic power, and an exulting sense of the peculiar blessings of liberty, that we enjoy in these thrice happy kingdoms.</p>
<p>The contemplation of this contrast, both suggested and inspired the plan of the following writing; in which I have endeavoured to contribute my grateful mite of praise to those laws, and to that government, under which our superior advantages are established, defended, and preserved; and however the presumption of this attempt may be condemned, I hope that the faults of the performance may be pardoned, as the first essay of</p>

<div1 type="dedication">
<pb facs="4"/>
<head>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE The Countess of <hi>Northumberland.</hi></head>
<opener><salute>MADAM,</salute></opener>
<p>I Beg leave to lay at your ladyship's feet a work, which from the spirit of liberty it attempts to breathe, may hope for the honour of your patronage. Your ladyship's own character justifies this address, and the names of PERCY and SEYMOUR demand it. History is my voucher, and fame my herald. Liberty was their crest, and Glory their motto.</p>
<p>BUT such an heroic subject is beyond my strength, and I shall content myself with praising and admiring the more social and amiable virtues of your ladyship, your humanity, benevolence and affability; which latter quality is the characteristic of true nobility, in opposition to that haughtiness which is frequently observable in those who have sprung from obscurity—Those who are placed on an eminence may <hi>descend,</hi> but those on a level would <hi>rise.</hi></p>
<p><pb facs="5"/>IF this little work, the offspring of a female and unlettered pen, shall be so happy to amuse your ladyship for half an hour, it will afford the highest satisfaction to the author, who humbly presumes to hope, that your ladyship's candour will pardon whatever defects your judgment may find in this piece, for the sake of those sentiments it is intended to convey.</p>
<closer><signed>I have the honour to be, With the profoundest respect, and humblest duty, MADAM, Your most humble and obedient servant, ELIZA GRIFFITH.</signed></closer>

<l>At once abandoned heaven, and my country,</l>
<l>Renounced both worlds for my Amestris' charms.</l>
<l>O liberty! thou first, best gift, to man</l>
<l>Bestowed in Paradise—Nature's creation</l>
<l>Subject to him, himself without controul,</l>
<l>Except to heaven alone. Thus, thus derived,</l>
<l>We claim it as our birth-right. Yet, O shame!</l>
<l>Whole nations have resigned this right divine,</l>
<l>From heaven revolting, yet submit to man.</l>
<l>Albion alone preserves the blest Palladium,</l>
<l>Where every power of doing good is free,</l>
<l>And peasants may defend their rights from kings.</l>
<l>A second Eden in religion also,</l>

<l>Yet I a renegade to each advantage,</l>
<l>Tho' born a Briton, bred a Christian too,</l>
<l>My creed, my country, for a woman's love</l>
<l>Did forfeit. True indeed, my paradise</l>
<l>I have enjoyed below—But vengeance sure</l>
<l>Tho' slow, hath now o'erta'en, and my Amana</l>
<l>Is marked a victim for her father's crime.</l>
<l>Yet still, just heaven! If sin may be attoned</l>
<stage>kneels.</stage>
<l>By deep contrition, weigh my penitence,</l>
<l>Nor shed the parent's guilt upon the child.</l>
<l>Oh! rather let me live while nature's powers</l>
<l>Admit existence, in that life be cursed</l>
<l>With pain, with penury, with every ill</l>
<l>To vex the mind, or torture human sense:</l>
<l>Extend those evils to my latest gasp,</l>
<l>And purge my apostasy with wounds and death!</l>

<l>Why did I part with her! Why not sustain</l>
<stage>starting up.</stage>
<l>The Sultan's cruelty, and Caled's vengeance!</l>
<l>Oh! had they hewed me piece-meal, what could they</l>
<l>Have done, but kill'd me! And I now must suffer</l>
<l>A thousand, thousand deaths! But fear for her</l>
<l>Unmanned my nature quite—For in the strife,</l>
<l>They might have injured her. There, there I died—</l>
<l>Torn from my bleeding heart where is she now?</l>
<l>Perhaps encircled in the Caliph's arms!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>Stay that ungenerous thought—tho' born a slave,</l>
<l>My daughter ever hath been bred a Briton;</l>
<l>Nor will she condescend to live on terms</l>
<l>Which her chaste soul abhors—From earliest youth,</l>
<l><pb n="19" facs="30"/>She has been taught to know that life is dowerless.</l>
<l>Without virtue: stript of that rich portion,</l>
<l>One lot alone remains—to die with honour.</l>
<l>Therefore believe Amana still a virgin,</l>
<l>Or no more—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nouradin.</speaker>
<l>Why dost thou seek to aggravate my sorrows?</l>
<l>I hoped Amana's heart might be at peace,</l>
<l>That wealth, that grandeur might have bought her smiles,</l>
<l>And left me only, wretched—Oh! 'tis false!</l>
<l>Vile treason against love! That heavenly maid,</l>
<l>Within this hour, declared she only lived</l>
<l>For Nouradin—Then let me instant fly,</l>
<l>To save her from pollution: this good sword</l>
<l>Lodge deep in Osmin's breast—or in my own.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>My son, attend. A thought has quick occurred,</l>
<l>Which may perhaps, redeem us from despair.</l>
<l>The captain of the guards, his name is Hamet,</l>
<l>Was once a well tried friend of mine: honest,</l>
<l>Sincere and brave; strict bound in gratitude,</l>
<l>For services, no matter now to tell.</l>
<l>And if the modes of court have not erased</l>
<l>All generous feelings from his aged breast,</l>
<l>He will both pity, and assist our purpose.</l>
<l>Should he but lend his aid, I yet have hope,</l>
<l>Of rescuing Amana from perdition.</l>
<l>But, oh! he never felt a father's anguish,</l>
<l>Nor did his heart e'er bleed as mine does now!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nouradin.</speaker>
<l>O! lose not time in fruitless doubts or fears.</l>
<l>But fly this moment, and strong urge your suit;</l>
<l>Use every argument that thought can frame,</l>
<l><pb n="20" facs="31"/>To bind him to our friendship: if my wealth</l>
<l>Can buy his service, let him take it all,</l>
<l>And pay me with one sight of my Amana.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>Thou need'st not seek to press a father's haste</l>
<l>To save an only child; for tho' no raptures</l>
<l>Now fire my blood like yours, more generous passions,</l>
<l>Rage 'gainst oppression, with parental fondness,</l>
<l>Have made my heart as brave as his who dares</l>
<l>The cannon's roar in battle. But my son,</l>
<l>Know that the adventure is most hazardous;</l>
<l>Therefore with caution let us now proceed,</l>
<l>Entreating heaven to bless the pious deed—</l>
<l>And if we fail, I am prepared to bleed.</l>

<l>Who slaked his thirsty soul with sweet revenge.</l>
<l>But much I long to know how did Amana</l>

<l>From all the dangers of the sullen night—</l>
<l>And O! if virgin thoughts as pure as snow,</l>
<l>May hope for favour from ye, send a dream</l>
<l>Of Nouradin, my lost, my hapless lord!</l>
<l>Let him be present to my sleeping eyes,</l>
<l>Whom waking I shall never more behold,</l>
<l>Or in these faithful arms again enfold;</l>
<l>In gentlest whispers let him breathe his love,</l>
<l>Then sighing leave me like the widowed dove.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Osmin.</speaker>
<l>I Have safely passed thro' all the several gates,</l>
<l>And windings of these spacious courts, and trod</l>
<l><pb n="45" facs="56"/>In paths I never traced before—This door</l>
<l>Leads into the serrail, and brings me near</l>
<l>The summit of my joy—Why do I not</l>
<l>Anticipate my bliss, feel all o'er rapture?</l>
<l>No—I despise myself for such mean arts,</l>
<l>To put on this disguise, and counterfeit</l>
<l>A vassal's semblance thus, to gain—a Woman!</l>
<l>Curse on the vulgar passion that enslaves us,</l>
<l>Which ever is at war with reason's laws,</l>
<l>And so fortuitous, we scarcely find</l>
<l>Two hearts united in one mutual flame,</l>
<l>While adverse loves still jostle one another.</l>
<l>Oh! 'tis the plague of man—and woman too.</l>
<l>But what are they? The very sport of nature;</l>
<l>Formed solely for our use, like the fair flower</l>
<l>That blooms but to be cropt, then cast away.</l>
<l>Now let me haste to rifle its perfume,</l>
<l>Then loath the withering stalk. <stage><hi>opens the door, out of which</hi> Caled. <hi>rushes and draws his sword.</hi></stage></l>
<l>Ha! what art thou!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caled.</speaker>
<l>Beyond my wish, beyond my utmost hope,</l>
<l>This lucky incident hath intervened—</l>
<l>I thank thee, gracious Alha! thou poor wretch,</l>
<l>As thou hast raised, art bent to fix my fortunes.</l>
<l>Thy head shall shower down honours upon mine.</l>
<l>This instant I'll convey it to the Sultan,</l>
<l>Who highly will reward me for the prize.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osmin.</speaker>
<l>What means the frantic slave? Avaunt, and know</l>
<l>Thy Sultan stands before thee—Quick retire,</l>
<l>Or instant death shall quit thy insolence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caled.</speaker>
<l>Think'st thou thy ravings can affect my brain?</l>
<l><pb n="46" facs="57"/>The shades of night are not so far advanced,</l>
<l>But I can spy the heroe Nouradin,</l>
<l>Who for a girl's caprice, so bravely struck</l>
<l>His late dependant, his superior now.</l>
<l>The conference 'twixt Hamet and Abdallah,</l>
<l>I guessed might be for some such hopeful purpose,</l>
<l>And therefore, quite beyond my line of duty,</l>
<l>I have attended to this pass; and now</l>
<l>Shall make thy bridal robes thy funeral weeds.</l>
<l>Resistance all is vain, therefore submit.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osmin.</speaker>
<l>Thus then I recompence thy officious duty.</l>
</sp>
<stage>they fight, are both wounded, and fall.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Caled.</speaker>
<l>Thou hast reached my heart, but well I think my sword</l>
<l>Hath met with thine—Thou shalt not triumph long,</l>
<l>Nor reap the fruits of thy rebellion—Oh!</l>
</sp>
<stage>dies.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Osmin.</speaker>
<l>Too sure his weapon has been busy here—</l>
<l>My heart impatient of the least controul,</l>
<l>Full of indignant rage opposed its point,</l>
<l>And now I bleed to death. Oh! the disgrace,</l>
<l>The shame that will attend my memory,</l>
<l>When I am found disguised, and by a slave</l>
<l>O'erpowered, in mean attempt to win a vassal!</l>
<l>This—this wounds deeper than the fatal steel.</l>
<l>Curse on the wayward sex—Curse my tame folly—</l>
<l>And oh! Curse—</l>

<speaker>Nouradin.</speaker>
<l>To that blest providence which hitherto</l>
<l>Hath led my unerring steps thro' all the turns</l>
<l><pb n="47" facs="58"/>And mazes of this palace, I with awe</l>
<l>And reverential gratitude, here bend.</l>
<l>O! power benign! continue thy protection,</l>
<l>And grant the arduous enterprize success.</l>
<l>Unless my speech betray me, the deep gloom,</l>
<l>Which now involves the world, will safe conceal</l>
<l>The honest fraud. Hamet desired me strike</l>
<l>Thus on the floor, when I would be attended.</l>
<stage>he stamps, and enter a female attendant.</stage>
<l>Go bring Amana to my presence straight,</l>
<l>And upon pain of death, let none else enter.</l>
<stage>exit attendant.</stage>
<l>To gain this mighty realm I'd not endure,</l>
<l>But for another day, the strong emotions</l>
<l>Of hope and fear, which agitate my mind.</l>
<l>But 'tis an higher prize than wealth or power,</l>
<l>That stirs up my ambition—'Tis Amana,</l>
<l>Whose love rewards my hazard and my pains.</l>
<l>I had forgot that Hamet bid me enter</l>
<l>The close pavilion at this gallery's end;</l>
<l>Where Osmin still employs his vacant hours,</l>
<l>In amorous dalliance with the alternate fair;</l>
<l>And whither none uncalled, dare come. 'Tis here—</l>
<stage>going to the side of the stage.</stage>
<l>I cannot calm my spirits—My full heart</l>
<l>Beats at my breast, as if to force a passage</l>
<l>To my beloved, my betrothed Amana—</l>
<l>An universal tremor shakes my frame!</l>
<l>Sure 'tis the approaching joy of seeing her,</l>
<l>That makes this tumult here. I must, I will</l>
<l>Indulge my flattered soul in the fond triumph</l>
<l>Of seeing her disdainful hate of Osmin,</l>
<l><pb n="48" facs="59"/>Quick change to tenderest love for Nouradin.</l>
<l>Would this important hour were past—</l>
<l>I will retire, and wait the wished event.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Amana.</speaker>
<l>Why did you wake me from the sweetest sleep</l>
<l>I ever yet enjoyed? My Nouradin</l>
<l>Soft called Amana, bid me rise and walk;</l>
<l>Straight I obeyed, and on he led my steps</l>
<l>To the Elysian fields; or if there be</l>
<l>A place more beautiful, 'twas there—While he</l>
<l>With converse fond, but chaste, engaged my ear,</l>
<l>And sighed out vows of never ceasing love.</l>
<l>He promised too, that we should part no more,</l>
<l>But smile at tyranny, and death defie.</l>
<l>Oh! 'twas a dear delusion!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Attendant.</speaker>
<l>'Twas no more—</l>
<l>The Sultan has this moment summoned you</l>
<l>To attend his pleasure in the close pavilion;</l>
<l>Else I had not disturbed your happy slumber.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amana.</speaker>
<l>The Sultan, said you? What! is he returned!</l>
<l>Did he not promise me a poor two days,</l>
<l>And is this pittance now curtailed to half?</l>
<l>But what's a day, a week, a year, to me,</l>
<l>Whose fate's already fixed, and soul resolved!</l>
<l>Then why should I resent this breach of faith,</l>
<l>Or start at hastening from the griefs I feel,</l>
<l>And speeding to the land of peace and rest?</l>
<l>Retire a while, I shall obey the Sultan.</l>
<stage>Attendant retires to the back of the scene.</stage>
<l><pb n="49" facs="60"/>Now, now, Amana, summon all thy courage—</l>
<l>What means this chilling damp that clings around me!</l>
<l>Why do I tremble thus! my tottering limbs</l>
<l>Why should they now refuse their wonted aid!</l>
<l>A little longer, and I shall not want it;</l>
<l>But pale and cold stretched on my parent earth,</l>
<l>No longer be a burthen to myself.</l>
<l>Can love of life have power o'er the unhappy!</l>
<l>Or shall a wretch who languishes in prison,</l>
<l>Refuse to be set free? The instinctive voice</l>
<l>Perhaps of nature, pleads too strongly here,</l>
<l>And silences the stiller pleas of virtue.</l>
<l>But cannot love inspire my timid sex?</l>
<l>Shall I be led a willing sacrifice</l>
<l>To gratify a mean and gross desire!</l>
<l>O never! Death has lost its terrors now.</l>
<l>This cordial draught shall lead me to his arms,</l>
<l>To peace and Nouradin— <stage>drinks.</stage> 'Tis done, and now,</l>
<l>Fear, hope, and every passion of the soul,</l>
<l>Are all extinct, but love—That still remains,</l>
<l>And in my latest moments will prevail</l>
<l>In prayers and blessings on my Nouradin.</l>
<l>What strengthening power hath braced my sinews thus?</l>
<l>'Tis love, 'tis hope, 'tis immortality!</l>
<l>Lavinia come—Attend me to the Sultan.</l>

<l>Approach, my fair, nor longer now delay</l>
<l>Thy suppliant monarch's bliss, whose fond impatience</l>
<l><pb n="50" facs="61"/>Hath urged him to infringe his royal word,</l>
<l>And make a sacrifice to love, transcending far</l>
<l>What he requests from thee. Reduce him not</l>
<l>To win by force, what he would owe to favour—</l>
<l>Believe me the rich bounties of thy love,</l>
<l>Shall not be spent on my sole luxury,</l>
<l>But treasured in my heart, to be repaid</l>
<l>With grateful use, to purchase joys for thee.</l>
</sp>

<l>Banish those vicious hopes, and know that I</l>
<l>Nor dread thy power, nor supplicate thy pity.</l>
<l>Thou see'st no more the weeping, trembling maid,</l>
<l>Who late implored thy grace—But one who comes</l>
<l>To dare thy rage, and prove its impotence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nouradin.</speaker>
<l>Whence comes this boast? What means the frantic fair!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amana.</speaker>
<l>She means to pour out her whole soul before thee,</l>
<l>Its love, its hate, without disguise or fear;</l>
<l>To curse thee tyrant from her wounded heart,</l>

<l>May every joy of which thou hast deprived him,</l>

<l>May long and happy days attend him here,</l>

<l>Dost thou indeed refuse to go with me!</l>
<l>Has bondage then such charms, or has thy tongue</l>
<l>Belied thy heart in feigning generous love,</l>

<l>O! cease to wound me by unkind suspicion!</l>
<l>My heart is wholly thine—The last sad drops</l>

<l>Not mine indeed, but heaven's avenging hand</l>
<l>Hath struck this heavy blow—The Sultan's vice</l>
<l>Hath earned his fate—For tyranny should bleed!</l>
<l>But these unhappy innocents were doomed</l>
<l>For my foul crimes, my vile apostasy;</l>
<l>For quitting heaven, and native liberty—</l>
<l>Let those who dwell in Albion's happy land,</l>
<l>Grateful acknowledge heaven's most bounteous hand:</l>
<l>Its choicest boon in freedom is bestowed,</l>
<l>And their best praise to its protector owed;</l>
<l>Who not in Britain's cause alone sustains</l>
<l>The toils of council, and of hostile plains:</l>
<l>The world's great champion, born for all mankind,</l>
<l>In whom the oppressed a certain refuge find:</l>
<l>Whose sword, but like the lancet, wounds to heal,</l>
<l>Where moral lenitives can nought avail;</l>
<l>Whose olive bearing laurel peace restores,</l>
<l>And calms the discord of contending powers.</l>
