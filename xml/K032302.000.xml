<p>MAR-PLOT; Or The Second Part of <hi>The BUSIE-BODY.</hi> A COMEDY. As it is Acted at the THEATRE-ROYAL in <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> BY Her MAJESTY's Servants.</p>
<p>Written by Mrs. <hi>SUSANNA CENTLIVRE.</hi></p>

<pb facs="2"/>
<head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE <hi>HENRY BENTINCK,</hi> EARL of <hi>Portland, Viscount</hi> Woodstock, <hi>Baron of</hi> Cirencester, <hi>Captain of Her Majesty's First Troop of Guards,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
<opener><salute>My LORD,</salute></opener>
<p>WOmen, and Men like Women, naturally fly to the Brave for Protection. This Pretence <hi>Mar-plot</hi> and I have for Addressing to your LORDSHIP. We know it is the peculiar Distinction of Noble Minds, that they are ready to receive under their
<pb facs="3"/>
Care the Distress'd, though they have no other Merit, than that they beseech their Patronage.</p>
<p>When I say this, my LORD, I wou'd not be understood to conceal, that my <hi>Play</hi> has been very kindly receiv'd; but we Women overlook all Praise, but from those Persons whose Approbation we most esteem. We are apt to be carry'd away from Admirers to those we Admire: And this <hi>Comedy</hi> prefers the Honour of being thrown at Your Feet, to the Applause of an Audience. It is the Misfortune of our Sex, that we are deterr'd from the Advantages of a Learned Education: But as our Expressions are Artless, our Sentiments are less Disguis'd. Had I, my LORD, the Skill of a Writer, I shou'd here record your Noble Father's Zeal for his Royal Master, and celebrate that Care and Fidelity which preserv'd the Life of Our Deliverer: But, instead of mentioning this Obligation, which my late Lord <hi>Portland</hi> laid on every Man in <hi>England,</hi> I confine my self to what we owe Him for being your Father.</p>
<p><pb facs="4"/>That Your LORDSHIP may long bless the World with the same Virtues which You have shown in the Entrance You have made on the busie Stage of it, and long enjoy the Advantages of an Affluent Fortune, Graceful Person, and Generous Mind, is the ardent Prayer of,</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<l>THE Men of Wit do now their Brains fatigue</l>
<l>So much with Politicks and State-Intrigue!</l>
<l>That there's not one Male-Poet of the Age</l>
<l>Will condescend to labour for the Stage.</l>
<l>Therefore our Author, tho' no <hi>Rules</hi> she knows,</l>
<l>What Nature prompts, with Artless Hand bestows:</l>
<l>You'll see the <hi>Subject</hi> for the <hi>Genius</hi> fit,</l>
<l>A <hi>Busie-Body,</hi> drawn by Female Wit,</l>
<l>Still on the Hunt to know of others Wooing,</l>
<l>Eternally employ'd, and nothing doing!</l>
<l>Into dear Secrets anxiously they press,</l>
<l>Destroying, even where they wish Success!</l>
<l>The scanty Age all better Fare denies,</l>
<l>And no new Characters the Town supplies.</l>
<l>Some Years ago Wit had a larger Field,</l>
<l>And every Room cou'd fresh Stage-Coxcombs yield;</l>
<l>But long has been all Humorous Folly crost,</l>
<l>All Fool in empty Politician's lost.</l>
<l>Scowrers, and Rakes, and Debauchees are o'er,</l>
<l>Beaux are extinct, and Bullies are no more.</l>
<l>Therefore in Scarcity of home-bred Tools,</l>
<l>Your Treat to Night's compos'd of Foreign Fools;</l>
<l>And tho' our <hi>Mar-plot</hi> has been shown before,</l>
<l>The Fool may differ, on a different Shore—</l>
<l>For once, then, break old Custom; be not o'er-nice,</l>
<l>But let the <hi>self-same</hi> Woman please you <hi>Twice.</hi></l>

<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>WHY Brother, you are distracted; how often have you fill'd my Brain with these Chymera's? Why should I murder my Wife without a Cause?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>A Cause! Do's a Cuckold want a Cause?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Per.</speaker>
<p>Look ye, Senior, keep that Word Cuckold between your Teeth, till you can prove me such, or by St. <hi>Anthony</hi> you shall feel what Mettle my Spado is made of. <stage>[Laying his Hand to his Sword.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>Name your Spado again, and I'll shake thee into Dust, thou feeble Dotard. Your Spado! employ it against the Man that robs you of your Honour, and not against him that would preserve it. I say, My Sister, your Wife, is a Strumpet, the Strumpet of a damn'd Heretick: I saw the Looks, nay the Signs, she gave some of the <hi>English</hi> Officers, as she came from Church this Morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Per.</speaker>
<p><hi>English</hi> Officers!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p><hi>English</hi> I'm sure they were, I can't swear they were all Officers, nor cou'd I perceive which she sign'd to, or he shou'd not live to meet her Wishes—Now if you don't like the Name of Cuckold, find another for the Husband of a Whore, if you can—For my part I know of none; but this I know, if you won't punish her as a Wife, I will as a Sister; she shall not stain
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
the Honour of my House this way; she injur'd it too much in marrying you. I shall pursue my own Method, and so Farewell. <stage>[Going.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Per.</speaker>
<p>So, there's the Blessing of matching into an honourable Family: Now must I bear all Affronts patiently, because I'm but a Merchant, forsooth—Oh, give me any Curse but this—Pray, Senior, give me leave to speak one Word with you: I am convinc'd of my too much Indulgence for this very Cockatrice, and there remains nothing to quicken my Revenge, but certain Demonstration.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>Certain Demonstration! Must you have Ocular Proof? Must your Coward Heart be animated with the Sight? A Curse of your Equivocations—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Per.</speaker>
<p>No, any other Sense will serve; let me hear 'em, feel 'em, nay, smell 'em; and sure Cuckoldom is so rank a Scent, that, tho' I liv'd in <hi>England,</hi> where they scarce breathe any other Air, I cou'd distinguish it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Lop.</speaker>
<p>Now you talk like a <hi>Portuguese</hi>; keep up this Passion, and secure the Honour of your House and mine, and deserve the Alliance of my Blood, it shall be my Care to fix them.</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Charles, <hi>meeting Colonel</hi> Ravelin.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Colonel <hi>Ravelin!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p><hi>Charles Gripe!</hi> honest <hi>Charles,</hi> how dost thou do, Boy? Why, what brought thee to <hi>Lisbon?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Part of the Cause that brought you, Colonel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>What? art thou in the Army?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>No, Colonel, I leave Honour to you, Interest brought me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>They are Twin-Brothers, <hi>Charles</hi>; if Interest did not drive, Honour wou'd come slowly on: Art thou turn'd Merchant then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>No, faith, not I; but it pleas'd Heav'n to take my Wife's Father out of the way, who left me Executor, and his Concerns here oblig'd me to take this Voyage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>So then, old Sir, jealous Traffick is dead at last. How long do you intend to stay?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Longer than I expected when I embark'd: I came away in such a Hurry, the Ship sailing sooner than I thought she
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
wou'd, I forgot to put up some Papers, without which I can't adjust my Accounts with some Merchants here; I have writ to my Wife to send them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>That was very unlucky; prithee, how dost thou spend thy Time?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Why very insipidly: How do you pass yours? What Company have you here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>All sorts; the Women, I'll say that for 'em, are kind enough, and won't put you to the Expence of Swearing and Lying to gain them; but a Man is as safe in an Engagement, as in their Arms; Fortune is the kind Friend in both the Onsets: But I have got acquainted in a <hi>French</hi> Family, which are not altogether so dangerous one way, but much more so another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Ay! how's that, Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>Why, I'm fearful of dwindling into an honourable Amour there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Exert your Gallantry, gain your Point once, and those Fears will vanish. The <hi>French</hi> Ladies are easie of Access.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>Right, the <hi>French</hi> Gayety resembles the <hi>English</hi> Complaisance, yet they have always a Reserve to dash your Expectations, and when you think your self in a manner Master of their Cover'd-way, they spring a Mine of Coquetry, and blow you up at once.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Say you so, Colonel? Why then give me the <hi>Lisbon</hi> Dames, that surrender to the Bold and Brave: He deserves not a Woman, that would not run some Hazard, provided she be kind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>Some are of Opinion, that the jilting Fair gives the surest Blow, and <hi>Sucklin</hi> says, <hi>'Tis Expectation makes the Blessing dear.</hi> This <hi>French</hi> Woman has found the way to unite my jarring Inclinations, and tune 'em to the pitch of Constancy, and I am very apprehensive of becoming that tame Monster, call'd a Husband. Ah! I find I am caught, for I can name that terrible Word without starting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! I shall have you in my Class: Sure the Lady that can make such an entire Conquest over your Heart must be a Person of extraordinary Parts, Colonel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>Yes, faith, her Ladyship has very extraordinary Parts; she's airy to Affectation, and changeable as the Wind: She has
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
Tongue enough for a Lawyer, but as hard to be understood as an Apothecary: She begins as many Stories as a Romance, and ends them as intricately, or, to speak more properly, seldom ends them at all: She's as whimsical as a Projector, as obstinate as a Physician, and as faithful as the Monarch of her Country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Admirable Qualities for a Wife; and can you forsake the whole Sex for this Woman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>Humph! that I won't swear; but I find I can't forsake her for the whole Sex: To be plain with you, I have try'd the Strength of Variety, and at this time am in prospect of the Favour from as fine a Woman as any in <hi>Lisbon</hi>; yet this Medly of Womankind triumphs over all, and in the midst of my Raptures I murmur <hi>Joneton.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>But may I not see this wondrous Engineer, who can countermine her whole Sex, and blow up the Magazine of your Affections, Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>You shall, but you must give me your Honour not to rival me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>The Description you have given, Colonel, secures you from that Fear; besides, you know I am marry'd, neither am I destitute of a Mistress, tho' in a strange Place. I this Morning was a assur'd, by a Sign from a Lady's Hankerchief, that my Wants shou'd be supply'd upon Occasion. I did not rightly understand her, till the good old <hi>Duena</hi> explain'd her Meaning; and this Night I shall be happy in her Arms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>You are a Stranger to these Affairs <hi>Charles,</hi> take heed, proceed with caution, for the Women here are as warm in their Revenge as in their Inclinations, bare Suspicion justifies Murder; if you manage your Intreague so closely to escape the Husband and Relations, 'tis odds but your Mistress finds some pretence to employ her Bravoes, Fellows that will dispatch a dozen Men for a <hi>Moydre.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>I go well arm'd, understand the Language, and will not easily fall a Victime, but resolve to see the event of this Intreague; the old Matron told me that the Lady was young and beautiful, her Husband a Merchant, rich, covetous, old, and ugly; that she hated him worse than Penance, and lov'd me better than her Prayers; shall I be such a Poultroon to decline a Lady's Summons? No, for the honour of <hi>Britain,</hi> it shall never be said an <hi>Englishman</hi> fled either from the Wars of <hi>Mars,</hi> or
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
<hi>Venus</hi>; let her bring me on, if I discharge not my self with Honour, and make my Retreat secure, may I forfeit the Embraces of the Sex.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>Well said <hi>Charles,</hi> in my Conscience you married Men encroach too much upon our Prerogative methinks; you who purchase pleasure by way of Annuity, should leave us Batchellours the liberty of the Freehold.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>The Ground we course in, is never the worse for your Use.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>No, 'tis sometimes the better; there's many a Wife lies Fallow, and many a good Estate wou'd want an Heir, if it were not for us young Fellows, especially Soldiers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>I think you ought to make Provision for the Recruits you raise, as much as for your Widows, they are far more Numerous.</p>
<stage>[A noise of clashing of Swords, and Murder cry'd within.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>Ha! What noise is that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>'Tis <hi>Mar-plot</hi>'s Voice, his damn'd Curiosity has brought him into some Mischief, I'll lay my Life on't.</p>
<stage>[Draws.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>The Devil's in that Fellow; what made you bring him with you?</p>
<stage>[Murder cry'd again within.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Murder, murder, <stage>[Mar. <hi>running pursued by two Bravoes.</hi></stage> Ah <hi>Charles,</hi> help me dear <hi>Charles,</hi> for Heav'ns sake.</p>
<stage>[They beat off the Bravoes.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>A Curse on your Paper Skull, what have you been doing now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Nothing at all, as I hope to be saved; only I had a mind to see where that Lady liv'd that shook her Handkerchief at you, and out of no other design than to inform you, I protest, <hi>Charles,</hi> when immediately these two Scoundrels came slap upon me, I know no more for what than the Child that's unborn; but I'm sure I shall feel their blows this Month, pox take 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>For what? Why you took the only method in the World to have your Guts let out: Ha, ha! watch a Woman in <hi>Lisbon</hi>! Hark you young Gentleman, suppress that natural Curiosity of diving into other Peoples Affairs, or never hope to see old <hi>England</hi> again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>I wish I were safe in it, Colonel <hi>Ravelin</hi>! The duce take me if I saw you before, my Senses was all in such a hurry, with these unconscionable Villains, that—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>That you over-look'd your Friends, I warrant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>You have said it <hi>Charles,</hi> but I hope the Colonel will forgive me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>To be plain with you, Mr. <hi>Mar-plot,</hi> I shall take these kind of Over-sights for particular Favours, if you don't shake off that Temper of yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Pish, prethee Colonel don't put on those grave Airs, why what harm is there in't?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>There's ill Manners in't, I'm sure, and have a care you han't your Bones broke for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Look ye <hi>Mar-plot,</hi> you must either resolve to quit this inquisitive Humour, or forfeit my Acquaintance,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>A Man may be ruin'd by your foolish Quarrels.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Upon my Soul, Colonel, I never quarrel'd with any Man, out of design to hurt him in my Life: <hi>Charles</hi> can witness for me, that I hate fighting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>So can every Body else that knows you; I wish you hated Impertinence as much, for the good of Society.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Well, you of all Men living have the least reason to complain; I have run the hazard of my Life many a time for you, and in my Conscience I believe I shall fall your Martyr one time or another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Your own you mean, you'll certainly be Canoniz'd by all the Busie-body's about Town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Is this all the thanks I get for my Friendship? Well <hi>Charles,</hi> well, you shall see I can prefer Safety, and sacrifice my Curiosity too, as you call it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>That's the way to oblige your Friends, Mr. <hi>Mar-plot,</hi> never desire to know more than they are willing to tell you, readily comply with a reasonable Demand, and never meddle with any body's Business but your own, this will render you agreeable to all Companies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Ay! But that will make all Companies very disagreeable to me. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage> But Colonel, is there nothing due from one Friend to another? One ought to be let into the bosom Secrets of a Friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>Not always, for there are some Secrets of such a Nature that will not admit of that Freedom; for Example, suppose your Friend had an Affair with another Man's Wife, or Daughter, where's the advantage of your knowing it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Why I wou'd watch the Husband or Father in the mean time, prevent his being surpriz'd, and perhaps save his Life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>But how wou'd you save his Honour? A Man of Honour must have no Confidents in those Cases.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Then hang Honour, I say, 'tis good for nothing but to spoil Conversation. Shall I beg a pinch of your Snuff, Colonel?</p>

<p>So, you have been at Church to Day, my Dear, have you not?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>Nay, ask your Brother <hi>Don Lopez,</hi> who will have it that you send your Eyes a merroding for <hi>English</hi> Forage; my Dear, have a care of an Ambuscade; for the whole Artillery of his Senses are drawn down upon you, and Jealousie leads the Force of his Invention; and though I love you, Wife, yet if his Spies bring certain Intelligence of your holding Correspondence with those Heretick Dogs, the <hi>English</hi> Officers, I shall infallibly treat you like a Traitress to your Lord and Husband.</p>

Officer; so far I'm not forsworn. <stage>[Aside.]</stage> I thought, my Dear had promis'd me never more to mind the Insinuations of that cruel Brother; his Prejudice is founded on our Marriage, his proud imperious Temper scorns your Alliance, and racks his Soul to find a Cause to ruin you: And must it be by blasting of my Fame? Will not my Life suffice? And dares he not employ his own Hand? But wou'd he make you guilty of my Murther? oh barbarous inhumane Thought!</p>
<stage>[Weeps.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Cruel <hi>Don Lopez,</hi> now do I wish I may die a Maid; a terrible Wish, were I not out of Danger of the Curse falling upon me; if I believe my Lady ever thought of any Man but your self, Senior. Poor Creature, I'm sure her Heart is full of Fears about you when you are absent.</p>

<p>In your Sight.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>The Man is certainly a Witch. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>

<p>That wou'd be as bad on the other side.</p>

<speaker>Dona Per.</speaker>
<p>For my part, Deary, I'm never happier than when thou art in my Arms, and cou'd be content to have thee always there.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dona Per.</speaker>
<p>What wou'd you have me say, my Dear, to convince you of my Love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>Look ye, Wife, 'tis no matter what you say, do but take care what you do: No regaling your Pallate with Foreign Dishes, they are very dangerous. Take my Word for't, you'll live longer upon your own Food, and with less Danger of your Health.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if Diseases are prevented by dry Meats, he's in the right on't. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dona Per.</speaker>
<p>I know not what you'd have me say, my Dear; but if you think me false, confine me to my Chamber, or send me to a Monastery. Grant, Heav'n, he do's not take me at my Word. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>I wou'd not give a Crusada for my Place, if he shou'd; a cloyster'd Mistress brings no Grise to the Servant's Mill. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>Sure <hi>Don Lopez</hi> do's belye her; I always found her thus pliable, kind, and modest; however, I'll watch her narrowly. In the mean time, to take off her Suspicion, I'll seem to believe her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>So, all's right once more, I see by that Ogle of his. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>Come, my Love, dry thy Eyes; I am not jealous, nor shall thy Brother make me so; I'll be an <hi>Englishman</hi> to thee. Come, buss thy own Husband then, do Deary.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>Yes indeed, and indeed, I will, you little coaxing Thief you. By St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> thou dost look wondrous handsome methinks. Od! if I were not to meet some Merchants about Business, thou should'st to Bed this Moment.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>But for two or three Hours, my Dear; and then I will so buss it, and love it, and hug it, and squeeze it.</p>
<stage>[Kisses and embraces her.</stage>

<sp>

<p>Thou shalt quickly have me again, my Jewel.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="17"/>
<speaker>Dona Per.</speaker>
<p>I think I had better let it alone; do you consider the Hazard which I run?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Hazard! Are you born in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and talk of Hazard? Why, there is not a Woman in <hi>Lisbon</hi> that wou'd not run twice as much for such a Fellow—Do you consider the Difference between him and your old Husband?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dona Per.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and what I must suffer too, if I am caught.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, if Fear throws so many Bug-bears in your way, follow your own Fancy: I'm like to make a fine Penny on't truly—Pray send me of no more Fool's Errands; I'll carry no more Challenges, if you do not mean to engage: I trifle my Time away sweetly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dona Per.</speaker>
<p>Nay, don't be angry, <hi>Marget</hi>; 'tis not but that I have as much Inclination for that handsome Man as ever, were I sure not to be discover'd, I shou'd not alter my Resolution.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>That shall be my Care, I warrant you, Madam; he comes in by a Rope-Ladder at your Closet-window, by which he may return with Secrecy and Expedition upon the least Surprize.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dona Per.</speaker>
<p>My Closet-window looks upon the River, how can he come that way?</p>

<p>By a Boat, that shall wait to receive him again.</p>

<p>I hope you have a better Opinion of my Country, Seniora, than to think me afraid; but where is the Lady? the beautiful young Lady, which you told me off, my dear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>She's forth-coming, Sir—So, see what it is to be stricken in years now, he looks over me, as if I were a thing of his own Species. Well Senior, I assure you I have done you no small service with my Lady, poor young thing, she had so many scruples, but I told her a thousand things in your Favour: Seniora said I, the Cavalier is a fine Cavalier, he is—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Oh the Devil, if this old Woman's Clack sets a going, there will be no end—I understand you Senior, pray give me leave to thank you; and to engage you more heartily in my Interest, be pleas'd to accept this Token of my Esteem.</p>

<p>Ah Seniora, you <hi>English</hi> have excellent faculties to please us Women; I'll swear they have exceeding good natural Parts, and readily conceive our Meaning, <stage>[Aside.]</stage> I'll acquaint my Lady that you are here, Senior.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Prethee do—So, I am enter'd, but how I shall come off, I am not able to determine: If instead of a Lady, there shou'd come an old surly Dog, with half a dozen Bravoes at his back, it would give a strange turn to my Inclinations; how foolishly a Man must look upon such an Occasion; egad suppose some Body should be doing me the same favour in <hi>England</hi> now with my Wife, cou'd I be angry?

<p>You seem surpriz'd, Senior.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Who can look on such amazing Brighness without astonishment of Sense? <hi>Semele,</hi> when <hi>Jove</hi> approach'd her in all his Glory, had not more cause to be surpriz'd.</p>

<p>You begin as if we had years to waste in Courtship, Senior, pray descend from your high-flown Raptures, the Gods are no Example, let us talk like Mortals.</p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha; what, do you start at a Dagger, Senior?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Yes, in a Female Hand, those Limbs were made for softer Uses; and we <hi>Britains</hi> are not wont to see our Ladies arm'd with Steel: Loves Combats are fought with Kisses, in my Country, I know not what his Laws are here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dona Per.</speaker>
<p>The Engagements are the same, only a little difference in the Preparation; a Wound in the Reputation of an <hi>English</hi> Woman, they say, only lets in Allimony, but with us it lets out Life: And therefore, tho' we proceed with caution, a Lover ought to think us sincere, when we run such hazards to receive him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>But to what end is the Dagger, Madam; is it to dispatch your Lover by way of keeping the Secret—faith he'll have but small stomach to Eat, that knows he must Die as soon as he has Din'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dona Per.</speaker>
<p>No Senior, by this I wou'd imprint in your Mind the danger which we are both expos'd to, if we are not both discreet; Favours in <hi>Portugal</hi> must not be boasted off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Nor any where else, Madam; a Man of Honour scorns so poor a piece of Treachery; he that owns he ever had a Favour,
<pb n="16" facs="22"/>
proclaims himself both lewd and foolish, but he that points the Woman out is a Villain, and ought to have that Dagger in his Heart.</p>

<p>Ah! that was all a Mistake, Sir; I did not know what I said, Sir, nor, I believe, did not know what I meant, and I'm sure I did not neither, except I meant my self, Sir. Nay, now I think on't, I did mean my self, Sir—Oh Lord, oh Lord, which way shall I come off? <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>

<p>I am very subject to an itching in my Nature to know every body's Concerns, and being thrust out of an Officer's Lodgings of my Acquaintance, for my Impertinence (as he call'd it) I suspected he had some Intrigue on foot: So I watch'd his coming out; but finding he shut himself up, I imagin'd he had got his Mistress with him. So, Sir, I found means to get in again; but not meeting with him, I fancy'd he had some private way up the Chimney. So, Sir, my confounded Curiosity, with a Pox to't, must needs try to smell him out—So, Sir, I turn'd my Coat here to save it clean, and up I scrambl'd; but when I came without-side, I saw no body there then: Sir, something whisper'd me in my Ear, that he might be gone down the next Chimney: So, Sir, that devilish Desire of mine brought me down hither, as you see, Sir; and this is the Truth, and nothing but the Truth, as I hope for your Pardon, Sir—Ah, poor <hi>Mar-plot,</hi> if this brings thee not off, thou art undone for ever. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>

watch his Opportunity to press my Wife to the Service, and think to raise Recruits out of my Family: And for you, sweet Senior Sweep-Chimney, the <hi>Corrigadore</hi> shall let you into the Secrets of our Laws in <hi>Portugal.</hi></p>

<stage><hi>Enter Colonel</hi> Ravelin <hi>and</hi> Charles.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>HA, ha, ha; certainly this Fellow is the most mischievous Rogue that ever liv'd; which way got he down the Chimney?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Nay that's past my finding out, as also what's become of him: I cou'd have cut his Throat with all my Soul just then, and yet I can't help being concern'd for him now, I fear he is kill'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>I shou'd be sorry for that, tho' in my Conscience he deserves it, this busie humour of his is as natural to him as his Food; he follow'd me home this Morning, I was forc'd to use him very roughly to get rid of him, for you must know, I have a trap Door in my Chimney, thro' which I descend into a back Street, where I am conducted by an old Negro to an Angel of a Woman; I had her Summons, and the hour of Assignation was come when he enter'd my Chamber.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>A very unseasonable Visit, faith Colonel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>Ay, was it not? but I quickly dispatch'd him, tho' how he stumbl'd upon you afterwards, and in so odd a manner, is a miracle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>If he lives we shall know when next we meet; I never catch'd him in a lye, which is the best Qualification he has: But Colonel, did not you promise to introduce me to your <hi>French</hi> Mistress? What, this Lady <hi>incog.</hi> has not beat her out by the by, has she Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>No, no, she maintains her Ground too well, there's more danger of my raising the Siege, than her beating the Chamade; she has so many retreats of Pride, Vanity, and Affectation, that without some lucky Accident toss a Granade into the Magazine of her Inclination, there'll be no hopes of the Town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Storm then, Colonel, storm.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>I rather chuse to block her up and starve her out, suffer no Admirer to enter; and if once a Woman of her temper want the Provision of Vanity, she surrenders of course.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="26" facs="32"/>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>An admirable Stratagem, but prithee let me see her before you put it in practice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>It shall be now, if you please, <hi>Charles.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>With all my Heart: Is it far?</p>
</sp>

<p>Lead the way then.</p>
<stage>[Exeunt.</stage>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mar-plot.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Lead the way—where the Devil are they going? now can't I help having a violent desire to follow them, tho' I scap'd so narrowly in my last Project: Yonder they go, ha! they are enter'd already, that is no publick House I'm sure: Egad, may be it is some private Bourdell, or what business can both of 'em have at one House? Well, <hi>Charles,</hi> tho' you was so barbarous to desert me in my Afflictions, I won't serve you so, I'll not stir from this place 'till I see you safe out—Od, upon second thoughts I'll knock at the Door, and ask for him, perhaps three may be as welcome as two.</p>
<stage>[<hi>As he is going to knock, enter</hi> Isabinda <hi>in Boys Cloaths.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Ha! <hi>Mar-plot</hi> here, this is lucky. <stage>[Aside.]</stage> Mr. <hi>Marplot,</hi> fortunately met.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>That's more than I can tell yet, for I don't know you, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Nor wou'd I have you, <stage>[Aside.]</stage> But you know those that do; can you tell me where Mr. <hi>Charles Gripe</hi> is to be found?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Ha! my Mind misgives me plaguily that this is an Envoy from the old Man's Wife, pray Heav'n he has never a Summons from my old Matron too; for tho' I comply'd with all she ask'd to purchase my Liberty, I am sure I shall have no Stomach to perform Articles. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Don't you hear me, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, Sir, I hear you—What the duce shall I say to him, he must not know that <hi>Charles</hi> is gone into yon House; for Women here, they say, are cursed Jealous, and that may be a means to have his Throat cut. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Why don't you answer? where does he Lodge?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Where does he Lodge?—this must be some new Intreague, for doubtless t'other knows his Lodgings: Look ye, Sir, one good turn deserves another; let me know what business you have with him, and accordingly as I like it, your Question shall be answered.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="27" facs="33"/>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p><hi>Mar-plot</hi> still, I find he's no changling. <stage>[Aside]</stage> Why then, Sir, if you must know, I have a Letter for him from a Lady who is desperately in love with him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>So, here's another Intreague popt into my Mouth. In Love with him? prithee dear Youth who is she? where does she live? What's her Name? Is she Maid, Wife, or Widow? Young, or Old? Black, Brown, or Fair? Short, or Tall? Fat, or Lean? this Country, or a Foreigner? quick, quick, quick my dear little Rogue, let me into the secret, and I'll carry thee to his Lodgings immediately—Egad this Discovery will make my peace with <hi>Charles</hi> compleatly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I can only answer him these questions, Sir, I am no Blab, you must excuse me if I'm silent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>So must you me, Sir, I'm no Blab neither, Sir, if you go to that, I'd have you to believe I can keep my Friend's secrets when intrusted; I don't know his Lodgings, find them out as you can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>You are very short, Sir; I have nothing to say against your secrecy, but it wou'd be Impudence in me to run the hazard, besides forestalling your Friend's Generosity, he ought to have the disposal of his own secrets.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Ay, if it comes into his Hands once 'twill cost me more pains to find out? than 'tis worth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Pains to find out? I hope you never endeavour to find out what other People wou'd conceal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>No? yes to chuse; why the duce shou'd any Man know more than my self? We came into the World alike, and I can see no occasion for his superior knowledge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I admire you are not for levelling Estates too; how can you bear any Man to be richer than your self?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Oh with ease, my Wealth lies in my Mind, I had rather fathom the depth of a Man's Thoughts, than his Pockets; yet to show you I can suppress my Curiosity, let me read the Letter, and I'll excuse the rest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>It is as much as my Life's worth to open the Letter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Pox take his Life—tell me what's in't then, or may I be carbonaded if you know his Lodgings. I'd give a Finger to have this Intreague rightly. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I must not let this Fellow know me, if I intend to conceal my being in <hi>Lisbon</hi>; I'll humour him a little, and try what
<pb n="28" facs="34"/>
discovery I can make. <stage>[Aside.]</stage> Well, Sir, if you'll promise to be secret, I'll let you into this Affair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Secret as a Priest, Child—Egad I shall have it, pray Heav'n <hi>Charles</hi> does not come out before he has done, if he shou'd I should be undone. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Why then the Lady I belong to, is a rich Merchant's Daughter, near the Convent of <hi>Santo Vincente,</hi> her Name is <hi>Dona Cephisa,</hi> she saw your Friend at Church, is extremely charm'd with him, and resolves to marry him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Marry him! ha, ha, ha, ha, poor Lady! why now to return secret for your secret, he's Married already, but perhaps he may prick her down amongst the rest of his Mistresses: You understand me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Too well—the rest of his Mistresses? has he such store then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>As many as he can well manage, I believe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Oh my Heart, the danger of intreaguing in this place alarms my fears, and shocks my very Soul.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>What I have said makes you thoughtful, I perceive; will no Body do but <hi>Charles</hi>? What think you of me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Why really, Sir, were I a Woman, I shou'd prefer you before him, but I can't answer for my Lady; if you please I'll mention you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Your most humble Servant, Sir,—Egad there may be new pleasure in having an Intreague of ones own, for ought I know, for I never had one in my Life. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>But, Sir, there is one Article in our Agreement which you have not perform'd,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>What's that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Where your Friend lodges?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Why he lodges at yon green Windows, where if you have any Service from your Lady for your humble Servant, you'll find me there also.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Sir I kiss your Hand, I'll do my best to serve you.</p>
<stage>[Ex.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I kiss yours—I'm glad he's gone before <hi>Charles</hi> came out; this is a Nonsensical Secret, tho' methinks I had rather know what the Colonel and he is doing in yon House—Shall I knock at the Door or not? If I shou'd, ten to one but I do Mischief—and shall be beaten again: To prevent which I'll wait

within sight for their coming out, so when they are pass'd by, I may with more Security make my Enquiry.</p>

<p>Mademoisel <hi>Joneton</hi> is always so, I think you have the most agreeable manner of speaking—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mart.</speaker>
<p>Fye Madam, how can you do your Reason so much Violence, to commend the most ridiculous Humour that ever Woman took up, it must needs be agreeable to hear Words spun out to half an Hours length.</p>

<p>Well, I must own I like it in her extremely, I think there is a particular Grace in't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mart.</speaker>
<p>Yes, it is something particular truly, sometimes to talk as fast as School-Boys read, and other some so slow, that we forget the Sense of the Argument before she has done speaking.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mad.</speaker>
<p>One wou'd really think my Sister of <hi>Spanish</hi> Production, she is so formal—I see no reason why one may not alter and change the Form and Manner of speaking, according to the Company one keeps, as well as the Mode and Fashion of one Clothes—Now when I converse with my own Sex, I love to indulge my self, and let my Words fall from me with Indolence and Ease, because their Conversation is insipid, and we only prattle away time.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>But there's a vast Pleasure in making them submit to ours, to make so fine a Gentleman as Colonel <hi>Ravelin</hi> obey my Nod, sigh, weep and kneel at ones Frown, then give him Raptures with a Smile. The Colonel! Oh! the most engaging Man alive—When he comes next you shall see him, Sister.</p>

<p>A very odd Expression that—but don't you think our Airs <hi>plus Engageant,</hi> than the Ladies in <hi>England,</hi> Monsieur? How did your Lady dress, to catch your Heart?</p>

<speaker>Mad.</speaker>
<p>That's not your Friend's Opinion, Colonel: He has certainly no Soul.

Seeing that, Madam, away ran I, and call'd this Gentleman to his Assistance; but finding every Door shut, and being very impatient to succour our Friend, as I told you, Madam, we resolv'd to scale the Window; but for want of taking good Notice, we mistook the House, it seems, and so happen'd in here. The Sight of two Men at the Window surpriz'd that Lady, and threw her into Fits—Compassion for the Sex made the Colonel fall foul upon me—And so this created the Bustle, which brought you, Madam; an, an, an, so, so, so, an, an, that's all, Madam—Pray Heav'n this brings us off. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>

<p>What Saint shall I invoke, to save this wretched Pair? I know St. <hi>Anthony</hi> is engag'd on <hi>Don Perriera</hi>'s Side—Let me see, there is some She-Saint that has been a Sinner this way her self; if I cou'd think of her Name, she'd be the fittest Person to do their Business.</p>

<p>'Tis I, fear not: What is the Cause of your Complaint?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<p>Oh! is it you, Senior? Oh, your Country-man's undone. My Master, pretending to go to <hi>St. Ubes</hi> for three Days, conceal'd himself in the House unknown to every body, and has discover'd all. I'm sent this Moment for two Monks from the Convent of <hi>Sante Vincente</hi> to confess the Criminals, and then you know what follows.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Death! Oh Distraction! which, oh, which way, ye Powers, shall I save this perjur'd Man?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<p>Ay, dear Sir, think, if it be possible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>Oh <hi>Charles</hi>! little dost thou think how dear thy unlawful Joys are purchas'd; three Lives for a momentary Bliss: For, in spight of all the Cause that thou hast given me, thou'rt still as dear as Virtue to my Soul, and Life without thee is not to be born. Oh, hear me Heav'n, that knows my chaste Desires, and pity the Distress that tears my Breast; instruct me how to ward this fatal Blow, and save a Man that may return to thee. Ha! methinks I feel the inspiring Thought, and Hope begins to feed the Springs of Life—<hi>Lorenzo,</hi> first bring the Priests to me. If you perform this Business with Success and Secrecy, I'll double twice this Sum.</p>

<p>Not know him, Sir, what a confounded lying old Thief you are, I'll take my Oath I heard you and that bloody-minded <hi>Spaniard,</hi> threaten what you'd do to this Gentleman, if you catch'd him in your House; egad <hi>Charles,</hi> knock him down.</p>

<p>Oh Mr. <hi>Sweep-chimney,</hi> are you here? St. <hi>Anthony</hi> defend me, what Ambuscade am I tumbled into? This was certainly my Wife's Gallant, and has impos'd upon the Priests, as well as me, in Petticoats, and now has trapan'd me here to murder me—Help, Murder, Treason, Murder, help—</p>

<p>Confess your design, and produce your villainous Gang, and they shall have Satisfaction, equal to their Merits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>Gang? By St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> I have no Gang; I came hither to wait on the Lady who belongs to this Appartment, but little thought of meeting with my damnable virtuous Wife's Gallant. I suppose I am decoy'd hither to have my Throat cut, therefore come on both of you, old as I am, I yet can stand a Push.</p>

<p>I wish I had known you in Petticoats.</p>

<p>Ha, this must be <hi>Don Perriera</hi>; but what does he mean by Petticoats? Hold, Sir—What is the Lady's Name of this Appartment?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>I know not, it was to be inform'd of that I came, but I suppose you are the Lady, Sir.</p>
</sp>

<p>Know her! Yes—Delivered by my Wife—</p>

<p>Oh let me fly into thy Arms, my <hi>Isabinda,</hi> my charming Love, thou holdest more Virtues in thy Breast, than thy whole Sex can boast: Can'st thou forgive me, <hi>Isabinda</hi>?</p>

<sp>
<pb n="61" facs="67"/>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>As freely as thou can'st ask it; but hush, we shall be observ'd; let not the Company know this is our first meeting. I was loath to trust the Writings with Strangers, so brought them my self.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Thou are all Goodness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I thought I heard Murder cry out as I enter'd, Senior.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>Why truly, Madam, if you had not come as you did, I was in danger of my Life here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>'Twas only a Mistake, my Dear. I ask your Pardon, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>Pardon, Sir? This is a very odd mistake, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Egad, and so it is; a Pox of my Zeal—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>I hope all Mistakes will be clear'd, Sir, I know you loved my Father, Sir, <hi>Jealous Traffick</hi>; and for his sake, I hope you'll know my Husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>What, my old Friend? Yes faith will I, Sir, I am yours, but I must kiss your Wife. My Dear, why did not you tell me who she was before?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dona Per.</speaker>
<p>A good Reason, because I did not know. <stage>[Aside.]</stage> You saw she forbad me, my Dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Now you are all acquainted, I'll tell you how I came to mistake this Matter: I did not know this was a House of Lodgings, nor that my Friend had remov'd hither, till I found him out by Accident, upon my Honour, Senior—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>The Rogue will stumble out an Excuse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>Honour! Pray, Sir, upon your Honour tell me how you got out of my Room?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<p>For your Soul, no squeaking— <stage>[<hi>Aside to</hi> Mar-plot.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>No, no; never fear me. Egad, what shall I say now? Why, Sir, you must know I am a Chimist, and have found out a Secret that will open and shut all Locks whatever; that help'd me out, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>Say you so, Sir? Pray will you communicate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Not for your whole Estate, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Per.</speaker>
<p>I'll have this Fellow sent out of Town, for by the help of this Secret he'll Cuckold all the Men in <hi>Lisbon.</hi></p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha, what a Lie has he lit of—Colonel, won't the Lady capitulate upon Honourable Terms?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rav.</speaker>
<p>She desires two days Consideration, a great while for a Man to fast, that is almost starv'd already.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mad.</speaker>
<p>Well, Colonel, to shew you I am good-natur'd, I'll put it to Arbitration.</p>

<p>Nay, then Madam, we shall all give it against you.</p>

<p>What's here, a Wedding on foot? Prithee let's have it just now, to reconcile all Differences, and tho' I have not danc'd these forty Years, will take a turn among you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>So! I'll be hang'd if this is not <hi>Mademoisel Flutter</hi> now. Pox of these Matrimonial Intreagues—but Egad we will have Dancing—I'm resolv'd.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>

<p>Faith, Madam, the Cannon of Constancy is a heavy Carriage, and if I shou'd summon my Senses to a Council of War, and make Reason Judge-Advocate, 'tis odds but I raise the Siege.</p>

<p>Well, Colonel, if I surrender Prisoner of War, remember I expect to be generously us'd.</p>

<stage>A Dance.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<l>Come, Colonel, Marriage is the only happy</l>
<l>State, when Virtue is the Guide.</l>
<l>Had but all Women <hi>Isabinda</hi>'s Mind,</l>
<l>So Constant, Prudent, Virtuous, and so kind,</l>
<l>What Joys so great as Wedlock cou'd we find?</l>
<l>No more shou'd we unlawful Love pursue,</l>
<l>But think our Wives for ever young and new,</l>
<l>And learn from them the Art of being true.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<l>In vain we strive by haughty ways to prove</l>
<l>Our chast Affections, and our duteous Love.</l>
<l>To smooth the Husband's rugged Storms of Life,</l>
<l>Is the design and business of a Wife;</l>
<l>Still all his Faults with Patience to behold,</l>
<l>And not for ev'ry Trifle rant, and scold:</l>
<l>Men from Example, more than Precept, learn,</l>
<l>And modest Carriage still has power to Charm.</l>
<l>After my Method, wou'd all Wives but move,</l>
<l>They'd soon regain, and keep their Husbands Love:</l>
<l>Our kind Indulgence wou'd their Vice o'ercome,</l>
<l>And with our Meekness strike their Passions dumb.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<l>THE Play concluded, I'm at last set free,</l>
<l>Resume my self, and now am <hi>Cap-a-pee,</hi></l>
<l>A free-born Nymph of <hi>English</hi> Liberty.</l>
<l>I sweat t' have been a Wife but three bare Hours;</l>
<l>What is't to be one then for Life, ye Powers,</l>
<l>Where Husbands too are ten times worse than ours?</l>
<l>The slightest Trip with them demands our Blood;</l>
<l>But venial Frailties here are better understood.</l>
<l>Your <hi>Don</hi> Cornuted is a Monster there,</l>
<l>But thank our Stars, the Fate's no Wonder here.</l>
<l>The Monster ceases, where the Case is common,</l>
<l>And watch your Eyes out, you must trust the Woman.</l>
<l>In vain her Person with Restraint you load,</l>
<l>When Spite of Walls her willing Mind's abroad.</l>
<l>A blessed Life indeed! where churlish Fear</l>
<l>Attends the Thing your Appetites cou'd spare.</l>
<l>Is there on Earth, a Wretch, a greater Jest,</l>
<l>Than the pale Lover, starv'd for Beauty's Feast,</l>
<l>That begs, in pity of his famish'd Sense, a Taste?</l>
<l>Protest his Appetite shall last for Ages,</l>
<l>And in his hungry Fit, to eat for Life engages.</l>
<l>The Contract seal'd, our Guest falls bravely to,</l>
<l>As if his Appetite from feeding grew:</l>
<l>At last a dull Satiety succeeds,</l>
<l>And the tame Glutton now like Husband feeds.</l>
<l>In baggard Looks, and Matrimonial Mien,</l>
<l>His Soul-sick Pentence is plainly seen;</l>
<l><pb facs="70"/>Incurable his Pain, and laugh'd at in Distress,</l>
<l>He snarling cries, Consume my Happiness.</l>
<l>Oh, tiresome Plenty! O intollerable Bliss!</l>
<l>Oh the lost Joys of freeborn Wretchedness!</l>
<l>Like Dog in Manger, thus he snarles and bites,</l>
<l>And curses what another's Taste delights.</l>
<l>While such Examples 'fore my Eyes I see,</l>
<l>Guard me, ye Powers, from Loss of Liberty.</l>
<l>'Tis strange, you <hi>Britains,</hi> whom no Force can humble,</l>
<l>Shou'd court those Chains, at which you're sure to grumble:</l>
<l>But since, alas! 'tis fatal to the Age,</l>
<l>I'll ev'n maintain my Post upon the Stage;</l>
<l>Which (for at once I'd all Mens Hope prevent)</l>
<l>I'll never leave, tho' tempted with a Settlement.</l>
