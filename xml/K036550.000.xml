<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. WROUGHTON.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>OF all who strive to please the publick car,</l>
<l>Most bold is he who dares attempt it here;</l>
<l>Where four tribunals, a tremendous show,</l>
<l>Plain folk above, and finer folk below,</l>
<l>All sit to try an anxious Author's cause,</l>
<l>Each by its own, and all by different laws.</l>
<l>This beauteous circle, friends to polish'd verse,</l>
<l>Admires soft sentiments in language terse;</l>
<l>While the stern Pit all ornament disdains,</l>
<l>And loves deep pathos, and sublimer strains.</l>
<l>The middle order, free from critick pride,</l>
<l>Take genuine nature for their faithful guide;</l>
<l>At ears and eyes they drink the full delight,</l>
<l>And judge, but as they feel, of wrong and right:</l>
<l>While those above them, honest souls! delight in</l>
<l>Processions, bustle, trumpets, drums, and fighting.</l>
<l>Hard as it is, we think our Play to-night</l>
<l>Has something fit for every appetite.—</l>
<l>For tender souls are tender griefs prepar'd,</l>
<stage>To the Boxes.</stage>
<l>And scenes of direr woe for breasts more hard;</l>
<stage>To the Pit.</stage>
<l>By interesting your passions, we must try</l>
<stage>To the Middle Gallery.</stage>
<l>To bribe the heart while we defraud the eye;</l>
<l>And though no trumpets sound, nor drums will rattle,</l>
<l>You, friends, shall <hi>hear</hi> of a most desperate battle.</l>
<stage>To the Upper Gallery.</stage>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="7"/>
<l>Thus provident for all, we trust you'll own,</l>
<l>Our poet's zeal may for some faults atone:</l>
<l>In this, at least, he hopes you'll all agree,</l>
<l>To shield him from the critick's treachery;</l>
<l>Who, with sly rules upon your judgement stealing,</l>
<l>Would set your pride against your honest feeling;</l>
<l>Would shame the generous drops that swell your eyes,</l>
<l>And teach you your own virtues to despise.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Permit me, ere I go, one short relation,</l>
<l>And just three words by way of application.</l>
<l>A home-spun country 'squire, who took his stand</l>
<l>To see a dex'trous juggler's sleight of hand,</l>
<l>Was thus accosted by an envious wight,</l>
<l>Who sought to hurt the artist from pure spight:</l>
<l>"Sir, for these tricks I'll presently expose them;</l>
<l>"There's nothing in't, I'll show you how he does "them."</l>
<l>How think you the proposal was receiv'd?</l>
<l>"No, (says the 'squire) I pay to be deceiv'd."</l>
<l>Thus Criticks, when poor Authors they condemn,</l>
<l>Mean nothing kind to you, but spleen to them:</l>
<l>Then still mistrust, whate'er he may profess,</l>
<l>The friend who strives to make your pleasure less.</l>

<stage>Count, <hi>as he enters, speaking to an Officer</hi>; Fabian <hi>following.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>—NOT to be found! is this your faithful service?</l>
<l>How could she pass unseen? By hell, 'tis false;</l>
<l>Thou hast betray'd me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>Noble sir! my duty—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Your fraud, your negligence,—away, reply not.</l>
<l>Find her within this hour; else, by my life,</l>

<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Officer.</stage>
<l>Fabian, stay!</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="10"/>Misfortunes fall so thick upon my head,</l>
<l>They will not give me time to think, to breathe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>Heaven knows I wish your peace; but am to learn,</l>
<l>What grief more fresh than my young lord's decease</l>
<l>(A sorrow but of three days pass'd) can move you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>O bitter memory! gone, gone for ever!</l>
<l>The pillar of my house, my only son!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>'Twas terrible indeed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Ay, was it not?</l>
<l>And then the manner of it; think on that:</l>
<l>Disease, that robb'd me of two infant sons,</l>
<l>Approaching slow, bade me prepare to lose them;</l>
<l>I saw my lilies drooping; and, accustom'd</l>
<l>To see them dying, bore to see them dead:</l>
<l>But O my Edmund!—Thou remember'st, Fabian,</l>
<l>How blithe he went to seek the forest's sport.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>Would I could not remember!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>That curs'd Barb</l>
<l>(My fatal gift) that dash'd him down the cliff,</l>
<l>Seem'd proud or his gay burden.—Breathless, mangled,</l>
<l>They bore him back to me. Fond man! I hoped</l>
<l>This day his happy match with Isabel</l>
<l>Had made our line perpetual; and, this day,</l>
<l>The unfruitful grave receives him. Yes, 'tis fate;</l>
<l>That dreadful denunciation 'gainst my house</l>
<l>No prudence can avert, nor prayers can soften.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="11"/>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>Think not on that; some visionary's dream.</l>
<l>What house, what family could e'er know peace,</l>
<l>If each enthusiast's ravings were believ'd,</l>
<l>And frenzy deem'd an insight of the future?</l>
<l>But may I dare to ask, is it of moment</l>
<l>To stir your anger thus, that Isabel</l>
<l>Has left the castle?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Of the deepest moment;</l>
<l>My best hope hangs on her; some future time,</l>
<l>I may instruct thee why.—These cares unhinge me.</l>
<l>Just now, a herald from her angry father</l>
<l>Left me this dire election,—to resign</l>
<l>My titles, and this ample signory,</l>
<l>(Worthy a monarch's envy,) or to meet him,</l>
<l>And try my right by arms. But pr'ythee tell,</l>
<l>(Nor let a fear to wound thy master's pride</l>
<l>Restrain thy licens'd speech,) hast thou e'er heard</l>
<l>My father Raymond—cast not down thine eye—</l>
<l>By any indirect or bloody means</l>
<l>Procur'd that instrument, Alphonso's will,</l>
<l>That made him heir to Narbonne?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>My best lord,</l>
<l>At all times would I fain with-hold from you</l>
<l>Intelligence unwelcome, but most now.</l>
<l>At seasons such as this, a friendly tongue</l>
<l>Should utter words like balm; but what you ask—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>—I ask to be inform'd of. Hast thou known me</l>
<l>From childhood up to man, and canst thou fear</l>
<l>I am so weak of soul, like a thin reed,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="12"/>To bend and stagger at each puny blast?</l>
<l>No; when the tempest rages round my head,</l>
<l>I give my branches wider to the air,</l>
<l>And strike my root more deeply.—To thy tale:</l>
<l>Away with palliatives and compliment;—</l>
<l>Speak plainly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>Plainly then, my lord, I have heard</l>
<l>What, for the little breath I have to draw,</l>
<l>I would not, to the black extent of rumour,</l>
<l>Give credit to.—But you command me speak—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Thy pauses torture me.—Can I hear worse</l>
<l>Than this black scroll contains; this challenge here</l>
<l>From Isabella's father, haughty Godfrey?</l>
<l>In broad and unambiguous words he tells me</l>
<l>My father was a murderer, and forg'd</l>
<l>Alphonso's testament.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>From Palestine</l>
<l>That tale crept hither; where, foul slander says,</l>
<l>The good Alphonso, not, as we believe,</l>
<l>Died of a fever, but a venom'd draught,</l>
<l>Your father, his companion of the cross,</l>
<l>Did with his own hand mingle; his hand too</l>
<l>(Assisted by some cunning practisers)</l>
<l>Model'd that deed, which, barring Godfrey's right,</l>
<l>And other claims from kindred, nam'd Count Raymond</l>
<l>Lord of these fair possessions.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Ha! I have it;</l>
<l>'Tis Godfrey's calumny; he has coin'd this lie;</l>
<l>And his late visit to the holy land,</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="13"/>No doubt, has furnish'd likelihood of proof,</l>
<l>To give his fiction colour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>Sure 'tis so.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>He too has forg'd this idle prophecy,</l>
<l>(To shake me with false terrors) this prediction,</l>
<l>Which but to think of used to freeze my veins;</l>
<l>"That no descendant from my father's loins</l>
<l>"Should live to see a grandson, nor heaven's wrath</l>
<l>"Cease to afflict us, till Alphonso's heir</l>
<l>"Succeeded to his just inheritance."</l>
<l>Hence Superstition mines my tottering state,</l>
<l>Loosens my vassals' faith, and turns their tears,</l>
<l>Which else would fall for my calamities,</l>
<l>To gloomy pause, and gaping reverence:</l>
<l>While all my woes, to their perverted sense,</l>
<l>Seem but the marvellous accomplishment</l>
<l>Of revelation, out of nature's course.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>Reason must so interpret. Good my lord,</l>
<l>What answer was return'd to Godfrey's challenge?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Defiance.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>Heaven defend you!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Heaven defend me!</l>
<l>I hope it will; and this right arm to boot.</l>
<l>But, hark! I hear a noise.—Perhaps my people</l>
<l>Have found the fugitive.—Haste; bid them enter.</l>

<head>SCENE II.</head>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT,</speaker>
<stage>alone.</stage>
<l>She eyed me with abhorrence; at the sound</l>
<l>Of love, of marriage, sled indignant from me.</l>
<l>Yet I must win her: should she meet my wish,</l>
<l>Godfrey would prop the right he strives to shake,</l>
<l>Securing thus to his fair daughter's issue</l>
<l>All that now hangs on the sword's doubtful point.</l>
<l>Her beauty too, each soft attractive grace,</l>
<l>I saw with jealous pleasure, even when destin'd</l>
<l>To my son's arms. His death removes one bar;</l>
<l>And, fortune to my double aim conspiring,</l>
<l>I'll silence saucy conscience.</l>

<l>Now, what tidings?</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>We have search'd in vain</l>
<l>The castle round; left not an aile or vault</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Damnation!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>Near the cloister,</l>
<l>From whence, by the flat door's descent, a passage</l>
<l>Beneath the ground leads onward to the convent,</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="15"/>We heard the echo of a falling weight,</l>
<l>And sought it by the sound.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Well, and what then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>The unsettled dust left us no room to doubt</l>
<l>The door had just been rais'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>She has escap'd,</l>
<l>And by confed'racy: to force that bar,</l>
<l>Without more aid, had baffled twice her strength.</l>
<l>Go on.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>We enter'd; with resistance bold,</l>
<l>This peasant push'd us backward from the spot.</l>
<l>My arm was rais'd to smite him, but respect</l>
<l>For something in his aspect check'd the blow.</l>
<l>He, chiding, parlying by turns, gave time</l>
<l>For whosoever had descended there</l>
<l>(The lady doubtless) to elude our search:</l>
<l>The rest himself will tell.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<stage>To the Peasant.</stage>
<l>Ha! what art thou?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>It seems thy prisoner: disengage me first</l>
<l>From their rude gripe, and I may tell thee more.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Unhand him. I should know thee; I have seen</l>
<l>Features like thine. Answer me, wert thou found</l>
<l>As these men say?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>I was.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="16"/>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>And what thy purpose?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>Chance brought me there.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>And did chance lead thee too</l>
<l>To aid a fugitive?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>They saw not that.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>They saw it not! How! could her delicate hands,</l>
<l>Weak, soft, and yielding to the gentlest touch,</l>
<l>Sustain that pond'rous mass? No; those tough arms,</l>
<l>Thy force, assisted; else, thou young dissembler—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>She had been seiz'd, and by compulsion brought</l>
<l>Where I stand now.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Thou dost avow it then,</l>
<l>Boast it even to my face, audacious stripling!</l>
<l>Such insolence and these coarse rustick weeds</l>
<l>Are contradictions. Answer me, who art thou?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>Less than I should be; more than what I seem.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Hence with this saucy ambiguity.</l>
<l>What is thy name, thy country? That mean habit</l>
<l>(Which should teach humbleness) speaks thy condition.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>My name is Theodore, my country France;</l>
<l>My habit little suited to my mind,</l>
<l>Less to my birth; yet sit for my condition.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="17"/>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>O, thou art then some young adventurer,</l>
<l>Some roving knight, a hero in disguise,</l>
<l>Who, scorning forms of vulgar ceremony,</l>
<l>No leave obtain'd, waiting no invitation,</l>
<l>Enters our castles, wanders o'er our halls,</l>
<l>To succour dames distress'd, or pilfer gold.</l>
<l>Where are your train, your pages, and your squires?</l>
<l>Perhaps but poorly lodg'd! I am to blame;</l>
<l>But must excuse my scanted courtesy,</l>
<l>By ignorance of your high character.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>There is a source of reverence for thee here,</l>
<l>Forbids me, though provok'd, retort thy taunts.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>If I endure this more, I shall grow vile</l>
<l>Even to my hinds—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>Hold, let me stop thy wrath.</l>
<l>I see thy quivering lip, thy firy eye,</l>
<l>Forerun a storm of passion. To prevent thee</l>
<l>From terms too harsh, perhaps, for thee to offer,</l>
<l>Or me to hear (poor as I seem) with honour,</l>
<l>I will cut short thy interrogatories,</l>
<l>And on this theme give thee the full extent</l>
<l>Of all I know, or thou canst wish to learn.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>Do it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>Without a view to thwart thy purpose</l>
<l>(Be what it might), was I within thy walls.</l>
<l>In a dim passage of the castle-ailes</l>
<l>Musing alone, I heard a hasty tread,</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="18"/>And breath drawn short, like one in fear of peril.</l>
<l>A lady enter'd, (fair she seem'd, and young,)</l>
<l>Guiding her timorous footsteps by a lamp:</l>
<l>"The lord, the tyrant of this place (she cried)</l>
<l>"For a detested purpose follows me;</l>
<l>"Aid me▪ good youth:" then, pointing to the ground,</l>
<l>"That door (she added) leads to sanctuary."</l>
<l>I seiz'd an iron hold, and, while I tugg'd</l>
<l>To heave the unwilling weight, I learn'd her title.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>The lady Isabel?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>The same. A gleam,</l>
<l>Shot from their torches who pursued her track,</l>
<l>Prevented more; she hasten'd to the cave,</l>
<l>And vanish'd from my sight.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<l>And did no awe,</l>
<l>No fear of him she call'd this castle's lord,</l>
<l>Its tyrant, chill thee?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEASANT.</speaker>
<l>Awe nor fear I know not,</l>
<l>And trust shall never; for I know not guilt.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>

<l>The picture of Alphonso in the chamber:</l>

<l>Call it not so; I have kind counsel for him;</l>
<l>Which, if he follow it, may serve to speed</l>
<l>The hour of his deliverance, and appease</l>
<l>The unjustly-anger'd Count.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Pray be content;</l>
<l>I dare not do it. Have this castle's walls</l>

<l>The temper of the Count? Serv'd and obey'd,</l>
<l>There lives not one more gracious, liberal;</l>

<l>I'd rather play with serpents. But fair Jaqueline,</l>
<l><pb n="19" facs="27"/>Setting aside the comeliness and grace</l>
<l>Of this young rustick, which I own are rare,</l>
<l>And baits to catch all women, pr'ythee tell,</l>
<l>Why are you thus solicitous to see him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JAQUELINE.</speaker>
<l>In me 'twere base to be indifferent:</l>
<l>He was my life's preserver, nay preserv'd</l>
<l>A life more precious: yes, my dear young mistress!</l>
<l>But for his aid, the eternal sleep of death</l>
<l>Had closed the sweetest eyes that ever beam'd.</l>
<l>Aloof and frighted stood her coward train,</l>
<l>And saw a furious band of desperate slaves,</l>
<l>Inur'd to blood and rapine, bear her off.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>What! when the gang of outlaw'd Thiery</l>
<l>Rush'd on her chariot near the wood of Zart,</l>
<l>Was he the unknown youth who succour'd her?</l>
<l>All good betide him for it!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JAQUELINE.</speaker>
<l>Yes, 'twas he.</l>
<l>From one tame wretch he snatch'd a half-drawn sword,</l>
<l>And dealt swift vengeance on the ruffian crew.</l>
<l>Two at his seet stretch'd dead, the rest amaz'd</l>
<l>Fled, muttering curses, while he bore her back,</l>
<l>Unhurt but by her fears.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>He should be worship'd,</l>
<l>Have statues rais'd to him; for, by my life,</l>
<l>I think there does not breathe another like her.</l>
<l>It makes me young to see her lovely eyes:</l>
<l>Such charity! such sweet benevolence!</l>
<l>So fair, and yet so humble! prais'd for ever,</l>

<l>(And sure 'twas unintended) could provoke</l>
<l>The rigorous Count thus to imprison him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FABIAN.</speaker>
<l>My Lord was ever proud and cholerick;</l>
<l>The youth, perhaps unused to menaces,</l>
<l>Brook'd them but ill, and darted frown for frown;</l>
<l>This stirr'd the Count to fury. But fear nothing;</l>
<l>All will be well; I'll wait the meetest season,</l>
<l>And be his advocate.</l>

<l>I sent thee to his prison. Quickly tell me,</l>
<l>What says he, does he know my sorrow for him?</l>
<l>Does he confound me with the unfeeling crew,</l>
<l>Who act my father's bidding? Can his love</l>

<l><pb n="21" facs="29"/>And fearful to awake his master's wrath,</l>
<l>Though much unwilling, bars me from his presence.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ADELAIDE.</speaker>
<l>Unkind old man! I would myself entreat him,</l>
<l>But fear my earnest look, these starting tears,</l>
<l>Might to the experience of his prying age</l>
<l>Reveal a secret, which in vain I strive</l>
<l>To hide from my own breast.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JAQUELINE.</speaker>
<l>Alas, dear lady,</l>
<l>Did not your tongue reveal it, your chang'd mien,</l>
<l>Once lighter than the airy woodnymph's shade,</l>
<l>Now turn'd to pensive thought, and melancholy,—</l>
<l>Involuntary sighs,—your cheek, unlike</l>
<l>Its wonted bloom, as is the red-vein'd rose</l>
<l>To the dim sweetness of the violet,—</l>
<l>These had too soon betray'd you. But take heed;</l>
<l>The colour of our fate too oft is ting'd</l>
<l>Mournful, or bright, but from our first affections.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADELAIDE.</speaker>
<l>Foul disproportion draws down shame on love,</l>
<l>But where's the crime in fair equality?</l>
<l>Mean birth presumes a mind uncultivate,</l>
<l>Left to the coarseness of its native soil,</l>
<l>To grow like weeds, and die, like them, neglected;</l>
<l>But he was born my equal; lineag'd high,</l>
<l>And titled as our great ones: then his soul—</l>
<l>The blood of Valois, circling in his veins,</l>
<l>Could add no jot to its true royalty.</l>

<speaker>ADELAIDE.</speaker>
<l>I'll not mistrust him.</l>
<l>Since the bless'd hour that brought him first to save me,</l>
<l>How often have I listen'd to the tale!</l>
<l>It varies not, for truth 's invariable.</l>
<l>He needs no vouchers. Gallant, generous youth!</l>
<l>Thy sport, Misfortune, from his infant years!—</l>
<l>Wilt thou pursue him still?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JAQUELINE.</speaker>
<l>Indeed 'tis hard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADELAIDE.</speaker>
<l>But oh the pang, that these ungrateful walls</l>
<l>Should be his prison! Here if I were aught,</l>
<l>His presence should have made it festival;</l>
<l>These gates untouch'd had leap'd to give him entrance,</l>
<l>And songs of joy made glad the way before him.</l>
<l>Instead of this, think what has been his welcome!</l>
<l>Drag'd by rude hands before a furious judge,</l>
<l>Insulted, menac'd, like the vilest slave,</l>
<l>And doom'd unhear'd to ignominious bondage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JAQUELINE.</speaker>
<l>Your father knew not of his service to you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADELAIDE.</speaker>
<l>No, his indignant soul disdain'd to tell it.</l>
<l>Great spirits, conscious of their inborn worth,</l>
<l>Scorn by demand to force the praise they merit;</l>
<l>They feel a flame beyond their brightest deeds,</l>
<l>And leave the weak to note them, and to wonder.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JAQUELINE.</speaker>
<l>Suppress these strong emotions. The Count's eye</l>
<l>Is quick to find offence. Should he suspect</l>
<l>This unpermitted passion, 'twould draw down</l>
<l><pb n="23" facs="31"/>More speedy vengeance on the helpless youth,</l>
<l>Turning your fatal fondness to his ruin.</l>

<speaker>ADELAIDE.</speaker>
<l>Indeed I want thy counsel. Yet, oh leave me!</l>
<l>Find if my gold, my gems, can ransom him.</l>
<l>Had I the world, it should be his as freely.</l>
<l>I would go kirtled like a village-maid,</l>
<l>Plain all my life, in nature's simplest dress,</l>
<l>Rather than deck'd with proud superfluous wealth,</l>
<l>While one more worthy, wanting life's poor means,</l>
<l>Upbraids the insulting splendour of abundance.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>JAQUELINE.</speaker>
<l>Trust to my care. The Countess comes to seek you;</l>

<l>To keep each character distinctly true;</l>
<l>The subtle plot with happy skill combine,</l>
<l>And chain attention to the nervous line;</l>
<l>With weighty, clashing interests, to perplex,</l>
<l>Through five—long acts,—each person—of each sex;</l>
<l>And then at last, by dagger or by bowl,</l>
<l>With poignant grief to harrow up the soul.—</l>
<l>All this achiev'd, the bard at ease carouses,</l>
<l>And dreams of laurels and o'erflowing houses.</l>
<l>Alas, poor man! his work is done but half;—</l>

<l>Our Bard "of this had ta'en too little care,"</l>
<l>And by a friend besought me to appear.</l>
<l>"Madam," he said, "so oft you have grac'd the "scene,</l>
<l>"An injur'd princess, or a weeping queen;</l>
<l>"So oft been used to die, in anguish bitter,</l>
<l>"And then start up—to make the audience titter,</l>
<l><pb facs="90"/>"That, doubtless, you know best what is in vogue,</l>
<l>"And can yourself invent an epilogue:</l>
<l>"You can supply our authour's tardy quill,</l>
<l>"And gild the surface of his tragick pill;</l>
<l>"Your ready wit a recipe can bring,</l>
<l>"For this capricious, serio-comick thing."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>A <hi>Recipe</hi> for epilogues!—"Why not?</l>
<l>"Have you each vaunting Chronicle forgot?</l>
<l>"Have we not recipes each day, each hour,</l>
<l>"To give to mortal man immortal power?</l>
<l>"To give the ungraceful, timid speaker, breath,</l>
<l>"And save his quivering eloquence from death <note n="†" place="foot">A quack medicine has been long recommended, in a printed advertisement, for its efficacy in composing the agitated nerves of those who speak in publick.</note>?</l>
<l>"Have we not now a geometrick school,</l>
<l>"To teach the cross-leg'd youth—to snip by rule? <note n="‡" place="foot">A tailor has lately informed the publick in most of the newspapers, that he sits his customers by <hi>geometrick rules.</hi></note></l>
<l>"When arts like these each moment meet your eyes,</l>
<l>"Why should receipts for Epilogues surprise?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Well, Sir, I'll try—I first advance with simper,</l>
<l>(Forgotten quite my tragick state and whimper)—</l>
<l>"Ladies, to-night my fate was surely hard:</l>
<l>"What could possess our inconsiderate bard,</l>
<l>"A wife to banish—that his miss might wed,</l>
<l>"When <hi>modern</hi> priests allow them both one bed."</l>
<l>Thus I'll begin—But it will never do,</l>
<l>Unless some recent anecdotes ensue.—</l>
<l>Has no frail dame been caught behind a screen?</l>
<l>No panting virgin flown to Gretna Green?—</l>
<l>Have we no news of Digby—or the Dutch?—</l>
<l>At some rich Nabob can't I have a touch?</l>
<l>Or the fam'd quack, who, but for duns terrestrial,</l>
<l>Had gain'd the Indies by his <hi>bed celestial</hi> <note n="§" place="foot">"If he were not prevented by unprecedented cruelty, he would in a few years have become one of his majesty's richest and most respectable subjects." Dr. Graham's <hi>Advertisement from the Temple of Hymen.</hi></note>?</l>
<l><pb facs="91"/>"Bravo, Miss Younge; the thought my friend will bless;</l>
<l>"This modish medley must ensure success."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Won by this smooth-tongued flatterer, I've dar'd</l>
<l>To do what ev'n our fluent anthour fear'd.</l>
<l>If I succeed to-night, the trade I'll follow,</l>
<l>And dedicate my leisure to <hi>Apollo</hi>:</l>
<l>Before my house a board shall straight be hung,</l>
<l>With—<hi>Epilogues made here by Dr. Younge</hi>;</l>
<l>Nor will I, like my breth'ren, take a fee;—</l>
<l>Your hands and smiles are wealth enough for me.</l>

<div1 type="epilogue">
<p>THE following EPILOGUE, which was spoken on the first two nights of the exhibition of this tragedy, was obligingly written by R. J. GOODENOUGH, <abbr>Esq</abbr> who did not know that an Epilogue had been prepared for it by Mr. Malone, at the Author's request.</p>
<lg>
<l>'TIS an old maxim with dramatick sages,</l>
<l>To draw their tragick lore from distant ages.</l>
<l>The ruder manners, and impetuous vein,</l>
<l>Which no trim rules of <hi>etiquette</hi> restrain;</l>
<l>The gen'rous plainness of th' unpractis'd heart,</l>
<l>Nature's free powers yet unsubdued by art;</l>
<l>The rough simplicity,—the darksome time,—</l>
<l>Improve the <hi>pathos,</hi>—heighten the sublime:</l>
<l>While all the Poet's deepest skill might fail,</l>
<l>If us'd to decorate some modern tale.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>In me you've seen a wife—who, though abhorr'd,</l>
<l>Abandon'd, threaten'd by her tyrant Lord,</l>
<l><pb facs="92"/>Did patient long her firm affection prove,</l>
<l>'Midst the keen tortures of insulted love.</l>
<l>You've seen a maiden—fair, and nobly born,</l>
<l>Attach'd to merit, wretched and forlorn;</l>
<l>And then, her lover, in a mean disguise,</l>
<l>In native worth above all titles rise.</l>
<l>A priest—with zeal and holy ardour fraught,</l>
<l>Practise the lessons which his preaching taught.</l>
<l>—But while at scenes like these your bosoms glow,</l>
<l>You'll recollect, they happen'd—long ago.</l>
<l>In <hi>our</hi> gay times, a wife forsaken, scorn'd,</l>
<l>Had ne'er in doleful guise her fortune mourn'd;</l>
<l>But with frail schemes; in fashionable course,</l>
<l>Had been the <hi>first</hi> to furnish a divorce.</l>
<l>The maiden had her peasant swain despis'd,</l>
<l>And stars, and lace, and liv'ries, more had priz'd.</l>
<l>Nor could, in this, perhaps, her choice be blam'd;</l>
<l>For say, what lover now had other merit claim'd?</l>
<l>As for our priests—in rev'rence let them rest;—</l>
<l>On modern saints—the least that's said, is best.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Of manners, then, so different in their kind,</l>
<l>The old are rude—the new are too refin'd.</l>
<l>That author well deserves our warmest praise,</l>
<l>Who those examples which we need displays.</l>
<l>Who, 'midst the placid murmurings of <hi>Ton,</hi></l>
<l>Rolls the rough tide of Gothick force along;</l>
<l>And when true worth seems withering at the root,</l>
<l>Turns the rich soil whence towering virtues shoot.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Ne'er can the Muse be more our nature's friend,</l>
<l>Than when she strives its wide extremes to blend;</l>
<l>Bids simple truth with polish'd fashion join,</l>
<l>And ancient strength with modern grace combine.</l>
