<p>THE EARL of ESSEX. A TRAGEDY. As it is ACTED at the THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.</p>

<head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE <hi>PHILIP,</hi> Earl of CHESTERFIELD, &amp;c. Kight of the most Noble Order of the Garter.</head>
<opener><salute>MY LORD,</salute></opener>
<p>THAT You may be induced to read this Dedication through, I shall begin by assuring You, that I do not intend to pay You one Compliment. To praise You is unnecessary on all hands; Your Lordship, it is offensive, and for the Public, they do not want to be informed of Your Character: It lives, at present, in the Mouths of all Men, and Posterity will find in the History of EUROPE.</p>
<p>My Design, My LORD, is to express my own Gratitude, not to delineate Your Merit. 'Twas Your LORDSHIP first took Notice of me, in my original Obscurity, whence You brought me into Life, and have since continued to
<pb n="iv" facs="3"/>encourage me by Your Countenance and Favour; and I cannot help confessing, that I have a kind of honest Pride in having it known, that Your LORDSHIP thought me worthy to be taken under Your Protection.</p>
<p>These, my LORD, are the general Obligations that I owe You, of which I have ever wished to raise some Monument, that may remain as long as my Name shall be remembered; but I have more particular Reasons for presenting You with this Tragedy, as it was Your LORDSHIP first pointed out to me the Subject, and, when it was finished, gave me the first Assurance of its Success, by Your Approbation. I could not therefore avoid taking Advantage of this Opportunity, to acknowledge, publickly, all these Favours; and to assure You, that I am</p>
<closer><signed>Your Lordship's most Obliged, Most Obedient, and Very Humble Servant,

<head><hi>To Mr.</hi> HENRY JONES, <hi>on his Tragedy of the</hi> Earl of ESSEX.</head>
<lg>
<l>AS ancient Heroes are renown'd in Song,</l>
<l>For rescuing Virtue from th'Oppressor's Wrong,</l>
<l>So shall thy Fame, who snatch'd this well-wrought Tale,</l>
<l>From Dulness' gloomy Pow'r, o'er Time prevail.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Long had these Scenes, wound up with dext'rous Art,</l>
<l>In spight of Reason, gain'd upon the Heart;</l>
<l>Thaw'd ev'ry frozen Fountain of the Eye,</l>
<l>We wept, 'till even Sorrow's self was dry;</l>
<l>Yet Judgment scorn'd what Passion had approv'd,</l>
<l>And the Head wonder'd, how the Heart was mov'd,</l>
<l>But, with a Fate revers'd, thy Work shall boast,</l>
<l>That soundest Judgments shall admire it most,</l>
<l>Cloath'd in the easy Grandeur of thy Lines,</l>
<l>The Story brightens, as the Diction shines.</l>
<l>Renew'd with Vigour as in Age 'tis grown,</l>
<l>The wond'ring Scene sees Beauties not it's own.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus, worn with Years, in <hi>Afric</hi>'s sultry Vales,</l>
<l>The crested Snake shifts off his tarnish'd Scales;</l>
<l>Assumes fresh Beauties, brighter than the old,</l>
<l>Of changing Colours, intermix'd with Gold:</l>
<l>Reburnish'd, basks beneath the scorching Ray,</l>
<l>Shines with new Glories in the Face of Day,</l>
<l>Darts fiercer Lightning from his brandish'd Tongue,</l>
<l>Rolls more sublime, and seems, at least, more young.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>No more shall Noise, and wild, bombastic Rage</l>
<l>Usurp th' applauding Thunder of the Stage;</l>
<l>Fustian no more shall pass for true Sublime,</l>
<l>Nor Nonsense musically float in Rhime;</l>
<l>Nor, in a worse Extreme, shall creeping Prose,</l>
<l>For Nature and Simplicity, impose:</l>
<l><pb n="vi" facs="5"/>
By thee reform'd, each vicious Taste shall fail,</l>
<l>And Critic Justice hold aloft her Scale.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Whence beams this dazling Lustre on thy Mind?</l>
<l>Whence this vast Fund of Knowledge in Mankind,</l>
<l>Unletter'd Genius? Whence hast thou been taught</l>
<l>This Dignity of Stile, this Majesty of Thought,</l>
<l>This rapid Fire, by cool Correctness rul'd,</l>
<l>And ev'ry learned Elegance, unschool'd?</l>
<l>Say, hath great <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s transmigrated Shade</l>
<l>Inform'd thy Mass, or lent thee friendly Aid?</l>
<l>To him, bless'd Bard! untaught, 'twas also giv'n,</l>
<l>T' ascend, on native Wings, Invention's brightest Heaven,
<note n="*" place="foot">Alluding to the Prologue to <hi>Henry</hi> V.</note></l>
<l>Assuming <hi>Phoebus'</hi> Port; and, in his Train,</l>
<l>The Muses all, like Handmaids, not in vain,</l>
<l>Crouch for Employment.—</l>
<l>The Passions too, subservient to his Will,</l>
<l>Attentive wait on his superior Skill;</l>
<l>At the Command of his inchanting Art,</l>
<l>Unlock the bursting Flood-gates of the Heart,</l>
<l>And in the rapid, headlong Stream, bear down</l>
<l>The vanquish'd Soul, and make it all his own.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Happy, the Clime, distinguish'd be the Age,</l>
<l>When Genius shoots spontaneous for the Stage;</l>
<l>Not too luxuriant, nor too trimly neat,</l>
<l>But, in loose Wildness, negligently great.</l>
<l>O may the gen'rous Plants, so wond'rous rare,</l>
<l>Ne'er want the tender Hand of fost'ring care;</l>
<l>But, like <hi>Apollo</hi>'s fav'rite Tree, be seen,</l>
<l>For ever flourishing, for ever green.</l>

<head>PROLOGUE</head>

<sp>
<lg>
<l>OUR desp'rate Bard a bold Excursion tries,</l>
<l>Tho' Danger damp'd his Wing, he dar'd to rise;</l>
<l>From Hope, high rais'd, all glorious Actions spring;</l>
<l>'Tis hence that Heroes conquer, Poets sing.</l>
<l>Even he may feel the soul-exalting Fire,</l>
<l>Fame prompts the humblest Bosom to aspire.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Without a Guide this rash Attempt he made,</l>
<l>Without a Clue from Art, or Learning's Aid.</l>
<l>He takes a Theme where tend'rest Passions glow,</l>
<l>A Theme, your Grandsires felt with pleasing Woe,</l>
<l><hi>ESSEX'</hi> sad Tale he strives to cloath anew,</l>
<l>And hopes to place it in a stronger View.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Poets, like Painters, may, by equal Law,</l>
<l>The labour'd Piece from different Masters draw,</l>
<l>Perhaps improve the Plan, add Fire and Grace,</l>
<l>And strike th' impassion'd Soul through all the Face.</l>
<l>How far our Author has secur'd a Claim</l>
<l>To this exalted Palm, this wish'd-for Fame,</l>
<l>Your generous Sentiments will soon declare:</l>
<l>Humanity is ever prone to spare.</l>
<l>'Twere Baseness then your Candour to distrust;</l>
<l>A <hi>BRITISH</hi> Audience will, at least, be just.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>A flattering Truth he fearful must confess,</l>
<l>His sanguine Friends made Promise of Success;</l>
<l>But that, he fears, their ardent Wishes wrought,</l>
<l>Since partial Favour seldom sees a Fault.</l>
<l>Then bear, like patient Friends, this first Essay,</l>
<l>His next shall thank you in a nobler Way.</l>

<l>THE Bill, at length, has pass'd opposing Numbers,</l>

<l>And headlong Faction urg'd its Force within.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RALEIGH.</speaker>
<l>It has, my Lord.—The wish'd-for Day is come,</l>
<l>When this proud Idol of the People's Hearts</l>
<l>Shall now no more be worshipp'd.—<hi>Essex</hi> falls.</l>
<l>My Lord, the Minute's near that shall unravel</l>
<l>The mystic Schemes of this aspiring Man.</l>
<l>Now Fortune, with officious Hand, invites us</l>
<l>To her, and opens wide the Gates of Greatness,</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="9"/>
The Way to Power. My Heart exults; I see,</l>
<l>I see, my Lord, our utmost Wish accomplish'd!</l>
<l>I see great <hi>Cecil</hi> shine without a Rival,</l>
<l>And <hi>England</hi> bless him as her Guardian Saint.</l>
<l>Such potent Instruments I have prepar'd</l>
<l>As shall, with speed, o'erturn this hated Man,</l>
<l>And dash him down, by Proof invincible.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>His Day of Glory now is set in Night,</l>
<l>And all my anxious Hopes, at last, are crown'd.</l>
<l>Those Proofs against him, <hi>Raleigh</hi>—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RALEIGH.</speaker>
<l>All arriv'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>Arriv'd! how? when?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RALEIGH.</speaker>
<l>This very Hour, my Lord:</l>
<l>Nay more, a Person comes, of high Distinction,</l>
<l>To prove some secret Treaties made by <hi>Essex,</hi></l>
<l>With <hi>Scotland</hi>'s Monarch, and the proud <hi>Tyrone.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>How say'st? to prove 'em?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RALEIGH.</speaker>
<l>Ay, my Lord, and back'd</l>
<l>With Circumstances of a stronger Nature.</l>
<l>It now appears his Secretary <hi>Cuff,</hi></l>
<l>With <hi>Plunt</hi> and <hi>Lee</hi> were deep concern'd in this</l>
<l>Destructive Scheme, contriv'd to raise this Lord,</l>
<l>And ruin <hi>Cecil,</hi> O it is a subtil,</l>
<l>A deep-laid Mischief, by the Earl contriv'd,</l>
<l>In Hour malignant, to o'erturn the State,</l>
<l>And (Horror to conceive!) dethrone the Queen.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>These gladsome Tidings fly beyond my Hopes!</l>
<l>The Queen will listen now, will now believe,</l>
<l>And trust the Counsel of her faithful <hi>Burleigh.</hi></l>
<l>Let this most lucky Circumstance be kept</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="10"/>
A Secret still from public Observation.—</l>
<l>Dispose 'em well, till kind Occasion call</l>
<l>Their Office forth, lest prying Craft mean while</l>
<l>May tamper with their Thoughts, and change their Minds:</l>
<l>Let them, like Batteries conceal'd, appear</l>
<l>At once, both to surprize and to destroy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RALEIGH.</speaker>
<l>This sudden Shock, my Lord, this weighty Stroke</l>
<l>Must press him headlong down to deep Destruction:</l>
<l>Indignant Fate marks out this dreaded Man,</l>
<l>And Fortune now has left him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>Thank the Changeling!</l>
<l>His servile Faction soon will stand aghast,</l>
<l>And sink, at distance, from his threat'ning Fall.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RALEIGH.</speaker>
<l>His head strong Friend, the bold <hi>Southampton</hi> too,</l>
<l>Now finds his rash Endeavours all defeated;</l>
<l>And storms at thee and the impeaching Commons.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>Let him rave on, and rage. — The Lion in</l>
<l>The Toils entangled, wastes his Strength, and roars</l>
<l>In vain; his Efforts but amuse me now.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RALEIGH.</speaker>
<l>What Triumphs in my Soul shall reign, to see</l>
<l>This sanguine and o'erbearing Man brought down</l>
<l>Beneath my Envy; nay, below my Scorn.</l>
<l>How young Ambition swells my rising Hopes!</l>
<l>Tis Heaven, O <hi>Cecil,</hi> calls, thro' <hi>England</hi>'s Voice,</l>

<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>What may the Purport of her Bus'ness be!</l>
<l>Her tender Wishes are to <hi>Essex</hi> ty'd</l>
<l>In Love's soft Fetters, and endearing Bands:</l>
<l>For him, each melting Thought awakes Desire,</l>
<l>And all her Soul is lavish'd on that Lord.—</l>
<l>This unexpected Visit much surprizes me!</l>
<l>What can it mean? She would not come to pry</l>
<l>And pick out Tales for <hi>Essex</hi>'s Ear!—Why let her;</l>
<l>I'm arm'd secure against her Arts and Cunning.</l>
<l>Besides, her Errand comes too late; for now</l>
<l>Her Minion's doom'd to fall. — Conduct her in:</l>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Gent.</stage>
<l>And you, my <hi>Raleigh,</hi> watch <hi>Southampton</hi>'s Steps;</l>

<l>His headlong Councils, and adopts his Schemes;</l>
<l>His daring Heart, and bold, ungovern'd Tongue,</l>
<l>Are both enlisted in the rash Designs</l>
<l>Of this proud Lord, nor knows a Will but his.</l>
<l>A Limb, so fix'd, must with the Body fall.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>NOTTINGHAM.</speaker>
<l>Thrice hail to rescu'd <hi>England</hi>'s guiding Genius'</l>
<l>His Country's Guardian, and his Queen's Defence.</l>
<l>Great <hi>Burleigh,</hi> thou whose Patriot Bosom beats</l>
<l>With <hi>Albion</hi>'s Glory, and <hi>Eliza</hi>'s Fame;</l>
<l>Who shield'st her Person, and support'st her Throne:</l>
<l>For thee, what fervent Thanks, what offer'd Vows,</l>
<l>Do prostrate Millions pay!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>Bright Excellence,</l>
<l>This fair Applause too highly over-rates,</l>
<l>To much extols the low Deserts of <hi>Cecil.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="12"/>
<speaker>NOTTINGHAM.</speaker>
<l>What Praises are too high for Patriot-Worth;</l>
<l>Or what Applause exceeds the Price of Virtue?</l>
<l>My Lord, Conviction has at last subdu'd me,</l>
<l>And I am Honour's Proselyte;—too long</l>
<l>My erring Heart pursu'd the Ways of Faction;</l>
<l>Lown myself t' have been your bitt'rest Foe,</l>
<l>And join'd with <hi>Essex</hi> in each soul Attempt</l>
<l>To blast your Honour, and traduce your Fame.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>Tho' ne'er my wishing Heart could call you Friend,</l>
<l>Yet Honour and Esteem I always bore you;</l>
<l>And never meant, but with Respect to serve you.</l>
<l>It grieves me, Madam, to have thus offended,</l>
<l>Where most my Wishes labour'd to oblige.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NOTTINGHAM.</speaker>
<l>I know your Honour and your Virtues well;</l>
<l>Your public Plans, design'd for <hi>England</hi>'s Good,</l>
<l>And ad your private Merit's Weight.—But, Oh,</l>
<l>How blind is Reason in the Maze of Passion!</l>
<l>I sought your Ruin, labour'd for your Fall.</l>
<l>But it Repentance may attone for Guilt,</l>
<l>Or Self-reproach for sharpest Penance pass;</l>
<l>No mortal Breast e'er felt more Woe than mine,</l>
<l>And <hi>burleigh</hi> now may rank me for his Friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>That such a Worth of Soul should be abus'd!</l>
<l>Could I accuse my Heart but of a Thought</l>
<l>To do you Wrong? If any Purpose ever</l>
<l>Against your Welfare in my Soul arose,</l>
<l>That look'd with Malice on your shining Merit,</l>
<l>Your matchless Beauty, or your brighter Virtues;</l>
<l>Then let me live despis'd, a Proverb made</l>
<l>To every passing Slave; nay more, the Scorn</l>
<l>And trampl'd Footstool of the Man I hate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="13"/>
<speaker>NOTTINGHAM.</speaker>
<l>It is enough, my Lord, I know it well,</l>
<l>And feel rekindling Virtue warm my Breast;</l>
<l>Honour and Gratitude their Force resume</l>
<l>Within my Heart, and every Wish is your's.</l>
<l>O <hi>Cecil, Cecil,</hi> what a Foe hast thou,</l>
<l>A deadly Foe, whilst hated <hi>Essex</hi> lives.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>I know it well, but can assign no Cause.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NOTTINGHAM.</speaker>
<l>Ambition's restless Hand has wound his Thoughts</l>
<l>Too high for <hi>England</hi>'s Welfare; nay, the Queen</l>
<l>Scarce sits in Safety on her Throne while he,</l>
<l>Th' audacious <hi>Essex,</hi> freely treads at large,</l>
<l>And breathes the common Air. Ambition is</l>
<l>The only God he serves, to whom he'd sacrifice</l>
<l>His Honour, Country, Friends, and every Tye</l>
<l>Of Truth, and Bond of Nature; nay, his Love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>I find this Bus'ness works as I would have it.</l>
<stage>Aside</stage>
<l>The Man that in his public Duty fails,</l>
<l>On private Virtues will disdainful tread,</l>
<l>As Steps to raise him to some higher Purpose;</l>
<l>In vain each softer Wish would plead with him,</l>
<l>No tender Movement in his Soul prevails,</l>
<l>And mighty Love, who rules all Nature else,</l>
<l>Must follow here in proud Ambition's Train.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NOTTINGHAM.</speaker>
<l>Pronounce it not, my Soul abhors the Sound,</l>
<l>Like Death. — O <hi>Cecil,</hi> will you kindly lend</l>
<l>Some Pity to a Wretch like me!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>Command,</l>
<l>Madam; my Power and Will are yours. I feel</l>
<l>Your Wrongs, I feel the base Returns you've met</l>
<l>From this ungrateful and disloyal Man,</l>
<l>Tho' oft your Goodness screen'd him from Reproof;</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="14"/>
Believe me worthy to partake your Grievance,</l>
<l>Accept my Service, and employ my Power.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NOTTINGHAM.</speaker>
<l>Will <hi>Cecil</hi>'s friendly Ear vouchsafe to bend</l>
<l>It's great Attention to a Woman's Wrongs,</l>
<l>Whose Pride and Shame, Resentment and Despair,</l>
<l>Rise up in raging Anarchy at once,</l>
<l>To tear with ceaseless Pangs my tortur'd Soul?</l>
<l>Words are unequal to the Woes I feel,</l>
<l>And Language lessens what my Heart endures.</l>
<l>Passion repuls'd with Scorn, and proud Disdain,</l>
<l>Recoils indignant on my shrinking Soul,</l>
<l>Beats back my vital Springs, and crushes Life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>Madam your Wrongs, I must confess, are great;</l>
<l>Yet still. I fear, you know not half his Falshood.</l>
<l>Who, that had Eyes to look on Beauty? Who,</l>
<l>That had a Heart to feel that Beauty's Power?</l>
<l>Who, but the false, perfidious <hi>Essex,</hi> cou'd</l>
<l>Prefer to <hi>Nottingham</hi> a <hi>Rutland</hi>'s Charms?</l>
<l>Start not. — By Heav'n I tell you nought but Truth,</l>

<l>She paus'd, like Thunder in some kindling Cloud,</l>
<l>Then instant burst with dreadful Fury forth:</l>
<l>And has th' ungrateful Wretch defy'd my Mandate?</l>
<l>The proud, audacious Traytor scorn'd my Power?</l>
<l>He dares not sure.—He dies—the Villain dies!</l>
<l>Then, sudden, soften'd into milder Sounds,</l>

<l>Had driv'n him to Extremes—my Malice did it,</l>

<l>Or Fury cou'd suggest.—I beg'd to know</l>
<l>Her Royal Will concerning <hi>Essex,</hi> urg'd</l>

<l>Was this; that <hi>Essex</hi> shou'd alarm the Citizens</l>
<l>To open Mutiny, and bold Rebellion;</l>
<l>On this pernicious Errand went the Earl,</l>
<l>Join'd by his desp'rate and seditious Friends.</l>
<l>Their Purpose was to seize your Royal Palace,</l>

<l>That Death alone can calm the raging Conflict.</l>

<l>But if Forgiveness from an injur'd Queen</l>

<l>And yet the Source of all my greatest Faults</l>
<l>Was Loyalty misled, and Duty in Extreme.</l>
<l>So jealous was my sanguine Heart, so warm</l>

<l>Suspicion of my Duty to my Queen.</l>
<l>This drove me from my high Command in <hi>Ireland,</hi></l>

<l>To save his Life.</l>

<l>'Tis Mercy's Voice that speaks.</l>
<l>My <hi>Essex</hi> shall again be mine. My Queen,</l>
<l>My bounteous, gracious Queen has said the Word.</l>
<l>May Troops of Angels guard thy sacred Life,</l>
<l><pb n="56" facs="67"/>
And, in thy latest Moments, wast thy Soul</l>
<l>To meet that Mercy, in the Realms of Joy,</l>
<l>Which now thy royal Goodness grants to me.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>Madam, your Orders came, alas! too late.</l>
<l>Ere they arriv'd the Ax had fall'n on <hi>Essex.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUTLAND.</speaker>
<l>Ha! dead! What Hell is this that opens round me?</l>
<l>What Fiend art thou that draws the horrid Scene?</l>
<l>Hah <hi>Burleigh!</hi> bloody Murd'rer, where's my Husband!</l>
<l>O where's my Lord, my <hi>Essex?</hi></l>
<l>Destruction seize and Madness rend my Brain.</l>
<l>See, see, they bend him to the fatal Block;</l>
<l>Now now the horrid Ax is lifted high,</l>
<l>It falls, it falls, he bleeds, he bleeds, he dies!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<l>Alas, her Sorrows pierce my suffering Heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUTLAND.</speaker>
<l>Eternal Discord tear the social World,</l>
<l>And Nature's Laws dissolve! expunge, erase</l>
<l>The hated Marks of Time's engraving Hand,</l>
<l>And every Trace destroy! Arise, Despair,</l>
<l>Assert thy rightful Claim, possess me all!</l>
<l>Bear, bear me to my murther'd Lord, to clasp</l>
<l>His bleeding Body in my dying Arms;</l>
<l>And in the Tomb embrace his dear Remains,</l>
<l>And mingle with his Dust for ever.</l>

<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<l>Hapless Woman!</l>
<l>She shall henceforth be Partner of my Sorrows.</l>
<l>And we'll contend who most shall weep for <hi>Essex.</hi></l>
<l>O quick to kill, and ready to destroy,</l>
<stage><hi>To</hi> Burleigh.</stage>
<l>Cou'd no Pretext be found, no Cause appear,</l>
<l><pb n="61" facs="68"/>
To lengthen Mercy out a Moment more,</l>
<l>And stretch the Span of Grace? O cruel <hi>Burleigh!</hi></l>
<l>This, this was thy dark Work, unpitying Man!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BURLEIGH.</speaker>
<l>My gracious Mistress, blame not thus my Duty,</l>
<l>My firm Obedience to your high Command.</l>
<l>The Laws condemn'd him first to die; nor think</l>
<l>I stood between your Mercy and his Life.</l>
<l>It was the Lady <hi>Notingham,</hi> not I.</l>
<l>Herself confess'd it all, in wild Despair,</l>
<l>That from your Majesty to <hi>Essex</hi> sent,</l>
<l>With Terms of proffer'd Grace, she then receiv'd</l>
<l>From his own Hand a fatal Ring, a Pledge,</l>
<l>It seems, of much Importance, which the Earl,</l>
<l>With earnest Suit, and warm Entreaty, begg'd her,</l>
<l>As she would prize his Life, to give your Majesty.</l>
<l>In this she fail'd—in this she murder'd <hi>Essex.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<l>O barbarous Woman!</l>
<l>Surrounded still by Treachery and Fraud!</l>
<l>What bloody Deed is this? Thou injur'd <hi>Essex!</hi></l>
<l>My Fame is soil'd to all succeeding Times:</l>
<l>But Heav'n alone can view my breaking Heart;</l>
<l>Then let it's Will be done.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<l>From hence let proud, resisting Mortals know</l>
<l>The Arm parental, and th' indulgent Blow.</l>
<l>To Heav'n's corrective Rod, submissive, bend,</l>
<l>Adore it's Wisdom, on it's Power depend;</l>
<l>Whilst ruling Justice guides eternal Sway,</l>
<l>Let Nature tremble, and let Man obey.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>By an Unknown Hand. Spoken by Mrs. CIBBER.</byline>
<sp>
<l>NEWS! News! good Folks, rare News, and you shall know it—</l>
<l>I've got Intelligence about our Poet!</l>
<l>Who do you think be is?—You'll never guess;</l>
<l>An <hi>IRISH BRICKLAYER,</hi> neither more or less.</l>
<l>And now the Secret's out, you cannot wonder,</l>
<l>That in commencing Bard he made a Blunder.</l>
<l>Has be not left the Better for the Worse,</l>
<l>In quitting Solid Brick for empty Verse?</l>
<l>Can he believe th' Example of <hi>Old Ben,</hi></l>
<l>Who chang'd (like him) the Trowel for the Pen,</l>
<l>Will in his Favour move your Critic Bowels?</l>
<l>You rather wish, most Poct's Pons were Trowels,</l>
<l>Our Man is honest, sensible, and plain,</l>
<l>Nor has the Poet made him pert, or vain:</l>
<l>No Beau, no Courtier, nor conceited Youth;</l>
<l>But then so rude, <hi>he always speaks the Truth:</hi></l>
<l>I told him he must flatter, learn Address,</l>
<l>And gain the Heart of some rich Patroness:</l>
<l>'Tis she, said I, your Labours will reward,</l>
<l>If you but join the Bricklay'r with the Bard;</l>
<l>As thus—Should she be old and worse for Wear,</l>
<l>You must new-<hi>case</hi> her, <hi>front</hi> her and <hi>repair;</hi></l>
<l>If crack'd in Fame, as scarce to bear a Touch,</l>
<l>You cannot use your <hi>Trowel</hi> then too much;</l>
<l><pb facs="70"/>
In short, whate'er her Morals, Age or Station,</l>
<l><hi>Plaister</hi> and <hi>white-wash</hi> in your Dedication.</l>
<l>Thus I advis'd—but he detests the Plan:</l>
<l>What can be done with such a simple Man?</l>
<l>A Poet's nothing worth and nought availing,</l>
<l>Unless he'll furnish, where there is a Failing.</l>
<l>Authors in these good Times are made and us'd,</l>
<l>To grant those Favours Nature has refus'd.</l>
<l>If he won't <hi>fib,</hi> what Bounty can be crave?</l>
<l>We pay for what we want, not what we have.—</l>
<l>Nay tho' of every <hi>Blessing</hi> we have store,</l>
<l>Our Sex will always wish—a little more.—</l>
<l>If he'll not bend his Heart to this his Duty,</l>
<l>And sell (to who will buy) Wit, Honour, Beauty;</l>
<l>The Bricklay'r still for him the proper Trade is,</l>
<l>Too rough to deal with Gentlemen and Ladies.—</l>
<l>In short—they'll all avoid him and neglect him,</l>
<l>Unless that you his <hi>Patrons</hi> will protect him.</l>
