<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. GARRICK.</byline>
<l>WHEN Philip's son led forth his warlike band,</l>
<l>To die, or conquer, in a distant land;</l>
<l>To fan the fire, a martial muse he chose;</l>
<l>From Homer's song a new Achilles rose!</l>
<l>When generous Athens her prime trophies won,</l>
<l>Vanquisb'd Darius, and Darius' son,</l>
<l>The stage breath'd war—the soldiers bosom burn'd,</l>
<l>And fiercer to the field each chief return'd:</l>
<l>Now, when the world resounds with loud alarms,</l>
<l>When victory sits plan'd on Britain's arms,</l>
<l>Be war our theme: the hero's glorious toil,</l>
<l>And virtue springing from the iron soil!</l>
<l>Our scenes present a siege in story known;</l>
<l>Where magnanimity, and valour shone:</l>
<l>If nature guides us, if the hand of truth</l>
<l>Draws the just portrait of a Roman youth,</l>
<l>Who, with the best and noblest passions sir'd,</l>
<l>In the same moment, conquer'd and expir'd;</l>
<l>Perhaps your bearts may own the pictur'd woe,</l>
<l>And from a fonder source your sorrows flow:</l>
<l>Whilst warm remembrance aids the poet's strain,</l>
<l>And England weeps for English heroes slain.</l>

<head>ACT. I. SCENE I.</head>
<stage>The Palace Court.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> PAULUS <hi>and</hi> TITUS.</stage>
<sp>
<l>THIS is no time to strive for vain renown.</l>
<l>The fate of Rome, remember that, my brother!</l>
<l>Depends on the Defence of Aquileia.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>PAULUS, I know.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAULUS.</speaker>
<l>But thou dost not consider</l>
<l>Th' importance of this war. We fight not now,</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="5"/>
As oft since Freedom fell our fathers fought,</l>
<l>When Latian chiefs contended who should reign,</l>
<l>With half the senate listed on each side;</l>
<l>The victor still was Roman, and rever'd</l>
<l>The gods and temples of immortal Rome.</l>
<l>But o'er yon mighty host, that girds our walls,</l>
<l>Fierce MAXIMIN commands: whether of Thrace,</l>
<l>Or wild Dalmatia, so obscure his birth,</l>
<l>Himself scarce knows; but sure Barbarian born.</l>
<l>This savage soldier, nurs'd in blood and war,</l>
<l>Whom military frenzy hath set up</l>
<l>To trample on mankind, abhors a Roman;</l>
<l>And marks for death the noble and the brave.</l>
<l>His yoke, at last, th' indignant senate scorns,</l>
<l>The slumb'ring Genius of our country wakes,</l>
<l>And rouses slothful Italy to arms.</l>
<l>The furious tyrant from the frontier hastes,</l>
<l>Like a wild beast gall'd by the hunter's spear,</l>
<l>And, breathing vengeance, rushes upon Rome:</l>
<l>Here first oppos'd, tenfold his fury burns;</l>
<l>Here, in the pass of fate, our father stands,</l>
<l>Defies and stops the monster in his rage,</l>
<l>Till Rome's last legions come to give him battle.</l>
<l>Now, when a soldier's life is of such moment,</l>
<l>When destiny hangs on a single day,</l>
<l>To fight for glory, TITUS, were a crime.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>No, PAULUS, no! it is not fame alone</l>
<l>That TITUS seeks to purchase from the foe;</l>
<l>Tho' such a crime the gods and men would pardon.</l>
<l>I know the peril that o'er Rome impends,</l>
<l>And know the hated cause of all our ills,</l>
<l>That army, only brave against their country,</l>
<l>I mean to smite them, and their giant leader,</l>
<l>Whom nature for a gladiator form'd,</l>
<l>To be the sport, and not the lord, of Rome.</l>
<l>The blow once struck, our foe must raise the siege,</l>
<l>Or waste his veterans in vain attacks,</l>
<l>And give to GORDIANUS easy conquest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAULUS.</speaker>
<l>Were this a frontier city far from Rome,</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="6"/>
And yon huge host compos'd of foes remote,</l>
<l>German, or Parthian; I would say to thee,</l>
<l>Lead on, my brother! Shield to shield we'd go,</l>
<l>And fire yon turret, or together perish.</l>
<l>But now when conquest by delay is gain'd,</l>
<l>When Aquileia guards the walls of Rome,</l>
<l>Dread of the great event has so possess'd me,</l>
<l>That, like the Persian soldier, I could stay</l>
<l>My arm uplifted, patient to the call</l>
<l>Of cautious Duty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>And renouncing fame?</l>
<l>Oh! PAULUS! you have gain'd long since the prize</l>
<l>That I contend for. Every martial palm</l>
<l>Thy sword hath won. When I, like thee, am great</l>
<l>In deeds of arms, like thee I may be wary.</l>
<l>Now to my brother I lay bare my breast:</l>
<l>This famous siege approaches to its end;</l>
<l>Whatever end the ruling gods ordain,</l>
<l>Yet no distinguish'd action graces me.</l>
<l>I've done my duty. That I reckon nothing;</l>
<l>The meanest soldier has not shrunk from duty;</l>
<l>Son of AEMILIUS, and thy brother, PAULUS!</l>
<l>I must do more, and by the gods I will!</l>
<l>Here I have found a path that leads to glory;</l>
<l>Do not oppose me, else—we're friends no more.—</l>
<l>Our father comes. Speak not against my purpose,</l>
<l>And I shall move the consul's noble mind.</l>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> AEMILIUS.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>Health to my sons!</l>
<stage>PAULUS <hi>and</hi> TITUS.</stage>
<l>Heaven guard our father's life!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>And bless my children! ha! your looks are keen.</l>
<l>Your's chiefly, TITUS! what hath stirr'd your spirit?</l>
<l>How points the enemy? This quiet night,</l>
<l>In preparation past, portends a storm.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAULUS.</speaker>
<l>On that attack which threats the eastern gate</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="7"/>
The enemy hath labour'd all night long,</l>
<l>Repairing what the river's rage had ruin'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>It was a friendly flood. The river god</l>
<l>With all his waters guards his native walls;</l>
<l>On that strong quarter they can ne'er prevail.</l>
<l>The north I fear, where yon stupendous tower</l>
<l>Our works commands.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>It shall not long command,</l>
<l>Let but the consul grant me my desire.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>What would my son?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Their tower is weakly guarded.</l>
<l>At break of day, a soldier from yon camp</l>
<l>Fled to my post; hollow and gaunt he was;</l>
<l>His shrivell'd limbs scarce bore his sounding arms.</l>
<l>Like him, he said, with toil and famine worn,</l>
<l>Were half the tyrant's host. For MAXIMIN,</l>
<l>Mad with delay, and fiercer from repulse,</l>
<l>Reviles his soldiers, drives them to the trench</l>
<l>With whips and sharp reproach. This day, o'ercome</l>
<l>By strong necessity, he breathes a while,</l>
<l>And sends his legions forth, to gather in</l>
<l>Whatever this exhausted region yields.</l>
<l>I saw the busy foragers in troops</l>
<l>March, and disperse themselves on every side,</l>
<l>Like playful children on a summer day,</l>
<l>Secure and careless; for no martial band</l>
<l>Of late hath sallied from our guarded gates.</l>
<l>This is the time. Permit me, O my father!</l>
<l>Now to attack their ill defended lines,</l>
<l>And fire that mighty tower in which they trust.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>Well hast thou spoke, my son! thy zeal I love,</l>
<l>Nor must thy skill and judgment pass unprais'd.</l>
<l>Be thus attentive still, and trust me, TITUS,</l>
<l>In future sieges, and in other wars,</l>
<l>Swift execution shall thy purpose honour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="8"/>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Ne'er shall I see another siege like this,</l>
<l>Ne'er draw my sword in such a glorious cause.</l>
<l>Alas! my lord! check not my spring of thought,</l>
<l>Nor nip the only bud it yet has borne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>Riper occasions will thy valour claim.</l>
<l>Danger comes on; Typhaeus-like it comes,</l>
<l>Whose fabled stature every hour encreas'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>O! judge not of the counsel by the weight</l>
<l>Of him that gives it. Would to heaven, my lord!</l>
<l>That I could now divest me of that youth</l>
<l>Which mars my credit. Chearfully I'd step</l>
<l>Far into age, to gain but for a day</l>
<l>The grave authority which years bestow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAULUS.</speaker>
<l>What brings the brave Numidian GARTHA hither?</l>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> GARTHA.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GARTHA.</speaker>
<l>Hail to the general!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>Hail, valiant GARTHA.</l>
<l>How has the morning past where you command?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GARTHA.</speaker>
<l>It has been busy. The presumptuous foe</l>
<l>In loose disorder'd squadrons rang'd the fields.</l>
<l>I watch'd the time; and sudden as the blast</l>
<l>That rises in the desart, out we rush'd</l>
<l>And swept them from the plain. Safe in our speed</l>
<l>We urg'd the chace far as the rising ground,</l>
<l>And unmolested view'd the camp below.</l>
<l>This worthy of your notice I observ'd,</l>
<l>Their wond'rous tower, the work of many a day,</l>
<l>Stands now protected by a feeble guard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Thanks for thy welcome tidings, noble GARTHA!</l>
<l>The guardian gods of Rome bend from their skies,</l>
<l>And point this action out. Hear me, my father!</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="9"/>
If ever since my birth I gave thee joy,</l>
<l>If e'er thou did'st, as parents oft are wont,</l>
<l>Interpret large the promise of my childhood,</l>
<l>O hear and grant my chief and dear request!</l>
<l>Let me go forth: be this my first exploit,</l>
<l>To wrap in fire the tyrant's boasted tower;</l>
<l>That Rome, who glories in the Aemilian line,</l>
<l>May join your TITUS to his kindred names!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>In thee the spirit of thy fathers speak,</l>
<l>Or some superior power thy bosom fires,</l>
<l>Whom I oppose no more. Go, and fulfil</l>
<l>Thy destiny. Brave GARTHA too shall add</l>
<l>His troops to thine. Prepare what else—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>'Tis done.</l>
<l>Destructive instruments and balls of fire</l>
<l>Are ready at the gate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>Farewel, my son!</l>
<l>If you prevail, urge not too far your fortune.</l>
<l>Remember still my words; that when we meet,</l>
<l>I may have cause to praise thy conduct then,</l>
<l>As now thy courage, TITUS.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>CORNELIA.</speaker>
<l>From whence, AEMILIUS?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>From the northern gate.</l>
<l>TITUS had form'd a brave, a great design;</l>
<l>But when assurance of relief arriv'd,</l>
<l>My PAULUS hasten'd to recal his brother.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CORNELIA.</speaker>
<l>'Tis as I fear'd. PAULUS will come too late.</l>
<l>The omens of the gods must be fulfill'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>What evil omens has CORNELIA seen?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CORNELIA.</speaker>
<l>'Tis strange to tell; but as I slumb'ring lay,</l>
<l>About that hour when glad Aurora springs,</l>
<l>To chace the lagging shades, methought I was</l>
<l>In Rome, and full of peace the city seem'd.</l>
<l>My mind oblivious too had lost it's care.</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="12"/>
Serene I step'd along the lofty hall,</l>
<l>Imbellish'd with the statues of our fathers,</l>
<l>When suddenly an universal groan</l>
<l>Issued at once from every marble breast.</l>
<l>Aghast I gaz'd around! when slowly down</l>
<l>From their high pedestals I saw descend</l>
<l>The murder'd GRACCHI. Hand in hand, the brothers</l>
<l>Stalk'd towards me. As they approach'd more near,</l>
<l>They were no more the GRACCHI, but my sons</l>
<l>PAULUS and TITUS. At that dreadful change</l>
<l>I shriek'd and wak'd. But never from my mind</l>
<l>The spectacle shall part. Their rueful eyes!</l>
<l>Their cheeks of stone! the look of death and woe!</l>
<l>So strange a vision ne'er from fancy rose.</l>
<l>The rest, my lord! this holy Priest can tell.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>Why this is nothing but a common dream;</l>
<l>For often when the waking mind is charg'd</l>
<l>With apprehension of uncertain ills,</l>
<l>Imagination, in the hour of rest,</l>
<l>Presenteth wild fantastic combinations,</l>
<l>That have a shade and tincture of the past:</l>
<l>But 'tis the weakness of the human mind</l>
<l>That joins the vain assemblage to futurity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRIEST.</speaker>
<l>Men reason thus, my lord! who think their reason</l>
<l>Can grasp and measure all; presumptuous thought!</l>
<l>Sounds more than human have been often heard,</l>
<l>And shapes celestial seen, by mortal man;</l>
<l>But yet most frequent in the silent night</l>
<l>Are warnings given by strange portentuous dreams.</l>
<l>The history of mighty Rome abounds</l>
<l>In awful instances. The old republic</l>
<l>By them has oft been sway'd; and oft preferv'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>But tell me, Priest of JOVE! what do the gods</l>
<l>By their more certain omens now declare?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRIEST.</speaker>
<l>Consul! with the most venerable rites</l>
<l>That our religion knows, I have perform'd</l>
<l><pb n="14" facs="13"/>
A sacrifice to Capitolian JOVE,</l>
<l>This pious matron present: never yet</l>
<l>Since at the altars of the gods I stood</l>
<l>Did I behold such omens of calamity.</l>

<l>Great are thy woes, CORNELIA, great indeed!</l>

<l>The famous matron of thy name and blood,</l>
<l>The first CORNELIA, saw her godlike sons</l>
<l>In Rome betray'd, and slain by Roman hands.</l>
<l>And oft in every age have wretched mothers</l>
<l>Surviv'd their families', their country's ruin,</l>
<l>And liv'd sad captives in a foreign land:</l>
<l>No kindred ear to hear, no eye to weep</l>

<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>It is the right, the birthright, of our house,</l>
<l>For Rome to die: in every signal strife,</l>
<l>In every struggling period of the state,</l>
<l>My sires have bled. My sons have chose their time;</l>
<l>Bravely they fought, and nobly were they slain.</l>
<l>Rome still shall stand, tho' the AEMILII fall.</l>
<l>The tyrant's works are levell'd with the ground,</l>
<l>And his proud tower yet smokes upon the plain.</l>
<l>Our ramparts now his fierce assaults desy;</l>
<l>The Roman army, like a gather'd storm,</l>
<l>Rolls towards him. My sons shall be reveng'd;</l>
<l>My eyes shall see, my sword shall share, the vengeance.</l>

<speaker>CORNELIA.</speaker>
<l>Mean while, unburied on the bloody field,</l>
<l>Amidst the common heap, my children lie.</l>
<l>Majestic PAULUS, and my lovely TITUS,</l>
<l>Is this the end of all your mother's care?</l>
<l>Some fierce barbarian now insults the dead;</l>
<l>Adding dishonest wounds. O! might not gold</l>
<l>Their dear remains redeem? Alas! alas!</l>
<l>'Tis the sole consolation I can hope for,</l>
<l>To save them from the beasts and birds of prey,</l>
<l>That howl and scream around these fatal walls.</l>
<l>To fold once more their bodies in my arms;</l>
<l>To lay them decent on the funeral pile,</l>
<l>And o'er their ashes pour a parent's heart.</l>

<l>Charges the senate and the Roman people</l>
<l>With breach of vows, and unprovok'd rebellion;</l>
<l>But chiefly thee, who first withstood thy sovereign,</l>
<l>And stopt the progress of his just revenge.</l>
<l>The righteous gods, he saith, to thee averse,</l>
<l>Have made thy sons the captives of his arms;</l>
<l>Them he has doom'd to death, and will this day</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>I stand now not in equal lists with MAXIMIN,</l>
<l>Nor mean I here to plead the cause of Rome:</l>
<l>'Twould but offend thine ear. Yet tell thy lord,</l>
<l>He knows AEMILIUS not, and therefore wrongs him</l>
<l>By this unworthy trial of his faith;</l>
<l>Unhappy, most unhappy, he may make me,</l>
<l>But he and fortune cannot make me base.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>He will return, CORNELIA! doubt not that.</l>
<l>The tyrant knows the snare in which we're caught,</l>
<l>And to the uttermost will prove our souls</l>
<l>Before he breaks it.</l>
</sp>

<l>If I consent? alas!</l>
<l>That doubt implies suspicion of the means.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CORNELIA.</speaker>
<l>Hear me, and judge: capitulate with MAXIMIN,</l>
<l>In three days hence to yield up Aquileia,</l>
<l>If not reliev'd. Before that time expires,</l>
<l>The arms of Rome victorious raise the siege;</l>
<l>Or, if defeated, make resistance vain.</l>
<l>Bend not thine eye, AEMILIUS, on the ground!</l>
<l>The strictest law of duty is fulfill'd.</l>
<l>If thou reject'st this counsel, I will say,</l>
<l>Not MAXIMIN the tyrant slew my children,</l>
<l>But their own cruel father.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>VARUS.</speaker>
<l>Oh! too just thy fears!</l>
<l>Of my lov'd kinsmen unrevok'd the doom!</l>
<l>VARUS hath kneel'd in vain. Hard as the rocks</l>
<l>Of wild Dalmatia, is the tyrant's heart.</l>
<l>Incens'd at the refusal which I bore,</l>
<l>His fury rages like a fire confin'd,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VARUS.</speaker>
<l>The tyrant (lend me patience, Heaven!</l>
<l>To speak with calmness, I who serve him still)</l>
<l>This day hath vow'd to raze imperial Rome.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>Barbarian! why?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VARUS.</speaker>
<l>To fix his wavering host,</l>
<l>To glut his legions with the mighty spoil.</l>
<l>Disease and famine prey upon his troops,</l>
<l>And rumour cries, that a relief is near.</l>
<l>The soldiers faint, and murmur at the length</l>
<l>And havock of this siege. The crafty tyrant</l>
<l>With sound of trumpet thro' the camp proclaim'd,</l>
<l>That he will give the city to be sack'd,</l>
<l>Raze her proud walls, and change the seat of empire.</l>
<l>The glad Barbarians shouted to the skies,</l>
<l>And mix'd with their applause unheard-of oaths</l>
<l>To die with MAXIMIN.</l>

<l>Was there no Roman near enough to plant</l>
<l>A dagger in the heart of MAXIMIN?</l>
</sp>

<speaker>VARUS.</speaker>
<l>Before the tyrant reach the walls of Rome,</l>
<l>That Roman may be found.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>Above the name</l>
<l>Of god-like SCAEVOLA his fame shall rise.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VARUS.</speaker>
<l>The righteous gods, whom MAXIMIN contemns,</l>
<l>Have in their vengeance urg'd his frantic mind</l>
<l>By this decree to work his own perdition.</l>
<l>Long honour'd Rome! tho' thou hast lost so much</l>
<l>Of thy primaeval splendor, still my heart</l>
<l>Thy image worships; still for thee I fought,</l>
<l>And from Siluria, to the savage shore</l>
<l>Of Caledonia, I thy trophies rear'd!</l>
<l>And shall thy soldier draw his sword against thee,</l>
<l>Or stand a tame spectator of thy fall?</l>
<l>No! I am thine, devoted, as of old</l>
<l>Thy darling sons, when first thy glory rose.</l>
<l>Nor shall thy turrets bow, imperial Rome!</l>
<l>Till low in dust the head of VARUS lies.</l>

<l>A truce I'll offer, bind myself by vow</l>

<l>The port of TITUS shew'd a mind less calm,</l>
<l>Around he look'd, and from his scornful eyes,</l>

<l>At last in earnest speech the brothers join'd.</l>
<l>I saw them whisper; PAULUS bow'd his head.</l>
<l>The multitude, long silent at my presence,</l>
<l>Lamented then; the weeping mothers clasp'd</l>
<l>Their infants to their breasts, and look'd at me.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Nothing shall hold me. I have deeply sworn,</l>
<l>And left my brother pledge of my return;</l>
<l>Left him, to bear alone the tyrant's rage,</l>
<l><pb n="52" facs="51"/>
To die by torture, if I break my faith.</l>
<l>Thus would'st thou buy my life! Unhand me streight,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>Thy frenzy, woman,</l>
<l>Cuts off our last resource, adds shame to ruin;</l>
<l>I will not, cannot succour noble VARUS,</l>

<l>The clamour ceases, Oh! what hast thou done?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CORNELIA.</speaker>
<l>There, let him go, and perish with his brother.</l>
<l>Forgive this action; for excess of anguish</l>
<l>Deprives CORNELIA of her reason's aid.</l>

<l>Turn to the gate thy steps, I follow thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<stage><hi>[To</hi> AEMILIUS.]</stage>
<l>Roman! once more, tho' not from love, I speak;</l>
<l>Yield thee, for now thou hast no hope in VARUS.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>Who told thee, that my resolution stood</l>
<l>On such a hope? What hath befallen VARUS?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DUMNORIX.</speaker>
<l>His treason is detected; he himself</l>
<l>Seiz'd, and condemn'd with thy rash sons to die.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CORNELIA.</speaker>
<l>Eternal god!—How did the legions brook</l>
<l>Their valiant leader's fate?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DUMNORIX.</speaker>
<l>Her tongue betrays</l>
<l>Your secret expectation of revolt,</l>
<l>Where all is calm submission. VARUS came</l>
<l>From hence, entrusted with your last resolve,</l>
<l>And, like an orator, addrest himself,</l>
<l>To the tribunal, with a voice so rais'd,</l>
<l>That every soldier in the circle heard;</l>
<l><pb n="53" facs="52"/>
And as he told a tale to move their pity,</l>
<l>A sudden murmur rose. The emperor</l>
<l>Leapt from his throne, and call'd aloud to seize</l>
<l>The artful traytor. Soon his guards obey'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker>
<l>VARUS, the noble VARUS, too must die.</l>
<l>But there are gods above! Vengeance is theirs,</l>
<l>The tyrant yet shall feel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CORNELIA.</speaker>
<l>Will vengeance raise</l>
<l>My children from the tomb?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DUMNORIX.</speaker>
<l>Thou question'st well.</l>
<l>Matron, I pity thee. Canst thou not move</l>
<l>Thy husband's heart to spare his dying sons,</l>
<l>Nor win thy children to consent to live?</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. CIBBER.</byline>
<lg>
<l>OUR Author, as I'm told, is not to seek</l>
<l>In antient Lore; in Latin, nor in Greek.</l>
<l>I therefore did advise him, as a friend,</l>
<l>To make his learning serve some useful end:</l>
<l>And let me know, what rules he had observ'd,</l>
<l>What unities of time and place preserv'd.</l>
<l>He answer'd, Poetry is not an art;</l>
<l>'Tis nature only frames the poet's heart:</l>
<l>Still as he thinks, the scene he feels along,</l>
<l>And from his bosom bursts the raptur'd song.</l>
<l>This is the sacred oracle, the shrine</l>
<l>The bard consults, and here, the tuneful Nine.</l>
<l>With the same fire, the hearer's soul must glow,</l>
<l>Else vain to him, the tale of tragick woe.</l>
<l>There is a temper, which is all and all:</l>
<l>That sounds responsive to the poet's call.</l>
<l>Like Memnon's harp, which pour'd harmonious lays,</l>
<l>Whene'er its strings were touch'd by Phoebus' rays.</l>
<l>This temper of the soul is sweet and wild;</l>
<l>It sobs, or smiles, as sudden as a child;</l>
<l>To woes imagin'd tears unfeigned gives,</l>
<l>And in the poet's world of fancy lives.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Whilst thus he spoke, a bell was heard to ring;</l>
<l>He stop'd, and started like a guilty thing;</l>
<l>Ere the dread curtain rose, in haste withdrew,</l>
<l>And at a distance wails his doom from you.</l>
