<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>THE aversion a woman ought to feel at the necessity of engaging even in a literary contest has induced me to endure a variety of imputations; yet, to publish a piece, and leave all unanswered, might at once give a sanction to the past, and encourage future slanders:—let this plead my excuse for introducing myself to those who have so generously received a comedy I would wish more worthy their patronage.</p>
<p>Charged early in life with the care of a family, I accompanied my father eight years ago into the rules of a prison, where the perjury of an enemy, and the injustice of a judge for a time confined him. To amuse some of my melancholy leisure, I there (from a fondness for Marmontel's beautiful tale of Lauretta) first conceived the design of introducing into the Drama a female heart, capable of frailty, yet shuddering at vice, and perhaps sufficiently punished in her own feelings. A lover, whose error was likewise in his heart, not head; and even for him I contrived a chastisement in the agony of losing her: nor did I imagine, in adopting a religious tenet, I could ever be accused of offending morality. Subsequent characters and incidents arose in the manner they now appear, except that the governor had then no place in it. It is now seven years since the piece was brought thus forward; soon after which a friend lent me a translation of Monsieur Diderot's Pere de Famille.—This fine performance gave me infinite pleasure under all the disadvantages of a translation; and the chance-similitude
<pb n="iii" facs="5"/>
which now and then occurred between that and mine rather flattered than grieved me, since, conscious of my own originality, and imagining even my worst enemy, if he charged me with a plagiarism, would at least allow, while the subject was new to our stage, my only crime was in denying it.—I returned the translated play, and mine lay dormant several years. Sentiment was now exploded, and I therefore sought to diversify it with humour. The character of the austere Commander in Monsieur Diderot's play had particularly pleased me; and not being mistress of the French language, I sought in vain for a translation, on purpose to interweave him into mine. Not able to meet with any, I created the character of Governor Harcourt, whose chief likeness to the French uncle is in name) and heightened the piece with every event relative to him: but an unbounded partiality I must ever retain for music made me finish it as a three act opera.</p>
<p>In the interim my father had been engaged as a capital Actor by Mr. Harris. Life opened gradually upon me, and dissipated the illusions of imagination. I learnt that merit merely is a very insufficient recommendation to managers in general; and as I had neither a prostituted pen or person to offer Mr. Harris, I gave up, without a trial, all thoughts of the Drama, and sought an humble home in Bath, resolving to bury in my own heart its little talent, and be a poor any thing rather than a poor author. Some valuable friends, I had long possessed there, insisted I should be wanting to myself in consigning this piece voluntarily to oblivion, and offered me a recommendation to Mr. Harris, with a promise of concealing my name, unless it was accepted. I could desire nothing more: and under these circumstances it was put into that gentleman's
<pb n="iv" facs="6"/>
hands above a twelvemonth ago. The praises he gave it induced my friend to own my name, and from that moment (let his conscience tell him why) it sunk in Mr. Harris's favour. He said he had frequently refused a play of Mr. Macklin's taken from le Pere de Famille, and could not accept another on the same subject; insisted, that the serious part of mine was all Diderot's; advised me to cut it entirely out, and convert the humorous part into an after-piece, which be would bring out in the course of the season.—Reasons very remote from the Stage could alone induce me to listen a moment to his proposal, and those brought me a hundred miles to converse with him on the subject; when he produced me the copy sent him, so worn out and dirty, that I had reason to conclude he had lent it to every one he knew, at least.—I was enough mistress of myself to listen with complaisance to the most supercilious and unmeaning criticisms, and agreed to mutilate it according to his ideas. The Actors were now named. I had every reason to imagine it a settled thing; and returning to Bath, sent the reduced copy at the appointed time, viz. early in September. A month elapsed without my even knowing he had received it; when, with the continued ill-manners of addressing me by a third person, (for he never wrote a single line in answer to several letters) I was shewn a paragraph from Mr. Harris by the friend already mentioned, importing, that I "had sent him <hi>four</hi> acts instead of <hi>two,</hi> and must still take away half; adding, that he advised me by all means to retain my own, disregarding Diderot's."—I did retain my own; for, as the manuscript was luckily returned for another alteration, I thought it time to consider what was due to myself, and that the character of mildness and complacency would be rather dearly
<pb n="v" facs="7"/>
bought if I gave up all merit for it; I therefore wrote him a civil letter, and finally withdrew it.</p>
<p>I shall not expatiate on this treatment. I was perhaps in some degree blameable, for believing that man would set any value on my time or my money, who knew not the value of his own; nay, I may be in reality obliged to him in one sense, since his acceptance of my Comedy would inevitably have consigned to oblivion those parts of it honored with the most lavish applause.</p>
<p>What pleasure do I feel in retracting the general aspersion cast upon managers, when I speak of Mr. Colman—Obliged to get the piece represented if possible, lest the subject should be borrowed (an evil too common of late) I enclosed it with an anonymous letter to that Gentleman, briefly relating these particulars, and it was left at his house early in the year by an unknown person. At the expiration of a fortnight the manuscript or his answer was demanded, and the latter by this means rendered both impartial and decisive. Mr. Colman thought the general name of Author entitled to the compliment of his own hand-writing; and, by a flattering opinion, and immediate acceptance of my piece, encouraged me to avow myself. By his advice I cut out the songs, and lengthened it into five acts. Nor did his kindness end there. He gave me the benefit of his judgment and experience, both in heightening and abbreviating the business, with every attention in casting and getting it up; generously uniting to the name of Manager that of Friend Mr. Colman has brought into notice a woman who will ever with pride and pleasure acknowledge the obligation.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>

<byline>Spoken by Mr. PALMER.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>LONG has the passive stage, howe'er absurd,</l>
<l>Been rul'd by <hi>names,</hi> and govern'd by a <hi>word.</hi></l>
<l>Some poor <hi>cant term,</hi> like magick spells can awe,</l>
<l>And bind our realms, like a dramatic law.</l>
<l>When Fielding, Humour's fav'rite child, appear'd,</l>
<l><hi>Low</hi> was the word—a word each author fear'd!</l>
<l>'Till chac'd at length, by pleasantry's bright ray,</l>
<l>Nature and mirth resum'd their legal sway;</l>
<l>And Goldsmith's genius bask'd in open day.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>No beggar, howe'er poor, a cur can lack;</l>
<l>Poor bards, of critic curs, can keep a <hi>pack.</hi></l>
<l>One yelper silenc'd, twenty barkers rise,</l>
<l>And with new <hi>bowls,</hi> their <hi>snarlings</hi> still disguise.</l>
<l><hi>Low</hi> banish'd, the word <hi>sentiment</hi> succeeds;</l>
<l>And at that shrine the modern playwright bleeds.</l>
<l>Hard fate! but let each wou'd-be critic know,</l>
<l>That <hi>sentiments</hi> from genuine <hi>feelings</hi> flow!</l>
<l>Critics in vain declaim, and write, and rail:</l>
<l>Nature, eternal Nature! will prevail.</l>
<l>Give me the bard, who makes me laugh and cry,</l>
<l>Diverts and moves, and all, I scarce know why!</l>
<l>Untaught by commentators, French or Dutch,</l>
<l>Passion still answers to th' electric touch.</l>
<l>Reason, like Falstaff, claims, when all is done,</l>
<l>The honors of the field already won.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb n="vii" facs="9"/>
<l>To-night, our author's is a mixt intent—</l>
<l>Passion and humour—<hi>low</hi> and <hi>sentiment:</hi></l>
<l>Smiling in tears—a serio-comic play—</l>
<l>Sunshine and show'r—a kind of April-Day!</l>
<l>A Lord, whose pride is in his honor plac'd;</l>
<l>A governor, with av'rice not disgrac'd;</l>
<l>An humble priest! a lady, and a lover</l>
<l>So full of virtue, <hi>some of it runs over.</hi></l>
<l>No temporary touches, no allusions</l>
<l>To camps, reviews, and all our late confusions;</l>
<l>No personal reflections, no sharp satire,</l>
<l>But a mere chapter—from the book of Nature.</l>
<l>Wrote by a woman too! the muses now</l>
<l>Few liberties to naughty men allow;</l>
<l>But like old maids on earth, resolv'd to vex,</l>
<l>With cruel coyness treat the other sex.</l>

<p>Ah, my dear creature! how have you done these fifty ages?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="12"/>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<p>Why, methinks, you are grown mighty grand, or you would have come to the still-room to ask; will you chuse any chocolate?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vane.</speaker>
<p>Why don't you see I am dead?—absolutely dead; and, if you was to touch me, I should shake to meer dust, like an Egyptian mummy. Because it was not provoking enough to lounge away a whole summer in the country, here am I driven up to town, as if the devil was at my heels in the shape of our hopeful heir; who has neither suffered my Lord nor me to rest one moment, thro' his confounded impatience to see his uncle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<p>Umph,—he'll have enough of the old gentleman presently. He is the very moral of my poor dear lady, his sister, who never was at peace herself, nor suffer'd any one else to be so. Such a house as we have had ever since he came!—why he is more full of importance and airs than a bailiff in possession; and hectors over Miss Mortimer, 'till she almost keeps her chamber to avoid him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vane.</speaker>
<p>Hates Miss Mortimer!—why, here 'll be the devil to pay about her, I suppose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<p>Hate her? ay, that he does. He look'd, as if he could have kill'd her, the moment she came down to see him; and got into his chamber presently after, where he sends for me.—"Who is this young woman, Mrs. What's your name?" says he. Why, sir, says I, she is the orphan of a Colonel Mortimer, whose intimacy with my Lord, says I—"Pho, pho, says he, all that I know, woman; what does she do in this house?" says he; his face wrinkling all over,
<pb n="3" facs="13"/>
like cream when it's skimming. Why, sir, says I, her father unluckily died, just before the Duke his brother, and so could not leave her one shilling of all that fine fortune; so my Lord intends to marry her to Mr. Woodville, says I.—"He does? cries he; heav'n be prais'd I'm come in time to mar that dainty project, however. You may go, woman, and tell Miss, I don't want any thing more to-night."—So up goes I to Miss Mortimer, and tells her all this. Lord! how glad she was, to find he intended to break the match, tho' she can't guess what he means.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vane.</speaker>
<p>Upon my soul, I think, it is full as hard to guess what she means. What the devil, will not my Lord's title, fortune, and only son, be a great catch for a girl without a friend or a shilling?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<p>Ay; but I could tell you a little story, would explain all.—You must know,
<stage>(sitting down; a loud knocking.)</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>You are welcome to England, brother! I am sorry your native air pays you so ill a compliment after sixteen years absence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>'Faith, my Lord, and so am I too, I promise you: I put up with these things tolerably well in the Indies; I did not go there to be happy; but,
<pb n="4" facs="14"/>
after all my labours, to find I have just got the money when it is out of my power to enjoy it, is a cursed stroke:—like a fine ship of war, I am only come home to be dismasted and converted into an hospital. However, I am glad <hi>you</hi> hold it better: I don't think you look'd as well when we parted. My sister, poor Susan! she is gone too:—well, we can never live a day the longer for thinking on't. Where's Frank? is he still the image of his mother?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Just as you left him, but that the innocence of the boy is dignified by the knowledge of the man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>He will hardly remember his old uncle!—I did love the rogue, that's the truth on't; and never look'd at my money-bags but I thought of him. However, you have provided him a wife?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>I have; you saw her on your arrival, I suppose, for I left her in town to attend a sick aunt. Poor Mortimer!—he died one month before the Duke his brother, and missed a fine title and estate. You know how I loved the honest fellow, and cannot wonder I took home his orphan'd daughter, as a match for Woodville.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Brother, brother! you are too generous; it is your foible, and artful people know how to convert it to their own advantage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>It is, if a foible, the noblest incident to humanity. Sophia has birth, merit, accomplishments; and wants nothing but money to qualify her for any rank.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Can she have a worse want on earth? Birth, merit, accomplishments, are the very things that render money more essential: if she had been brought up in a decent plain way indeed,—but she has the airs of a peeress already; and, if any philosopher doubts of the perpetual motion, I would advise him to watch the knocker of your house. Then you have, out of your precise decorums, removed your son, to make way for this flirt of fashion; and what is the consequence of rendering him thus early his own master?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>If you run on thus, only to divert yourself, with all my heart; but, if you would throw a real imputation on Miss Mortimer's conduct, she is entitled to my serious defence. I never saw any good arise from secluding young people; and authorise Woodville and Sophia to live with that innocent elegance, which renders ev'ry rank easy, and prevents pleasure from seducing the heart, or ignorance the senses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>My Lord, I am amazed at you! was there ever yet a woman who didn't mean to pass for a goddess? Do they not gain upon us continually, 'till nothing of our prerogative remains but the name? We are wise fellows truly, if we do not keep down this humour of theirs as long as possible, by breeding them in retirement. Every tinsel fop will find address enough to convince wife she is an angel; and the husband must be lucky, as well as sensible, who reconciles her to treatment so inferior to her deserts. Woodville will agree with me, I dare say; for the character suits with his intended; and, 'faith, he will
<pb n="6" facs="16"/>
make but a modish husband, or he could not endure to see her flying about, like the queen-bee with the whole hive at her heels.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>You are too captious, brother!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>And you too placid, brother! if, like me, you had been toiling a third of your days to compass a favourite design, and found it disappointed at the moment you thought it complete, what would even your serene Lordship say and do?—here have I promised myself a son in yours,—an heir in yours;—instead of which,—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>His marriage with Miss Mortimer will not make him unworthy either title.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Never mention her name to me, I beg, my Lord!—I hate all mode-mongers of either sex: the wife, I would have given him, has beauty without knowing it, innocence without knowing it, because she knows nothing else, and to surprize you further forty thousand pounds without knowing it—nay, to bring all your surprizes together, is my daughter without knowing it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Your daughter? why have you married since my sister's death? your daughter by <hi>her,</hi> you lost before you went abroad.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but I shall find her again I believe—I know you will call this one of my odd whims as usual, but we all have some, witness this dainty project of yours; and so I will tell you the truth in spite of that project.—from the very birth of this girl, I saw her mother would spoil her, and, had she liv'd, proposed kidnapping Miss in her infancy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="17"/>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Kidnap your own daughter!—why brother I need only prove this to obtain a commission of lunacy, and shut you up for life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Why, tho' my wife was your Lordship's sister, I will venture to tell you she was plaguy fantastical, and contriv'd to torment me as much with her <hi>virtues,</hi> as others by their <hi>vices</hi>—such a fuss about her <hi>delicacy,</hi> her <hi>sensibility,</hi> and her <hi>refinement,</hi> that I could neither look nor speak, without offending one or the other; and execrated the inventor of the jargon ev'ry hour in the four and twenty: a jargon, I resolved my girl should never learn; and heav'n no sooner took her mother, heaven be praised for all things, than I dispatch'd her draggle-tailed French governess; made a bonfire of ev'ry book on education; whip'd Miss into a post-chaise (under a pretence of placing her in a nunnery) instead of which, I journey'd into Wales and left her under the care of a poor curate's wife, whose name was up as the best housewife in the whole country; then return'd, with a solemn history of her death in the small-pox.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Well, this is indeed astonishing! an admirable tutoress truly for my niece!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but there's a better jest than that—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!—Is that possible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>How do you think I contrived to <hi>make</hi> them obey my instructions?—I saw they suspected I was some rich humorist, and was afraid they would, after all, make a little bit of a gentlewoman of her, for which reason, except the first year in advance, they never had a single shilling of my money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="18"/>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>This is almost incredible! and so you left your only child to the charity of strangers?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>No, no, not so bad as that neither.—You remember my honest servant, Hardy? after the poor fellow's leg was shot off in my tent, I promis'd him a maintenance; so entrusting him with the secret, order'd him to live in the neighbourhood, have an eye on the girl, and claim her if ill-used:—fine accounts I had from him, 'faith! the old parson and his wife, having no children, and not finding any one own her, gave out she was <hi>theirs,</hi> and doated on her; in short, she is the little wonder of the country; tall as the palm-tree! with cheeks, that might shame the drawing-room; and eyes, will dim the diamonds I have brought over to adorn them.—This confounded gout has kept me in continual alarm, or else she should have spoke for herself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Why then does not Hardy bring her up to you?</p>
</sp>

<p>Why for two very sufficient reasons:—in the first place, that identical parson paid him the last compliment, that is, buried him, a twelvemonth ago; and in the second, they would hardly entrust her to any man but him who deliver'd her to them.—Here was a girl, my Lord, to support your title, of which I dare swear you are as fond as ever: she would have brought you a race of true Britons; instead of which, from the painted dolls and unjointed Macaronies of these days, we shall produce our own enemies, and have a race of Frenchmen born in England.</p>

<p>I thank your <hi>intention,</hi> brother; but am far from wishing the chief accomplishments of Woodville's Lady should be the making <hi>cream cheeses, goats whey,</hi> and <hi>alder wine.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Let me tell your Lordship, women were never better than when those <hi>were</hi> their chief accomplishments.—But I may be ridiculous my own way, without being singular.—<hi>Harcourt</hi> shall have my girl, and my money too.—Cream cheeses, quotha? no, no, making cream <hi>faces</hi> is an accomplishment which the belles of these days oftener excel in.</p>

<p>Nay, I must e'en take an old man's fate, and follow his mistress without complaint.</p>

<p>You have no reason for the reproach; this is not his hour for visiting Miss Mortimer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Miss Mortimer!—ha, ha, ha! why, do you think I took <hi>her</hi> for his mistress?—what, I warrant, I can tell you news of your own family, though I have hardly been three days in it?—Woodville keeps a girl, and in great splendor!—nay, they tell me, that the unconscionable young rogue encroaches so far on the privileges of threescore, as to intend marrying the slut.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>You jest surely?</p>

<p>There's no jest like a true one,—ha, ha, ha, how foolish you look!—this is your <hi>innocent elegance!</hi>

<p>Pr'ythee reserve your raillery, sir, for some less interesting occasion;—to have my views thus in a moment overturned,—where does she live?</p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha!—oh, the difference of those little syllables <hi>me</hi> and <hi>thee!</hi> now you can guess what made me so peevish, I suppose?—as to where Miss lives, I have not heard; but somewhere near <hi>his</hi> lodgings.—A devilish fine girl she is, by the bye.—Ah, I told you, twenty years ago, you would spoil this boy,—entirely spoil him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! Governor, you have a temper Socrates himself could not have supported;—is this a time for old sayings of twenty years ago?—finish dressing;—by that time your nephew will be here, and I shall have reflected on this matter.</p>

<p>Never, my Lord.</p>

<p>Not that he keeps a mistress?—what does the fool smile at?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vane.</speaker>
<p>I did not think that any thing important, my Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>I do, sir—and am told a <hi>more</hi> important thing: that he even thinks of marrying her;—now, though I cannot credit this, I would chuse to know what kind of creature she is;—could not you assume a clownish disguise, and, scraping an acquaintance with her people, learn something of her character and designs?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vane.</speaker>
<p>Doubtless, to oblige your Lordship, <hi>I could</hi> do such a thing.—But, if Mr. Woodville's sharp eyes (and love will render them still sharper) should discover me, I might chance to get a good drubbing in the character of a spy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Oh, it is very improbable he should suspect you:—at the worst, name your employer, and your bones are safe.—The office perhaps is not very agreeable, but I impose few such on you: execute it well, and you shall remember it with pleasure.—I will detain Woodville 'till you are ready; and, as I doubt not that his next visit will be to this

creature; by following him, you will find out where she lives. Prepare then as quick as possible, and send me word when you are ready; for, 'till then, I will not suffer him to depart.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vane.</speaker>
<p>A pretty errand this his formal Lordship has honor'd me with!—um;—if I <hi>betray</hi> him, shall I not get more by it?—ay, but our heir is such a sentimental spark, that, when his turn was serv'd, he might betray <hi>me.</hi> Were he one of your hare-um scare-um, good-natur'd, good-for-nothing fellows, it would go against my conscience to do him an ill turn.—I believe, I stand well in my Lord's will, if Counsellor Puzzle may be trusted, (and, when he can get nothing by a lye, perhaps he may tell truth) so, like all thriving men, I will be honest because it best serves my interest.

<p>Well; all the philosophers (ancient and modern) would never be able to convince me, a coach was not a mighty pretty vehicle; and the lasses as good-natur'd in town as country: but pray let us know, why you laid aside the pastoral project of eating fat bacon and exercising a crook all day, that thou might'st conclude the evening with the superlative indulgence of a peat-fire and a bed stuft with straw?</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>I dread much more to hear you have lost yourself—Ah, my dear Woodville! the most dangerous charm of love is, ev'ry man conceits no other ever found out his method of loving: but, take my word for it, your Dolly may be brought back to a Milkmaid.—Leave her to herself awhile, and she'll drop the celestials, I dare swear.</p>

<p>A fine scheme truly! why, Woodville, ar't frantic?—To predestinate yourself among the horned cattle of Doctors Commons, and take a wife for the very reason which makes so many spend thousands to get rid of one—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>To withdraw an amiable creature from her duty, without being able to make her happy is to me a very serious reflection;—nay, I sinned, I may say, from <hi>virtue:</hi> and, had I been a less grateful son, might have call'd myself a faultless lover.</p>

<p>Well, well, man! you are young enough to trust to time, and he does wonders.—Don't go now and ruin yourself with your uncle;—I have found him out already, and advertise you, none of your formal obsequious bows and respectful assents will do with him; having been cheated in former times of half his fortune by a parasite, he mistrusts ev'ry one, and always mistakes politeness for servility.

<p>LORD help us! how fantastical some folks not a hundred miles off are!

<p>Oh la, ma'am! how should you know 'till you try? Sure ev'ry body must wish to see and be seen.

<p>La, ma'am, don't ye talk so purphanely!—happy, to be old and ugly?—or, I'll tell you what, as you don't much seem to fancy going out, suppose you were to come down now and then (you know we have a pure large hall) and take a game of romps with <hi>us?</hi> If you were once to see our Jacob hunt the slipper, you would die with laughing! Madam Frisk (my last mistress) used, as soon as ever master was gone, (and indeed he did not trouble her much with his company) to run down, draw up her brocaded niggle-de-gee, and fall to play at some good fun or other:—dear heart! we were as merry then as the day was long; I am sure I have never been half so happy since.</p>

<p>I don't love to go much among the mobility neither.

<p>Will you never be above so narrow a prejudice? are we not the whole world to each other?—nay, dry your tears! allow me to dry them;
<stage>(kisses her cheek)</stage>
what is there, in the reach of love or wealth, I have not sought to make you happy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>That which is the essence of all enjoyments,—innocence:—oh, Woodville, you knew not the value of the heart, whose peace you have destroyed.—My sensibility first ruined my virtue, and then my repose.—But, though for you I consented to abandon an humble happy home, to embitter the age of my venerable father, and bear the contempt of the world, I can never support my own.—My heart revolts against my situation, and hourly bids me renounce a splendor, which only renders guilt more despicable.

<p>I am obliged to you, sir, for the question; but who is it has made me thus destitute?—I may retain your protection, indeed, but at what a price!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Give me but a little time, my love!—I am equally perplexed between my father and my uncle; each of whom offers me a wife I can never love. Suffer them to defeat each other's schemes!—let me, if possible, be happy without a crime; for I must think it one, to grieve a parent hitherto so indulgent.—I will not put any thing in competition with your peace; and long for the hour when the errors of the lover will be absorb'd in the merits of the husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>No, Woodville! that was, when innocent, as far above my hopes, as it is now beyond my wishes.—I love you too sincerely to reap any advantage from so generous an error; yet you at once flatter and wound my heart, in allowing me worthy such a distinction: but love cannot subsist without esteem; and how should I possess yours when I have lost even my own?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="23" facs="33"/>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>It is impossible you should ever lose either, while so deserving both.—I shall not be so easily denied hereafter, but am bound by the caprices of others at present.—I am obliged to return directly, but will hasten to you the very first moment;—when we meet again, it must be with a smile, remember.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>It will, when we meet again.—Oh how those words oppress me!
<stage>(aside)</stage>
but do not regulate your conduct by mine, nor make me an argument with yourself, for disobeying my Lord; for here I solemnly swear never to accept you without the jointconsent of both our fathers; and that I consider as an eternal abjuration:—but, may the favor'd woman you are to make happy, have all my love without my weakness!
<stage>Exit in tears.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Disinterested, exalted girl!—why add such a needless bar? for is it possible to gain my father's consent? and yet, without her, life would be insupportable:—the censures of the world,—what is that world to me?—were I weak enough to sacrifice her to the erroneous judgment of the malicious and unfeeling, what does it offer to reward me?—commendations I can never deserve, and riches I can never enjoy.

"Being certainly inform'd Mr. Woodville is on the point of marrying a Lady chosen by his friends, when it is presumed you will be disengaged, a nobleman of rank, and estate above what <hi>he</hi> can ever possess, is thus early in laying his heart and fortune at your feet, lest some more lucky rival should anticipate him.—The bearer is authorised to disclose all particulars, and offer you a settlement worthy your acceptance.—Deign, madam, to listen to him on the subject, and you will find the unknown lover as generous and not less constant than Woodville."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>Good heaven's! to what an insult have I expos'd myself!
<stage>[<hi>She bursts into tears, and sinks into a chair, without minding</hi> Harcourt; <hi>who watches her with irresolution.</hi>]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>What can I think?—there is an air of injured delicacy in her, which teaches me to reproach myself for a well-meant deceit.—If, madam,—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="41"/>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>I had forgot this wretch.
<stage>(Rises)</stage>
Return, sir, to your vile employer; tell him, whoever he is, I am too sensible of the insult, tho' not entitled to resent it—tell him, I have a heart above my situation, and that he has only had the barbarous satisfaction of adding another misery to those which almost overwhelmed me before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Hear me, madam!—I conjure you!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible <hi>he</hi> should be so cruel, so unjust—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>He is neither cruel nor unjust, but only unfortunate.—Hear—he designs to marry you; this I learnt from himself only this morning. As a proof of my sincerity, I will own I doubted your right to that mark, of his esteem, and made this trial in consequence. Pleas'd to find you worthy of his rank, I feel shock'd at reminding you, you ought not to share it. But, madam, if you truly love him, you cannot wish that, to be just to you, he should be unjust to those who have a prior right over him.—This shall positively be my last effort.
<stage>(Aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>A motive like your's, sir, will excuse any thing. How little my happiness, honour, or interest, <hi>ever</hi> weighed against his, need not be repeated. Far be it from me <hi>now</hi> to disgrace him; he is apprized of my invincible objections to a match which will never
<pb n="32" facs="42"/>
take place. May he form a happier, while I by a voluntary poverty expiate my offence!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Ma—Ma—what the devil choaks me so?—I am struck with your sentiments, and must find you a proper asylum. The moment I saw you, I had hopes such manners could not veil an immoral heart. I have proved your sincerity, and owe a reparation to your delicacy. The proposed bride of Woodville is every way worthy that distinction; nor am I without hopes even <hi>she</hi> will be prevailed on to protect you.—But I must not leave a doubt of my sincerity:—do you know Miss Mortimer?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>I have seen the lady, sir. But dare I credit my senses?—has heav'n form'd two such hearts, and for me?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>With her, your story will be buried for ever: and, I think, the sooner you disappear, the more easily will you prevent Woodville's disobedience. I will open the affair to Miss Mortimer directly, and, if she acquiesces, desire her to call for you in person, to prevent the possibility of any artifice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>He, who inspired such sentiments, alone can reward them! Oh, sir! you have raised a poor desponding heart; but it shall be the business of my future life to deserve those favours I can never half repay.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>I find, by punishing me with acknowledgments, you are resolved to be obliged to me. The time is too precious to be wasted on such trifles. At seven, you shall have certain intelligence of my sucsuccess:

<p>A benevolence you certainly doubt, by this studied eulogium.</p>

<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>You may laugh, madam, but I am serious; and a fine girl she is: and to shew you I have not read Chesterfield in vain, I have robb'd my dearest friend of her; in plain English, Woodville has a mistress he doats on so madly, as even to intend marrying her.—Imagining her, like most of her stamp, only an artful and interested creature, I paid her a visit as a stranger, with an offer which must have unveil'd her heart, had it been base:—but I found her, on the contrary, a truly noble-minded girl, and far above her present situation; which she earnestly wishes to quit.—In short, my dear, I thought it prudent to part them; and, in your name, offered her an asylum.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M. Mor.</speaker>
<p>In my name? You amaze me, Mr. Harcourt! Would you associate your wife with a kept mistress? bring such an acquisition into the house of Lord Glenmore, and deprive Woodville of perhaps his only reason for not interfering with us?—Do you think I credit this <hi>sudden</hi> acquaintance?</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I can make distinctions more clearly than you wished. You must excuse my interference in this affair, sir; and let me hint to you, that your own will do as little credit to your heart as to your understanding.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>It is that cruel argument perpetuates error in so many of your frail sex: be the first to rise above it. That you are in Lord Glenmore's house, will be your justification, both to the world and himself: for, what but the design of serving him and his son can actuate you? In my eyes, my dear Sophia, virtue never looks so lovely as when she stretches out her hand to the fallen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M. Mor.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Harcourt! I am ashamed of my suspicion: I ought to have known all the candour and generosity of your heart, and received in a moment the unhappy woman it patronized:—yet, at this crisis, in our own affairs to run the chance of further exasperating my benefactor—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>I am not to learn, that friendship and love have been mere masks to fraud and folly in the great world; no one would blame me, were I to suffer Woodville to ruin himself, as the shortest way of fixing my own fortune, and obtaining my Lord's approbation of your choice. But, I know not how it happened, that, when a mere boy, I took it into my head, truth was as much to the purpose as lying; and, as I never got into more scrapes than others, why I still pursue my system, and prefer honour to art. Then, if we fail, we have something better to console us than a pond or a pistol; and, if we succeed, what is there wanting to our happiness?</p>

<p>And how do you mean to manage her escape?</p>

<p>Very well; we must carefully watch our opportunity. You dine here—the <hi>word</hi> of command you are accustomed to obey, but you must now become obedient to the <hi>look</hi>; for, you know, I have my difficulties, however strong my desire of obliging you.</p>

<p>Only a formal round, my Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Woodville, you attend Miss Mortimer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M. Mor.</speaker>
<p>Sweetly contrived that, however, and my lover seems posed.
<stage><hi>(Aside to</hi> Harcourt)</stage>
—I will not so severely tax Mr. Woodville's politeness, my Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>You are very obliging, madam;
<stage>(<hi>to</hi> Harcourt)</stage>
and the only thing she has said or done to oblige me this day, entre nous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage>
Um, not quite sure of that, if you knew all—
<stage>(<hi>turning to Miss</hi> Mortimer)</stage>
—I will march off quietly, and lie in wait for Woodville, so that I think you may depend on his not meeting you.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Goes off unobserved.</stage>
<stage>Woodville, <hi>having taken his hat and sword, offers his hand to Miss</hi> Mortimer.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>So, he is going to escape! They all take pleasure in perplexing me. Frank, return to me directly;
<pb n="41" facs="51"/>
I have bethought myself of something very important, in which I need your assistance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Would I had bethought myself of vanishing, like Harcourt! How devilishly vexatious!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Leads Miss</hi> Mortimer <hi>off.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>So, there goes madam, to coquette, curtsy, and talk nonsense with every well-dressed ape of either sex. Before I would allow a girl such a freedom—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Brother! do not judge 'till you know her! and give me leave to tell you, these prejudices of your temper will render you very ridiculous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>The prejudices of my temper! Oh Lord, Oh Lord! this is an excellent jest. Zounds, because you have not the use of your eyes—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>I shall never have patience. My head is just now full of something too important, to examine which of us is most in the wrong. I am fixed on removing this ambitious minx of my son's for ever out his reach immediately. Will you oblige me with the company of your servants? Being slaves, they will not dare reveal the affair; and, were they so inclined, can hardly comprehend it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Will I? ay, that I will; and with my own company into the bargain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Hist! he returns: and, if we may judge by his countenance, mortified enough, to lose the evening away from her.
<stage><hi>Re-enter</hi> Woodville.</stage>
Go, my dear Frank, first to Puzzle's chambers; for
<pb n="42" facs="52"/>
the mortgage of Hayfield house, and don't fail to learn his whole opinion upon the subject;
<stage>(<hi>aside to the</hi> Governor)</stage>
and that will take two long hours by a very moderate computation:—then proceed to the London Tavern, and ask if Levi, the Jew, waits there by my appointment? otherwise do <hi>you</hi> wait there 'till either he or I join you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>A pretty round-about employment my father has invented for me!
<stage>(aside)</stage>
and I dare not give the least symptoms of disgust, lest that troublesome old uncle of mine should pry into the cause. I shall observe your orders, my Lord—though, if the devil has called upon the counsellor a little before his time, I shall consider it as an eternal obligation.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Now I must enquire after Vane.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>And I will give a little lecture to my myrmidons, and wait with them your pleasure. Od, it will be precious sport, to catch madam so unawares, and see her play off every virtuous grimace with which she entangled young 'Seapegrace.

<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>What,—silent, man?—ha, ha, ha! I can't but laugh to think how foolish you look'd at the second year's end, when no allowance came,—but that was my own contrivance: all done on purpose, my good old soul! and now it will come in a lump; there's the whole difference.—Well, and so my dame made her a pattern of housewifery, hey?—od! I don't intend to touch another pickle or preserve that is not of my little Cicely's own doing; and I'll build her a dairy with ev'ry bowl and churn of silver!—zounds, it shall be a finer sight than the Tower of London!—
<pb n="45" facs="55"/>
and we'll set up dame Deborah's statue before it, like Queen Ann's in St. Paul's Church-yard!—but, why dost'nt enjoy this discov'ry, man? art afraid I shall take her from thee? oh, never think of that; for thou shalt bless ev'ry pye she makes; ay, and <hi>taste</hi> it afterwards, Old Pudding-Sleeves.</p>

<p>None, that I know of; but your whole fraternity are not more like ravens in colour than note;—come, let us know what this mighty evil is?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>For years did she increase in goodness as in beauty; the charm of ev'ry young heart, and the sole comfort of those old ones, to whom heav'n and man seem'd to have consign'd her for ever.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Well, well; I had a little bird told me all this—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>About a twelvemonth ago, during a little absence of mine, a young man of fashion introduced himself into my house; and, my wife being void of suspicion, and the dear girl uninstructed in the ways of this bad world,—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="46" facs="56"/>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>The dog betray'd her?—and is this your care, you old—and that ignoramus, your wife—zounds! I am in such a fury!—I want to know no more of her infamous conduct.—Od! I am strangely tempted to have you strangled this moment, as a just reward for your negligence; and so bury the secret with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>It is as effectually buried already, Sir.—I love the dear unhappy girl too well, ever to tell her heav'n gave her to such a father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes;—you are better suited to the—I hope she pays for this severely!—you make her stand in a white sheet, to be pointed at by the whole village ev'ry Sunday, to be sure?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>Alas, Sir, she put it out of my power even to forgive her.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Forgive her! forgive her truly!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>By flying immediately from her only friend.—infirm and poor, I struggled with the joint-evils till now; when, having collected enough to support me, I walk'd up in search of her:—it was only yesterday I discover'd her in a splendid coach, which I traced to her house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>A <hi>house,</hi> I shall run mad entirely—a <hi>coach?</hi>—why dare the little brazen-face pretend to elegance, when I took such pains to quench ev'ry spark of gentility in her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>In the nighbourhood I discover'd the name of her seducer; and, in seeking him, met with you.—Moderate your passion, Sir,—reflect! when age is frail, what can we expect in youth?—shall man desert humanity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="47" facs="57"/>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>So, so, so; now I am to be tortur'd with your preaching.—I renounce the unworthy little slut.—I have no friend,—no daughter,—no any thing;—od! I would sooner build an hospital for ideots, like Swift, and endow it with all my fortune, than bestow it on one who thus perverts reason:—hark ye, Sir,—forget the way to this house I—forget you ever saw my face!—would I had never seen your's!—for, if you dare to send her whining to me, I'll torment you with ev'ry plague, power, wealth, law, or even lawyers can set in motion—by heav'n, I abjure the audacious little wretch for ever! and will sooner return to India and bury my gold with those from whom it was taken, than bestow a single shilling on her, when she loses her <hi>coach</hi> and her <hi>house.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Contemptuously)</stage>
And I will sooner want a a shilling, than suffer her to waste her youth in a state which will render her age an unsupportable burden. Fear not, Sir, ever seeing <hi>her</hi> or <hi>me</hi> again; for the bosom which rear'd will joyfully receive her, nor further embitter her remaining days with the knowledge she was born the equal of her undoer; and depriv'd herself of all those blessings heav'n only <hi>hid,</hi> never denied her.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>

<p>Who would have a daughter?—zounds! I am as hot as if I was in the black hole at <hi>Calcutta.</hi>—If miss had only married a lout, from ignorance of her birth, I could have forgiven it; but, her puppy being
<pb n="48" facs="58"/>
of fashion, the papers will get hold of it, and I shall be paragraphed into purgatory.—Fools can turn wits on these occasions; and "a certain Governor and his daughter," will set the grinners in motion from Piccadilly to Aldgate.—This insolent old fellow too!—I need not wonder where she got courage!—not but I like his spirit,—od! I like it much!—it proves his innocence.—What the devil did I drive him away for?—here, dogs! run after that old man in black, and order him to return to me this moment.</p>

<p>—Bridget! what's become of your Lady?</p>

<p>Really, Sir, I can't say;—don't you know?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>If I did I shou'd n't have ask'd you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p><stage>(After a little pause)</stage>
Why, sure Sir, my Lady has not run away? and yet something runs in my head, as if she had.—I thought that spark came for no good to-day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>What spark, girl?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Why, just after you went away, comes a young man, a monstrous genteel one and very handsome
<pb n="53" facs="63"/>
too, I must needs say; with fine dark eyes and a fresh colour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Damn his colour! tell me his business.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>So he axed for my Lady, and would not tell <hi>me</hi> what he wanted: I came with her, however, but she no sooner set eyes on him than she sent me out; which argufy'd no good, you'll say; and, before I could possibly come back, though I ran as fast as ever my legs could carry me, he was gone, and she writing and crying for dear life;—but that was no news, so I did not mind it: and, when she gave me leave to go to the play, thought no more harm than the child unborn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>It must be a scheme beyond all doubt, and I am the dupe of a dissembling, ungrateful—oh Cecilia!

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Softening her voice and setting her dress)</stage>
If I was as you, Sir, I would not fret about her:—there is not a lady in the land would slight a gentleman so handsome and sweet temper'd—I scorns to flatter, for my part.—Inferials must'nt direct their betters: but, had I been in my Lady's place, a King upon his throne would not have tempted me.—Handsome him that handsome does, say I; and I am sure you did handsome by her; for, if she could have eat gold, she might have had it.—He might take some notice truly</p>

<p>This ridiculous love turns peoples brains, I think.—I am sure, I said enough to open his eyes:—but, maybe, I don't look so handsome, because I am not so fine.—Hey,—a thought strikes me! my Lady is gone, that's plain.—Back she will not come, is as plain.

<p>Cruel, ungrateful, barbarous girl!—to forsake me in the very moment I was resolving to sacrifice ev'ry thing to her!—but 'tis just.—First dupes to the arts of man, the pupil soon knows how to foil him at his own weapons.—Perhaps the discov'ry is fortunate.

<p>My Leady, her own zelf; and I'll tell you how 'tware.—After dinner I geed her a noate; and, when zhe had red un, zhe axed me if zo be as how I ever zeed the lions? zoa I told her noa; nor nomour I never did.—Zoa zhe geed me half a crown, and bid me goa and make myself happy. I thought it ware desprate koind of her; zoa I went and zeed the huge creturs; and ater, only stop'd a bit to peap at the moniment, and hay my fortin tould by Conj'rer in the Old Bailey; and aw zaid—</p>

This fellow can never mean to impose on me, and I must think this a plann'd affair'—While I was in the country, Jacob, did your mistress see much company?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jac.</speaker>
<p>Cuompany?—noa, not to speak of,—not gentlewomen.</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Jac.</speaker>
<p>Oh yes, zur, yes—two gentlemen com'd almost ev'ry deay.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Why, I believe the impudent bumpkin dares to jest with my misery! and yet I have no other avenue: for the rest, I fear, are knaves, and he seems only a fool—and are these all that came, Jacob?</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Jac.</speaker>
<p>Noa, there ware one moare, zur; a leetle mon in a black quoat,—but he only com'd now and tan.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>A disguise, no doubt? Yes, yes, they were artful enough.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes; Mrs. Bridget was in all her secrets, I don't doubt. If that fellow in black comes here again, keep him, if you value your life, and send for me. I know not what to do or think, and must renew my search, tho' hopeless of success.

<p>Dang it! but he's in a desprate teaking!—Rabbit me, but I ware muortally afeard aw un too, for aw flourish'd his zword as yeazy as I could a cudgel:—and I do think conj'urer might as well ha tuold me madam would ha' run away, while aw ware about it, and then I moight ha' run away furst.

<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>At length I have gained entrance into the house of shame, which now, alas! contains my darling Cecilia,—plung'd in vice, and lost to every sentiment, I spent so many anxious years in implanting. This does not seem to be the abode of pleasure, nor have I met a single being.</p>

<p>Ha! a man! and in black, as Jacob said! Villain, this moment is your last.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p><stage>(turning suddenly upon him)</stage>
Yes, young seducer, add to the daughter's ruin the father's murder! Stab my heart, as you already have my happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Alas, was <hi>this</hi> her visitor? I dare not speak to him!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>Embosomed by affluence, exalted by title, peace still shall be far from thy heart; for thou, with the worst kind of avarice, hast by specious pretences wrested from poverty its last dear possession,—virtue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Plerced to the soul, as I am by your reproaches, I dare appeal to Cecilia herself for a testimony of my contrition! How shall I convince you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>Hardly by a life of repentance. But I debase myself to exchange a word with you. Give me back my Cecilia!—Ruin'd as she is, I yet would recover her:—give her back then to a father you first taught her to fear, and an habitation, too humble for any but the good to be happy in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Alas, Sir! can you trifle with my misery? do <hi>you</hi> give her back to the wretch who cannot survive her loss!—let me owe her hand to your bounty, tho' her heart to her own!—did you know what this elopement of her's has cost me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>Oh, most accomplish'd villain!—but think not to dupe <hi>me</hi> too.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="70"/>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Who but you can have robb'd me of her since morning?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>Shallow artifice!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Hear me, Sir! and even believe me, when I solemnly swear I have deeply repented my crime, and offer'd her all the reparation in my power;—but, since then—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>What since then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Either by your means, or some other, she has fled!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>Impossible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Tis too true, by heav'n!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps, while you are thus ingeniously deluding me, she <hi>indeed</hi> flies.—Study some other deception, while I examine the whole house, for nothing else can convince me.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Woodville</speaker>
<stage>alone.</stage>
<p>Surely this injur'd venerable man was sent by heav'n to complete my misfortunes!—my passions subside, but only into a vague horror and despondency, even more dreadful:—if with rash hands she has shorten'd her days, what remains of mine will be, indeed, all her father predicts!
<stage>(walking by the toilette)</stage>

</sp>
<stage><hi>Re-enter</hi> Grey.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>A total loneliness in the house!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Now, sir, be convinced!—I have just found a letter from her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="61" facs="71"/>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>This cannot be the invention of a moment:—let me read it—it is, indeed, her hand.
<stage>(Opens, and reads it)</stage></p>
<p>Receive this as my last farewel.—Providence has unexpectedly sent me a friend, whose protection I dare accept; and time may perhaps subdue a passion, which seems interwoven with my being.—forget me, I intreat; and seek that happiness with another, I can never hope to bestow or partake.—Consoled only by reflecting, that the grief, my error occasions, is inferior to that I should have felt, had I, by an ungenerous use of my power, made you, in turn, my victim.—Once more, adieu!—all search will certainly be fruitless.<lb/>
P. S. In the cabinet you will find your valuable presents; and the key is in a dressing-box.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Woodville <hi>snatches the letter, and bursts into tears</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>Cecilia! I may say, with tears of joy, thou art, indeed, my daughter! more dear (if possible) than ever! a daughter monarchs might contend for, though thy weak father abjures thee!—may the friend you have found have a heart but like your own! for you, young man!—but I leave you to your anguish; the loss of <hi>such</hi> a woman is a sufficient punishment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Stay, sir!
<stage>(rises)</stage>
by your holy profession, I conjure you, stay!—plunge me not into total despair!—though without a clue to her asylum, I would fain believe my heart will lead me to it; and let me then hope you will bestow her on me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="62" facs="72"/>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>There is a something in your manner, young gentleman, that affects me;—I have been young, wild, and extravagant myself; and, what is more strange, have not forgot I was so: my own experience proves reformation possible; act up to her, and atone your error.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>I will endeavour it, sir! and, oh could those who yet but waver, feel what has passed in my heart, during the last hour, who would dare to deviate?

<p>SO,—I am ready against our gentleman comes.—Deuce on him to run away last night, the moment I was drest—and with an inferial fellow too!—Lard, how can people of quality demean themselves by keeping company with inferials!—however, one thing I am sure of, he's too much on the fidgets to stay long away from our house; and, in the mean while, I can entertain myself extremely well.

<p>Dear heart!—I am all of a twitteration!—who can these be?—that's my Lord, for certain!</p>

<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>The vulgarity of the wench is astonishing!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>—Um—why, a little gawky, or so,—there's no denying it.—
<stage>(aside)</stage>
Here's a pretty discovery, now, after all my projects!—thank fortune, the secret is yet my own though.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Advancing to her)</stage>
I ought to beg your excuse, madam, for so abrupt an intrusion; but the opportunity and so fair a temptation will, I flatter myself, be a sufficient apology.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage>
He takes me for my lady, that's a sure thing!—oh, this is charming!—you need not make no 'poligy's, my Lord;—inferials never knows how to suspect people of quality; but I understands good breeding better.</p>

Why, what a Barn-door Mawkin it is! your politeness, madam, can only be equalled by your beauty.</p>

<p>I was afraid, madam, I should prove an unwelcome guest;—but beauty, like yours—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Does your Lordship think I so very handsome,

then?—Lord, how lucky was my dressing myself!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside)</stage>
Affected ideot!—I was afraid, Madam, too of meeting Woodville here—
<stage>(aside)</stage>
I know not what to say to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>He has not been here this morning; but, if he had, he knows better than to ax ater my company, I do assure you, my—Lordship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>I have been told he intends marrying you; what a pity to monopolize such merit!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>If he has any such kind intention, 'tis more than I knows of, I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>His keeping that wise resolution from you, is some little comfort, however.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>But, I promise ye, I shall make a rare person of quality—for I loves cards, coaches, dancing, and dress, to my very heart;—nothing in the world better—but Blindman's Buff. I had some thoughts of taking a trip to Sadler's Wells or Fox Hall, but they don't begin till five o'clock.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside)</stage>
Ha, ha! tho' she can hardly spell out the Ten Commandments, she cou'd break every one with as much ease and impudence, as if she had been bred in the circle of St. James's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>But, Madam, you know, allowing Woodville willing to marry you, it is not in his power while his father lives, without forfeiting his fortune, the value of which you doubtless understand?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, yes, for sartain, my Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Who knows too, how far an incensed parent may carry his resentment!—he might find means to entrap and punish you.</p>

<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!—he entrap me!—that <hi>would</hi> be a good jest!—no, no, I have more of the lady of quality than to be so easily caught.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p><stage>(mimicking her)</stage>
He, he, he! that is the only particular in which you have nothing at all of the lady of quality.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>With me you may share a higher rank and larger fortune without those fears—<hi>I</hi> am of an age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Yes, one may see that without being a conjuror—why, will you marry me, my Lord?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Convince me that you don't love this Woodville, and I know not how far my passion may carry me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Love him? do you think I know no more of high life than that comes to?—To be sure, he is a sweet pretty man, and all that;—but, as to love,—I loves nobody half so well as myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Upon my soul, I believe you; and wish he had the whole benefit of the declaration:
<stage>[to the Governor]</stage>
her ingratitude is as shocking as her ignorance, and Bridewell too gentle a punishment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Then build a bridewell large enough to contain the whole sex; for the only diff'rence between her and the rest is,—this Country Mawkin <hi>tells</hi> what the Town-bred Misses <hi>conceal.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Why, Governor! you are as testy as if you had had the care of <hi>her</hi> education.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>I the care?—zounds, what I say is merely from friendship to your Lordship.—I hate to see you deceive yourself.—

<p>What, when I am a Lady?—oh, I'll venture that, and attend you.</p>

<p>Dear heart! be ye indeed?—what will become of me then?</p>

<p>And, as a moderate punishment for your hypocrisy, ambition, and ingratitude, sentence you to be shut up for life in a monastery.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>What, where they'll cut off my hair, and make me wear sackcloth next to my skin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Yes, if they leave you any skin at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear, dear, dear!
<stage>(sobs and groans)</stage>
upon my bended knees, I do beg you won't send me there!—why I shall go mallancholly—I shall make away with myself for certain; and my ghost will appear to you all in white!</p>

<p>All in black, I rather think; for the devil a speck of white is there in your whole composition.</p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha! very prettily devis'd, faith, for a young beginner!—come, come,

we must give you credit for this, Miss—<hi>your Lady?</hi> ha, ha,—ha!</p>

Vane, is all ready?—seize this woman, and observe my orders!</p>

<p>Ah dear heart! I shall die away if the blacks do but touch me—indeed you do mistake!—I be no Lady—I be only Bridget.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>I would give ten thousand pounds that you <hi>were</hi> only Bridget, you artful puss!—Zounds, tho' I could one moment strangle the pug's face in her own necklace, yet the next I can hardly prevail on myself to punish her—what the devil had I <hi>now</hi> to do in England? or what the devil had I <hi>ever</hi> to do in Wales?—Phew! I could dethrone fifty Nabobs without half the fatigue and anxiety of this moment.—Take her away, however! and let us try how Miss likes riding out in her <hi>own coach.</hi></p>

<p>You see, madam, you have only to retire to engage us to pursue you, even to rudeness.—But, tell me, can it be your own choice to punish us so far as to prefer solitude to our society?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>I know myself too well, my Lord, to receive distinctions of which I am unworthy;—yet think not, therefore, I fail in respect.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>But, is that charming bosom susceptible of nothing beyond respect? why is it capable of inspiring a passion it cannot participate?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>Your goodness, my Lord—my profound veneration, will always attend you—but, the more generously you are inclined to forget what is due to yourself, the more strongly it is impressed on my memory.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Were what you say true, the bounties of nature atone amply to you for the parsimony of fortune; nor would your want of every other advantage lessen your merit, or my sense of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage>
Had he thought thus a few months since, how happy had I now been!—Your approbation at once flatters and serves me, by justifying Miss Mortimer's protection of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Her partiality for you, does her more honour, than it can ever do you advantage. But, you must tell me, how she gain'd first the happiness of knowing you?</p>

<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>My—my Lord, by a misfortune so touching—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I would not distress you neither; yet, I own, madam, I wish to make a proposal worth a serious answer; but ought first to know, why you affect a mystery? Tell me then, my dear, ev'ry incident of your life, and I will raise you to a title, I may without vanity say, many have aspired to!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>You oppress my very soul, my Lord! But, alas! unconquerable obstacles deprive me for ever of that title. Neither <hi>would</hi> I obtain it by alienating such a son from such a father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Put him entirely out of the question; the meanness of his conduct acquits me to myself. Do you know, madam, he has resolved to marry a creature of low birth, illiterate, vulgar, and impudent? and, to complete her perfections, she has been <hi>his</hi> mistress at least.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>Surely he knows, and purposely shocks me thus.
<stage>(Aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>But your integrity doesn't render you less amiable in my eyes; it greatly enhances ev'ry other merit. As to his wretch, I have her in my power, and shall make her dearly repent.</p>

Oh, nothing more easy, madam; I had him carefully traced to her house; and, during his absence, took servants and forced her away.</p>
</sp>

That, however, cannot be me; every word seems to add to a mystery I dare not enquire into.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>But why waste one precious moment on such an animal? what are these unconquerable obstacles?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>Spare me, my Lord; your indulgence induces me to try again to soften your resolutions respecting your son: deprived of the weak, the guilty, the miserable wretch you justly condemn, a little time will (no doubt) incline him to his duty. I should have your pardon to solicit, my Lord, but that your own openness authorizes mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>But, can you, who so powerfully plead the cause of another, be deaf to the sighs of a man who adores you? who offers you a rank—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>Be satisfied, my Lord, with knowing I have all that esteem your merit claims; which influences <hi>me</hi> beyond every casual advantage.</p>

<p>But, madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>Alas, my Lord!—

more whimsical than—even myself.—Yesterday you would have the puss spite of ev'ry body; but, you no sooner find it in your power to oblige your bestfriend, by humouring your inclinations, than, lo! you are taken with a most violent sit of duty and submission!—Od, you don't know what you have lost by it!—but, since you are bent on crossing me, I'll cross you, and once for all too.—My secret shall henceforth be as impenetrable as the philosopher's stone.—Ay, stare as you please, I'll give you more years than you have yet seen days to guess it in.

<p>Ha, ha, ha! my future father-in-law seems to have got a quietus of my intended; and, faith, so wou'd any man who was not in love with a certain forty thousand;—to be sure, in plain English, she is a glorious mawkin!—
<stage>(to her)</stage>
—well, madam, how are you pleas'd with your present mode of living?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Living, do you call it?—I think, 'tis only starving.—Why, I shall eat my way thro' the walls very shortly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<p>Faith, Miss, they use you but so so, that's the truth on't; and I must repeat, even to your face, what I said to my Lord, that your youth, beauty, and accomplishments, deserve a better fate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Dear heart! Bedlam, did I say, I was in! why, I never knew a more sensibler, genteeler, prettier sort of a man in my life.

—I am sure, Sir, if I was to study seven years, I shou'd never know what I have done to discommode them, not I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<p>Oh Lard, my dear! only what is done ev'ry day by half your sex without punishment—however, you are to suffer for all, it seems?—you see your fare for life!—a dungeon, coarse rags, and the same handsome allowance of bread and water twice a day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Oh, dear me!—why, I shall be an otomy in a week!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>

<p>Why, sure they will let you come and see me, Sir? I shall certainly swound away, ev'ry time I look at the nasty old black.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<p>This is the last time your dungeon (which your presence renders a palace to me) will ever be open to one visitor—unless—unless—I cou'd contrive—but no, it would be my ruin:—yet who woud'nt venture something for such a charming creature? you could endear even ruin.—Tell me, then, what reward you would bestow on a man who ventur'd all to give you freedom?</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I don't know; you're such a dear sweet kind soul, I shan't stand with you for a trifle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<p>Ahey! Miss will be as much too complying in a minute.—Well, then, my dear! I must marry you, or you will still be in the power of your enemies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brid.</speaker>
<p>Hey?—what? do I hear rightly? marry me?—
<stage>(aside)</stage>

The only amends you can make me, is by dying—and now, my dear! I will own to you, I have the license in my pocket; and my Lord, as eager as myself.—Our chaplain will do us the favour with more expedition than he says grace before meat!—Well done, Vane! egad, thy lucky star predominates!—

<speaker>M. Mor.</speaker>
<p>Woodville is now with his father, and both in the decisive mood.—Oh, Charles! as the moment approaches nearer, your influence becomes insensibly less powerful:—the frantic fits of the Governor; the solemn absurdity of my Lord—but, above all, the behaviour of Woodville, hurts and alarms me!—still cautious not to offend his father, he has tried ev'ry way to extort the refusal from me; but, by a pardonable equivocation, I left him hopeless, and assured him I should, to the utmost of my power, obey my benefactor.—Why, why did you marry one, who could give you nothing but her heart?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>I shall not answer, till you can name me an equivalent—trust to my management, my dear Sophia.—I still flatter myself, one storm will settle the tenor of our lives—if not; while acquitted to Heav'n, the world, and ourselves, we may struggle with spirit against fortune; and sometimes owe our dearest enjoyments to her fluctuations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M. Mor.</speaker>
<p>By sentiments like these you won my very soul; and to retain for ever a heart so invaluable, I have ventur'd the displeasure of my benefactor: but our hearts will not always follow the lead of our reason, nor, when I consider the cause, can I repent the deviation of mine.</p>

<speaker>M. Mor.</speaker>
<p>So, you leave me out of the plot?—well, if it ends happily, I shall be contented; and, like the world, measuring your merit by your success, will declare you a most inimitable schemer.—Adieu!</p>

<p>Without this proof of your obedience, all you can urge, Sir, is ineffectual.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>While obedience was possible, I never swerv'd, my Lord; but, when you command me to make myself wretched, a superior duty cancels that:—already bound by a voluntary, an everlasting vow, I cannot break it without offending heav'n, nor keep it without offending you.</p>

<p>Did you once know the incomparable merits of my love, even your Lordship's prejudices must give way to your reason.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Mere dotage.—But, had she more than any one woman ever yet possess'd, doesn't her conduct equally evince her folly and depravity?</p>

<p>Oh, your conscience may be very easy on that account; it could not require much art to deceive such an ideot.</p>

<p>No, no, my Lord; why paint the devil blacker than he is? not an ideot neither.</p>

<p>Sir, my father's freedom of speech I must endure;—but yours—</p>

<p>You must endure too, young Sir, or I shall bite my tongue off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>But, my Lord! that dear unhappy girl is no longer a subject of debate,—she evidently proves her merit by her flight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Would you make a virtue from not doing ill, when it is no longer in your power?—Woodville! I was once weak enough to believe indulgence the surest way of obtaining your duty and esteem.—My eyes are at last opened,—Miss Mortimer is worthy a better husband; but you are her's, or no son of mine.—I solemnly promised this to her dying father, and will acquit myself at all events.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Can you resolve to sacrifice me to a promise made before we could judge of each other?—You never felt, Sir, the compulsion you practice;—will you dissolve the first band of morality, and see your highly-estimated title end in me? for never will I on these terms continue it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>I almost wish <hi>I</hi> never had continued it.—
<stage>(Walks in anger.).</stage>
I am determined, Woodville! and nothing but Miss Mortimer's refusal can break the match.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>I shall not put that in her power, my Lord? Permit me to tell you, no son was ever more sensible of a father's kindness: but, if I can purchase its continuance only with my honour and my happiness, it would be too dearly bought.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>'Tis well, sir.—I have listened to you sufficiently. Now hear ME. Know, this worthless wretch, you prefer to your duty, is in my power; nay, in this house.</p>

The devil she is! how in the name of ill-luck should he find that out?—my fine scheme entirely blown up, by Jupiter!</p>

<p>Why play thus upon me, my Lord?—her letter—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>What, has she wrote to you?—that I was not aware of, nor indeed suspected she could write.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>No, not so ignorant as that neither. I order'd she should write too!</p>

<p>Zounds! nobody knows his <hi>own</hi> part in your family, that I see! and this fellow, too, to teize me, whom I lov'd above all in it Why, I spoke entirely from regard to him. If, since then I have discovered

a bumpkin was beforehand with him in the possession of his miss—</p>

<p>And, had I ten millions of money, and this only girl, thou should'st have her, and that, too, for thy noble freedom.—And what says my Cecilia to her father's first gift?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>Astonishment and pleasure leave me hardly power to say, that a disobedience to you, sir, would only double my fault: nor to worship that Heav'n, which has led me through such a trial to such a reward!—take all I have left myself to give you, Woodville, in my hand—
<stage>(Woodville <hi>kisses first her hand, and then herself</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>Now, let me die, my darling child! since I have seen thee, once more, innocent and happy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>And now, kiss me, my Cecilia!—kiss me!—od, Miss Mortimer shall kiss me too, for loving my poor girl here!—kiss me, all of you, old and young!—men, women and children!—od, I am so overjoy'd, I dread the consequences.—D'ye hear, there?—fetch me a surgeon and a bottle of wine!—I must both empty and fill my veins on this occasion—zooks, I could find in my heart to frisk it merrily in defiance of the gout, and take that cursed vixen below, whoever she is, for my partner!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>Methinks all seem rewarded, but my poor Sophia here? and her protection of Cecilia deserves the highest recompence: but whenever, my dear, you can present me the husband of your choice, I will present him with a fortune fit for my daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Protect Cecilia! od! she is a good girl, and a charming girl, and I honour the very tip of her feathers now!—if she could but fancy our Charles,
<pb n="98" facs="108"/>
I'd throw in something pretty on his side, I promise you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Mor.</speaker>
<p>Frankness is the fashion.—What would you say, Sir, and you, my Lord, if I <hi>had</hi> fancied your Charles so much, as to make him mine already?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Hey day! more discov'ries! how's this, boy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Even so, Sir, indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
<p>It completes my satisfaction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gov.</speaker>
<p>Od, brother! who'd have thought you in the right all the while—we'll never separate again, by the Lord Harry! but knock down our Welch friend's old house; and raise him one on the ruins, large enough to contain the whole family of us, where he shall reign sole sov'reign over all our future little Woodvilles and Cecilias.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cec.</speaker>
<p>Oppressed with wonder, pleasure, gratitude, I must endeavour to forgive <hi>myself,</hi> when heav'n thus graciously proves its forgiveness, in allying me to ev'ry human being my heart distinguishes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grey.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my Cecilia, you may believe <hi>him,</hi> who never gave you a bad lesson, that you are now most truly entitled to esteem; since it requires a far greater exertion to stop your course down the hill of vice, than to toil slowly up toward virtue.</p>
