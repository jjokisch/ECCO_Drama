<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>IT were an Imposition on the Town, and an Injustice to the Memory of the inimitable <hi>BEN JOHNSON;</hi> should I publish this Play, without acknowledging that most part of the Plot, some of the Scenes, and many of the Speeches, are almost literally copied from a dramatic Work of his, with the same Title. An Attempt at altering a Piece of his, is, I believe, unprecedented, and indeed bold, for one who never before, either burthen'd the Press with his Labours, or dar'd the Critic's Censure. I was allur'd to the Task, by a Number of very noble Sentiments, which are scattered through the Original in many Lines, neither harsh or unmusical; wherein there seems to breath the true inspir'd Spirit of Poetry; and fancy plays within her proper Sphere, under the Restraint of a well temper'd critical Judgment; but much more by the strong Contrast of virtuous and vicious Characters, with which I found it adorn'd; which is the most useful, laudable, and consequently the fundamental Part of the <hi>DRAMA.</hi></p>
<p><pb n="vi" facs="5"/>
To reduce the Multiplicity of Characters, the Train of Incidents, to make the Parts of <hi>LIVIA,</hi> and <hi>AGRIPPINA,</hi> somewhat interesting, which in <hi>JOHNSON</hi> are very near despicable; to select his Beauties, and by proper Means to bring about the Catastrophe; seem'd, at first, an Enterprize as difficult, as toiling for Wealth in a Mine; and almost startled me from my Design; But however, as I had begun, I determined to proceed; and of my Success, the Perusal of the Piece will make you a Judge.</p>
<p><hi>JOHNSON</hi>'s strict Adherence to History, in his two Plays of <hi>SEJANUS</hi> and <hi>Catiline,</hi> would have been highly commendable, had it not been manifestly prejudicial to him; since he has been so scholastically nice, as scarcely to omit a single Person or Incident, mention'd in the Lives of these <hi>great wicked</hi> Men; nay he has even translated literally, in his <hi>SEJANUS,</hi> several Lines from <hi>CORNELIUS TACITUS:</hi> By this Means his Tragedies became rather dramatic Histories, than Entertainments suited to a modern Theatre. From this I have ventur'd to deviate; I have kept <hi>CAESAR</hi> at <hi>ROME,</hi> to preside at the Conviction of <hi>SEJANUS;</hi> as I think it adds much Spirit, to the closing the Catastrophe; I have drawn him of a Disposition much milder than he was in Reality. The pious Resolution of repealing the Oppressions, and healing the constitutional Wounds made by <hi>SEJANUS,</hi> which I have put into his Mouth, in the last Speech of the Play, I thought necessary
<pb n="vii" facs="6"/>
to preserve <hi>Poetical Justice;</hi> to which I think History should give Way; for the real Use of dramatic Performances is, to instil Virtue, and raise an Abhorrence of Vice. Example is a strong Argument; nothing conduces so much to our Reformation, as punishing the Wicked and rewarding the Virtuous, 'tis then that the Moral is truly strong, indeed the Guiltless must sometimes fall, to heighten the Distress, and impress us with a just Pity.</p>
<p>If these Liberties should to the Critics appear Errors, I honestly confess them Errors of my Judgment; and for my Confession expect to be mildly treated. By the Critics, I would be understood to mean only the judicious, not such teizing Insects, such buzzing Drones of Society, as those at present distinguish'd by that Name.</p>
<l>Who fret and strut their Hour upon the Stage,</l>
<l>And then are heard no more.</l>
<bibl>SHAKESPEARE.</bibl>
<l>Each Wight who reads not, and but scans and spell,</l>
<l>Each Word-catcher that lives on Syllables.</l>
<bibl>POPE.</bibl>
<p>From such I neither wish or expect Indulgence, let them be ridiculous at my Expence, if they please; my Pity they may move, but not my Anger. From the Penetration of the Judicious, I shall be glad to meet Correction, their Clemency I doubt not, for still like the Brave, they chuse rather to spare than destroy. My
<pb n="viii" facs="7"/>
asserting that I had a <hi>national Advantage in View,</hi> in this Subject may be thought chimerical, at first, but when the following Abstract from History, of the Life of <hi>SEJANUS,</hi> is considered, what I have advanced may perhaps be allowed.</p>
<p><hi>AELIUS SEJANUS</hi> the Son of <hi>SEIUS STRABO</hi> was born in <hi>TUSCANY.</hi> He served, when young, with some Reputation, under <hi>CAIUS CAESAR,</hi> Nephew to <hi>AUGUSTUS,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi>Praetorian Band</hi> under the Command of <hi>TIBERIUS;</hi> to the various Turns of whose Disposition by conforming, he gradually crept into his closest Secrets, and was the first in his Esteem. When <hi>TIBERIUS</hi> mounted the Imperial Throne, he allowed this his favourite, such an Extent of Power, as rendered him the Terror of honest Men, and the Idol of Sycophants. The taking off <hi>GERMANICUS,</hi> Husband to the <hi>AGRIPPINA,</hi> who is introduced in this Play, and Nephew to the Emperor, a Prince remarkable for the greatest Virtues, though the Odium of it was artfully flung on <hi>GNEIUS PISO, GERMANICUS</hi>'s Lieutenant, was generally and justly attributed to him: This was his first close Attack upon the <hi>LIBERTY</hi> of <hi>ROME,</hi> and procured him the Hatred of the People. After this by the Means of <hi>LIVIA,</hi> Wife to <hi>DRUSUS, EUDEMUS</hi> her Physician, and <hi>Lygdus</hi> an Eunuch, who was <hi>SEJANUS</hi>'s <hi>CATAMITE,</hi> he contrived and effected the Death of <hi>DRUSUS,</hi> Son to <hi>TIBERIUS,</hi> and Heir apparent to the Empire. The
<pb n="ix" facs="8"/>
Reason assigned for his Hatred, was a Blow which <hi>DRUSUS</hi> one Day gave him; but his future Proceedings shewed, Ambition, not Revenge, was the Motive which urg'd to the Deed; for he had determin'd to remove every Bar, which lay between him and the Throne. This was but a Prelude to his future Villainies. <hi>AGRIPPINA,</hi> her Sons, and all who were Friends to the <hi>Family</hi> of the dead <hi>GERMANICUS,</hi> were next to be disposed of. This was effected by representing them to <hi>CAESAR,</hi> who was naturally of a <hi>jealous</hi> Disposition, as aspiring and ambitious, and consequently dangerous. <hi>CAIUS SILIUS</hi> was first mark'd out for Sacrifice; who being, before the Senate, criminated by <hi>VARRO</hi> the Consul, and finding his Death had been premeditately resolved on; by a voluntary Wound anticipated a public Execution.</p>
<p><hi>SABINUS,</hi> another Adherent to the Family of <hi>GERMANICUS,</hi> was next taken off, by the Means of <hi>LATIARIS,</hi> his Relation and profess'd Friend: who having often, with much seeming Sincerity, rail'd at the Oppressions and Tyranny of <hi>SEJANUS,</hi> and thus, by touching him,
<l>Ev'n on the tend'rest Point, the Master String</l>
<l>Which <hi>made</hi> most Harmony, or Discord in him.</l>
<bibl>ROWE.</bibl>
Having wrought him up to join in his Invectives, He fix'd two <hi>Senators,</hi> who were <hi>Creatures</hi> to
<pb n="x" facs="9"/>
<hi>SEJANUS,</hi> in a secret Place, whence they might overhear the Discourse between <hi>SABINUS</hi> and him; who, on his too freely censuring the Conduct of <hi>CAESAR,</hi> rush'd from their Ambush, accused him of Treason, and after a formal Process, he was, by Death, eased of the Pains which he endured, for the Sufferings of his Country.</p>
<p><hi>SEJANUS</hi> next, with the Concurrence of <hi>TIBERIUS,</hi> removed <hi>AGRIPPINA</hi> and her <hi>Sons,</hi> so that he had none now left to oppose his Interest with <hi>CAESAR,</hi> or Designs upon the <hi>Throne.</hi> Her he had banish'd to <hi>PANDATERIA</hi> an <hi>Island</hi> in the <hi>TYRRHENE</hi> Sea, <hi>NERO</hi> to the Island of <hi>PONTIA</hi> near <hi>NAPLES,</hi> and <hi>DRUSUS</hi> confined in the most abject Part of the Palace.</p>
<p>Being thus successful in all his Schemes, what he aimed at became more and more apparent. To facilitate his Designs on the <hi>EMPEROR,</hi> he endeavoured to demean him in the Opinion of the People, by ridiculing his Defects and Imperfections on the <hi>public Theatre.</hi> This first induced <hi>CAESAR</hi> to examine more nearly into his Conduct; and he soon found it was absolutely necessary for his own Safety, to hurl this <hi>COLOSSUS</hi> of the <hi>ROMAN STATE,</hi> suddenly down the Steep of Fate. To effect this appeared scarcely practicable, since he feared the Fall of this stupendous Pile, would drag down with it contiguous Ruin, in which he himself might be involved. However he at
<pb n="xi" facs="10"/>
last compassed this coveted end, by the Assistance of <hi>MACRO,</hi> and a Shew of encreasing Friendship and Trust, which rendered <hi>SEJANUS</hi> still more secure, when his Glory was on the Verge of expiring: He was, when even such an Attempt must have seem'd impossible, accused by a Letter from <hi>TIBERIUS</hi> then in <hi>CAPREA,</hi> supported by Proofs in full <hi>Senate,</hi> of the most flagitious Crimes; condemned with Ignominy, and to the unexpected Joy and Surprize of every <hi>honest Roman,</hi> precipitated from the topmost Height of <hi>Fortune</hi> to the lowest Depth of <hi>Adversity</hi> and a shameful Death. It is generally and justly remarked, that the <hi>Sunshine</hi> of Prosperity animates a Number of buzzing Flies, who disappear with its <hi>Decline.</hi> The Truth of this Observation was never more apparent than in the Case of <hi>SEJANUS,</hi> for not one of the Number of <hi>Sycophants</hi> and <hi>Dependants,</hi> who had been the Instruments of his villanies, and who held large Fortunes and Titles from his Bounty, offered to defend him at his Fall, or even wore the Face of Concern; nay so far from it, they were his most sanguine Enemies, and hurried him onward to his Fate.</p>
<p><hi>SEJANUS</hi> seemed to have been mark'd out by Providence as an Example to Futurity, of that Justice which will at one Time or other overtake the <hi>Great bad Man</hi> who uses his Power to oppress, or to curtail the <hi>Liberties</hi> of his <hi>Country.</hi> And were this his History
<pb n="xii" facs="11"/>
to be performed either publicly or privately for <hi>ministerial Amusement,</hi> an excellent and persuasive Instruction must ensue from it.</p>
<p>The same Soil which was blessed with a <hi>BRUTUS,</hi> a <hi>CATO</hi> and a <hi>GERMANICUS,</hi> was cursed with a <hi>SEJANUS: BRITAIN</hi> who feels herself happy in an <hi>ORRERY,</hi> a <hi>CHESTERFIELD,</hi> and had in the Person of her late generally and justly lamented <hi>PRINCE</hi> of <hi>WALES,</hi> all that <hi>ROME</hi> boasted in her <hi>GERMANICUS,</hi> knows not what <hi>SEJANUS</hi> may rise in future Times to wound her Peace.</p>
<p>Business detaining me in the Country, I requested my Friend Mr. <hi>DERRICK</hi> to present this Play to Mr. <hi>GARRICK,</hi> which he accordingly did, and was promised by him an Answer in four or five Days. Mr. <hi>DERRICK</hi> waited on him again about that Time, when with a <hi>Punctuality,</hi> which is not at all answerable to the Character generally given of <hi>theatrical Managers,</hi> he returned the Piece with some Compliments as to its Merits, alledging, that it had too much Declamation in it, to succeed on the <hi>Stage;</hi> and I am induced to believe, that though this <hi>Play</hi> was not introduced to Mr. <hi>GARRICK</hi> under any <hi>particular prevailing Influence,</hi> he took the Trouble to peruse it, and on that alone founded his Answer.</p>
<p><pb n="xiii" facs="12"/>
However I suppose you expect to find me severe on the Manager, for presuming to repulse my Offspring; but you are mistaken; I am ever ready to <hi>receive,</hi> and thankful <hi>for</hi> Instruction. It being an approved Maxim with me, that <hi>Approbation is very pleasing; but Correction more profitable;</hi> and therefore say with <hi>SHAKESPEARE</hi>'s <hi>BRUTUS,</hi> though more in earnest,<l>I shall be glad to learn of able Men.</l><bibl>SHAKESPEARE.</bibl></p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>WHEN Vice corrupts and cankers in a State,</l>
<l>It surely brings, tho' slow, the Frowns of Fate.</l>
<l>When plodding Ministers by wicked Arts,</l>
<l>Can blind the Eyes, and rule a People's Hearts;</l>
<l>Then Tyranny and Faction rage around,</l>
<l>And lawless Acts eternally abound.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The Nation groans beneath indignant Chains,</l>
<l>Where proud ambitious Statesmen hold the Reins.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Such was SEJANUS, such he flourish'd long,</l>
<l>For Patriot Opposition much too strong.</l>
<l>By direst Means and Artifice he rose,</l>
<l>And step'd tow'rds Empire on the Necks of Foes.</l>
<l>No Honesty before his Pow'r could stand,</l>
<l>Poor harass'd Virtue fled the suff'ring Land;</l>
<l>Wounded, she labour'd for a safe Retreat,</l>
<l>And weeping Blood forsook her ancient Seat:</l>
<l>While Vice, in all the Pomp and Pow'r of Pride,</l>
<l>Did at ROME's venerable State preside.</l>
<l>Yet tho' thus deck'd, with most alluring Charms,</l>
<l>Who would not fly to banish'd Virtue's Arms?</l>
<l>Titles like Bubbles that on Waters play,</l>
<l>Are by a Breath both rais'd and puff'd away,</l>
<l>'Tis Virtue that alone feels no Decay.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb n="xv" facs="14"/>
<l>She gives her Proselytes a lasting Store;</l>
<l>Beyond the Worth of sordid glitt'ring Ore;</l>
<l>Her Joys are of a higher nobler Bent,</l>
<l>They balm the Mind, administring Content.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus much it necessary seem'd to say,</l>
<l>Concerning the chief Purport of the Play.</l>
<l>And now a second Charge I must fulfill,</l>
<l>Our Author, Alterer, or what you will,</l>
<l>Humbly requests the Critics may be still.</l>
<l>Not that he fears;—the snarling Train he slights,</l>
<l>For under JOHNSON's laurell'd Shade he writes.</l>
<l>If you will damn, he says, his Fall is great,</l>
<l>Since honest BEN must e'en participate,</l>
<l>And so ally'd he dares the Frowns of Fate.</l>

<l>'Tis true: A Court of Vice is not our Sphere.</l>
<l>We want the glossy Arts and thriving Use,</l>
<l>Should make us share the Sun-shine of this Place:</l>
<l>Which is the Soil of Flatt'ry and Deceit.</l>
<l>It is a Garden full of baneful Herbs,</l>

<l>We have no Change of Faces, no cleft Tongues,</l>
<l>No soft and glutinous Bodies, that can stick</l>
<l>Like Snails on painted Walls, or on our Breasts</l>
<l>Creep up, to fall from that proud Height, to which</l>
<l>We did by Slavery not Service climb.</l>
<l>We burn with no black Secrets, that can make</l>
<l>Us dear to the pale Authors, or live fear'd</l>
<l>Of their still waking Jealousy, to raise</l>
<l>Ourselves a Fortune by subverting theirs.</l>

And PINNARIUS NATTA, two of the servile Herd,</l>

<l>Know more than honest Councils; whose Breasts</l>
<l>Were they rip'd up to Light, would plain appear,</l>
<l>The gloomy Cabinets of ev'ry Vice.</l>
<l>It is a simple Sin, to which their Trunks</l>
<l>Have not been made the Organs; they can lie,</l>
<l>Smile and betray, impeach the guiltless Man;</l>
<l>Sell to their Suitors, (shallow grapling Fools,)</l>
<l>The empty Smoak that flies about the Palace.</l>
<l>Laugh when their Patron laughs, frown as he frowns,</l>
<l>Change every Mood as often as he varies—</l>
<l>Gods! are these Men? Suffer ye Slaves like these,</l>
<l>To take your own great Likeness on themselves,</l>
<l>And act such Baseness in a human Shape!</l>
<l>Why are they not distinguish'd by a Form,</l>
<l>Vile and abhorred as their treach'rous Souls?</l>
<l>Then Honesty might seek a different Clime,</l>

<l>Of <hi>Senators,</hi> so worthy is our State,</l>
<l>Start up in public Council, and there strive,</l>
<l>Who shall propose most abject things and base.</l>
<l>So much, that even TIBERIUS hath been heard,</l>
<l>Leaving the Court, to cry, "Oh Race of Men</l>
<l>"Prepar'd for Servitude"—Why ev'n he,</l>
<l>Who least the public Liberty should like,</l>

<l>Well, we deserve it all, nay and much more;</l>
<l>Who with our Riots, Pride and Civil Hate,</l>
<l>Have so provok'd the Vengeance of the Gods.</l>
<l>We who within these fourscore Years were born</l>
<l>Free, equal Lords of the subjected World,</l>
<l>And knew no Masters but Affections:</l>
<l>To which, betraying first our Liberties,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Seja.</speaker>
<l>PHysician, thou art worthy of an Empire,</l>
<l>For the great Service done unto our Loves,</l>
<l>And but that fairest LIVIA, bears a Part</l>
<l>In the Requital of thy Faith and Care,</l>
<l>I should despair of having Means or Pow'r,</l>
<l>To make thy Friendship ample Recompence.</l>

<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="29"/>
<speaker>Livi.</speaker>
<l>EUDEMUS, I will see it, shall receive</l>
<l>A fit and full Reward, for his large Merit,</l>
<l>In gaining me the great SEJANUS Love.</l>
<l>Which more than tributary Worlds I prize.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seja.</speaker>
<l>Thou brightest Object of my panting Heart,</l>
<l>Thou Joy and Source of ev'ry pleasing Thought;</l>
<l>Not Glory, Fame, or ought on Earth to me,</l>
<l>Can hold a Balance equal to thy Love.</l>
<l>By Heav'n I ne'er knew Transport till this Hour;</l>
<l>My Days have all been idly spent till now.</l>
<l>Like one without the Use of precious Sight,</l>
<l>Long have I stumbled thro' a gloomy Shade;</l>
<l>But now thy Day breaks in upon my Soul,</l>
<l>The Clouds disperse and all around is bright.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Livi.</speaker>
<l>How pleasing is the Sound of soothing Words,</l>
<l>From the dear Object of one's tender Love.</l>
<l>But will this ardent Passion ne'er expire;</l>
<l>Can'st thou transgress the Rule of all thy Sex,</l>
<l>So constant prove to keep thy promis'd Faith,</l>
<l>Nor slight Possession of a doating Fool?</l>
<l>Oh! should'st thou negligently fly my Arms,</l>
<l>Should in thy Breast the Flame of Love expire,</l>
<l>Life would no longer then be worth my Care.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seja.</speaker>
<l>Do not my Eyes unfold my inmost Thoughts,</l>
<l>Do they not speak thee Empress of my Soul?</l>
<l>Oh! beauteous Princess, whose transcendent Form</l>
<l>Strikes with Astonishment each wond'ring Eye.</l>
<l>And like the SUN great Nature's Source of Life,</l>
<l>Indulgent Beams to gladden all around.</l>
<l>How dark is all, when thou art from my Eyes?</l>
<l>How tedious Time when thou art from my Arms?</l>
<l>With thee he leaves his Instruments of Flight,</l>
<l>Nor seems to move, when uninspir'd by thee.</l>
<l>Then if in Absence I do ever mourn,</l>
<l>Nor taste of Comfort but when thou art nigh,</l>
<l>Thou need'st not sure suspect declining Love?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Livi.</speaker>
<l>Think if I fear 'tis only for thy Sake,</l>
<l>So much thou art the God of my Desires,</l>
<l><pb n="15" facs="30"/>
So much the Joy and Comfort of my Life,</l>
<l>So much the Object of my hourly Thoughts,</l>
<l>That I would grudge ev'n Heav'n it's Part of thee,</l>
<l>And have thee hail no other Shrine but Love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seja.</speaker>
<l>It is too much, by all the Pow'rs I swear,</l>
<l>Empires are poor to such Expence of Love,</l>
<l>Nor can a Mortal the large Boon repay.</l>
<l>Nay it would task the mighty Pow'r of Gods,</l>
<l>To give a Blessing of an equal Worth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Livi.</speaker>
<l>Had lov'd SEJANUS been my wedded Lord,</l>
<l>Then had my Hours in Joys transporting pass'd.</l>
<l>But cruel Fate ran counter to my Will,</l>
<l>Join'd me to one, who never shar'd my Heart,</l>
<l>For it has ever waited upon thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seja.</speaker>
<l>Why here thou speak'st the Malice of our Fate;</l>
<l>Oh! Gentle Love, were but one Bar remov'd,</l>
<l>The Road to perfect Happiness is plain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Livi.</speaker>
<l>DRUSUS I know thou mean'st, and much I wish,</l>
<l>For thy dear Sake, he now surviv'd no more.</l>
<l>He is thy Enemy, a deadly Foe.</l>
<l>Yet more; should he e'er note our secret Loves,</l>
<l>What sure Destruction must that Period bring?</l>
<l>Heav'ns how I tremble at the rising Thought,</l>
<l>It strikes a Terror to my shiv'ring Heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seja.</speaker>
<l>One Way there is quite open to Repose;</l>
<l>If thou dost hold SEJANUS in thy Love,</l>
<l>Nay if thy Life or Peace be worth thy Care,</l>
<l>Thou wilt adventure what I shall propose.</l>
<l>Thou hast the Pow'r, the Means to fix our Peace,</l>
<l>And bid Defiance to the Frowns of Fate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Livi.</speaker>
<l>If I have Pow'r, then Safety is our own.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seja.</speaker>
<l>List then to what Precaution does advise.</l>
<l>In DRUSUS' Death alone our Fears can end.</l>
<l>EUDEMUS shall prepare a potent Draught,</l>
<l>Which thou with Care must mix in DRUSUS Cup:</l>
<l>'Twill give quick Passage to his fleeting Soul,</l>
<l>And we shall taste uninterrupted Joys.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Livi.</speaker>
<l>Yet think a little, I'm his wedded Wife,</l>
<l><pb n="16" facs="31"/>
And tho' he stands not fix'd in my Esteem,</l>
<l>I should not be the Minister of Fate.</l>
<l>'Tis barbarous, nay terrible to think,</l>
<l>And makes my Blood run chilly thro' my Veins.</l>
<l>Is there no gentler Means of Safety left,</l>
<l>But must I perpetrate the horrid Act?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seja.</speaker>
<l>Nature commands us to protect ourselves,</l>
<l>Undaunted then th' important Task perform,</l>
<l>Nor let such pallid Fears assail thy Breast,</l>
<l>Think, if once done, 'twill fix thee safely mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Livi.</speaker>
<l>Thy Arguments o'er Nature have prevail'd,</l>
<l>Nor will I live with Happiness in View,</l>
<l>And thro' vain Fears reject the hop'd for Bliss.</l>
<l>Fate shall not bar me from my Wish's Lord.</l>
<l>So to preserve SEJANUS wholly mine,</l>
<l>I will administer the fatal Draught,</l>
<l>The Potion which EUDEMUS shall prepare.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seja.</speaker>
<l>Thou bright and reigning Mistress of my Heart,</l>
<l>So much thy Beauty had enflam'd my Soul,</l>
<l>I thought no Pow'r could have enhanc'd my Zeal.</l>
<l>But now I see your Readiness and Will</l>
<l>To execute the sure and only Means</l>
<l>Will fix thy future Happiness and mine,</l>
<l>I own the Constancy inspires my Breast,</l>
<l>And fires my Heart with yet more ardent Love.</l>
<l>A Spirit so aspiring great as thine,</l>
<l>Was ne'er created for an idle Second,</l>
<l>To DRUSUS' languid Flame,—'twas form'd to shine,</l>
<l>Bright as the Moon among the lesser Lights,</l>
<l>And share the Sov'reignty of all the World.</l>
<l>Then LIVIA triumphs in her proper Sphere,</l>
<l>When she and her SEJANUS, shall divide</l>
<l>The Name of CAESAR, and AUGUSTA's Star</l>
<l>Be dim'd with Glory of a brighter Flame.</l>
<l>When AGRIPPINA's Fires are quite extinct,</l>
<l>And the scarce seen TIBERIUS borrows all</l>
<l>His Light from us, whose folded Arms</l>
<l>Shall make one perfect Orb.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="17" facs="32"/>
<speaker>Livi.</speaker>
<l>My noble Lord,</l>
<l>To fix our Safety calls for utmost Speed;</l>
<l>Therefore we'll haste to banish anxious Fears:</l>
<l>For since it must be done, it should be soon;</l>
<l>While now the total Softness of my Sex,</l>
<l>Is fled far off, on thy Persuasion's Wing.</l>
<l>Farewell, when next we meet, expect with Joy to hear,</l>
<l>That he who bars thy Way to Empire is no more,</l>
<l>Then judge how far I venture for your Sake.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Seja.</speaker>
<l>This one embrace and then, farewell my Love,</l>
<l>Till that blest Hour that makes thee wholly mine,</l>
<l>No perfect Joy can dwell within my Breast.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Livi.</speaker>
<l>I will but change your Words, my Lord farewell.</l>

<l>And mark my Body full of Injuries.</l>
<l>Thou lost'st thyself, Boy DRUSUS, for to think</l>
<l>Thou could'st outstrip my Vengeance, or withstand</l>
<l>The Pow'r I have to crush thee into Air.</l>
<l>Thy Follies now shall feel what kind of Man</l>
<l>They have provok'd, and thy fond Father's House</l>
<l>Crack in the Flame of my incensed Rage;</l>
<l>Whose Fury shall admit no Shame or Mean.</l>
<l>Adultery?—It is the lightest Ill</l>
<l>I will commit. A Race of wicked Acts</l>
<l>(Such as are stil'd so by your virtuous Fools)</l>
<l>Shall flow out of my Anger, and o'erspread</l>
<l>The World's wide Face; which to Posterity</l>
<l>Shall thunder out the mighty Deeds and Daring,</l>
<l>Of great SEJANUS, Fortune's darling Son.</l>
<l>On then my Soul, nor stop thou in thy Course,</l>
<l>Tho' <hi>Heav'n</hi> drop Sulphur, and <hi>Hell</hi> belch out Fire;</l>
<l>Laugh at their idle Terrors; tell proud JOVE,</l>

<l>Will not sit easy with his Death alone.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>If, righteous Heav'n, pure Virtue be thy Care,</l>
<l>Why fell GERMANICUS a Villain's Prey?</l>
<l>Who was a Man of ever spotless Fame,</l>

<l>Nor liv'd to shed so many widow'd Tears;</l>
<l>Nor to behold such harsh Oppressions rise,</l>

<l>Dark lurking Daggers wait for honest Hearts,</l>

<l>Of drawing out the War in GALLIA,</l>
<l>For which thou late did'st triumph, dissembling long</l>
<l>That SACROVIR to be an Enemy,</l>
<l>Only to make thy Entertainment more,</l>
<l>Whilst thou tyrannically poll'd the Province.</l>

<l>WHY are my Thoughts still ministring fresh Pain?</l>
<l>Why are new Cares still rank'ling in my Mind?</l>
<l>Nature aloud calls out for balmy Rest,</l>
<l>But all in vain. My ever waking Soul,</l>
<l>Sits brooding o'er a Train of Images,</l>
<l>That constant rise in terrible Array,</l>
<l>And shrink my Resolution into Fears.</l>
<l>But wherefore should vain Fancies thus appall?</l>
<l>Is not an Empire subject to my Rule?</l>
<l>Have I not all that Fortune could bestow;</l>
<l>In ev'ry Thing but Name, an Emperor!</l>
<l>Is not Ambition glutted with my Store?</l>
<l>And yet that faithful Mirror of the Mind,</l>
<l>Reflection, still a gloomy Prospect shews.</l>
<l>Remorse the <hi>Raven</hi> of a guilty Mind,</l>
<l>Is ever croaking horrid in my Ear;</l>
<l>Often I rouse to banish it away,</l>
<l>But the Tormentor still returns again,</l>
<l>And like PROMETHES' <hi>Vulture,</hi> ever gnaws.</l>
<l>What then is Glory, without soft Repose?</l>
<l>If sweet Content is banish'd from my Soul,</l>
<l>Life grows a Burden, and a Weight of Woe.</l>
<l>Oh! that I could run o'er my Race again,</l>
<l>Then would I chuse to tread the humble Vale,</l>
<l>Nor lab'ring climb up Greatness painful Hill.</l>
<l>But my past Deeds have set me beyond Cure,</l>
<l>And I must still go on or worse endure.</l>
<l>Assist me, Furies, with your hellish Aid,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eud.</speaker>
<l>She says that DRUSUS' Shade appear'd last Night,</l>
<l>And charg'd her all your Actions to reveal;</l>
<l>As some Attonement for her guilty Life.</l>
<l>Possess'd of this she flies o'er all the House,</l>
<l>Crying aloud for Vengeance on SEJANUS.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sej.</speaker>
<l>A Tongue whose Words are of such dire Import,</l>
<l>Should not be suffer'd to have Motion free;</l>
<l>She must be silenc'd or she ruins all.</l>
<l>They shall be try'd, and tho' I loath her Sight,</l>
<l>(So much Enjoyment has pall'd all Desire)</l>
<l>Yet I will speak to her in raptur'd Phrase.</l>
<l>If the dissembl'd Passion can prevail,</l>
<l>No farther we'll proceed—but if it fails,</l>
<l>Then our own Safety loudly claims her Death.</l>

<speaker>Liv.</speaker>
<l>Where is the Monster that ensnar'd my Soul?</l>
<l>Oh thou Fiend of Mankind, most accurst,</l>
<l>Death of my Honour, Instrument of Shame,</l>
<l>How can'st thou stand in open Face of Day?</l>
<l>Thou should'st cohabit with the Gloom of Night,</l>
<l>Emblem and Picture of thy Cloud wrap'd Soul.</l>
<l>Doth not the Sound of Murder haunt thine Ear,</l>
<l>And lawless Love invade thy hellish Heart?</l>
<l>Or can the Fiends, Projectors of thy Deeds,</l>
<l>Afford thee Strength of Mind at all to smile,</l>
<l>And brave the Justice of avenging Heav'n?</l>
<l>Hark! the murder'd DRUSUS calls upon thee,</l>
<l>And groans for Vengeance from the Womb of Earth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="39" facs="54"/>
<speaker>Sej.</speaker>
<l>Does LIVIA then upbraid the Act of Love,</l>
<l>What but thy Beauty could provoke that Deed?</l>
<l>For thee I would have sacrific'd the World,</l>
<l>And with the World have thought thee cheaply won;</l>
<l>That art the Joy and Comfort of my Life.</l>
<l>Imbitter not thy Sweetness with Reproach;</l>
<l>But calm the raging Tempest of thy Soul,</l>
<l>Nor let these phantom Thoughts disturb thy Mind.</l>
<l>Thro' me the God of Love invites to Peace,</l>
<l>And, smiling, gently wooes thee to be blest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Liv.</speaker>
<l>Too well I know thy base designing Heart,</l>
<l>And the dissembling of thy fine spun Phrase,</l>
<l>To fall a second Time thy easy Prey.</l>
<l>I have already lost my Peace of Mind.</l>
<l>Quick crowding Horrors compass me around,</l>
<l>And Life is burthensome with cumbrous Pain.</l>
<l>Reflection makes me curse my natal Hour,</l>
<l>The hallow'd Womb of her who gave me Birth;</l>
<l>The Pow'rs who have permitted me to live,</l>
<l>The Day, the Night, the Race of human Kind,</l>
<l>But chiefly thee, who led me first astray.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sej.</speaker>
<l>Thou could'st not stray and find such ardent Love.</l>
<l>The Gods are envious of our perfect Bliss,</l>
<l>Thinking it more than Mortals should possess</l>
<l>They mingle this Perplexity of Mind,</l>
<l>To disconcert, and bitter all our Joys.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Liv.</speaker>
<l>What Joys? Do any Joys remain in Hell,</l>
<l>Or what's the same, a Croud of guilty Thoughts?</l>
<l>Who can repose upon a Bed of Thorns?</l>
<l>Yet that were Pleasures to the Pangs I feel.</l>
<l>Envelop'd with Despair, I wish to die:</l>
<l>But Conscience whispers to my lab'ring Soul,</l>
<l>I shall not rest from Torture in the Grave;</l>
<l>But find that awful, silent Bed of Death,</l>
<l>The gloomy Mansion of eternal Woe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sej.</speaker>
<l>I'll fondly sooth the Sorrows of thy Breast,</l>
<l>If thou wilt kindly take me for thy Guide,</l>
<l>And shew the Way to Comfort and to Peace:</l>
<l><pb n="40" facs="55"/>
Nor shalt thou labour thro' a thorny Path.</l>
<l>Let not SEJANUS plead his Cause in vain,</l>
<l>But as he claims in thy Affection place,</l>
<l>As thou hast blest him with thy heavenly Charms,</l>
<l>And once did listen mildly to his Vows.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Liv.</speaker>
<l>Blast the Remembrance of the hateful Time,</l>
<l>Oh! that great <hi>Jove</hi> upon that cursed Day,</l>
<l>Wherein I gave up Innocence and Fame,</l>
<l>Had struck me with a Thunderbolt to Earth.</l>
<l>I then had been a Subject of the Grave,</l>
<l>And never known a Guilt so great, so dire.</l>
<l>But wherefore should I thus protract thy Life?</l>
<l>Great CAESAR shall behold thy worthy Deeds,</l>
<l>'Tis he shall thank thee for his murder'd Son.</l>
<l>He shall behold thee in thy proper Light,</l>
<l>Just as thou art, the Serpent of his Blood.</l>

<l>Stay yet a Moment, lovely Princess, stay,</l>
<l>Why would you strive to ruin thus the Man,</l>
<l>That knows no Blessing equal to thy Smiles?</l>
<l>Nay on thy self bring dreadful Ruin down,</l>
<l>For such must wait thy unadvised Tale.</l>
<l>If thou can'st bid me die, then Life farewell,</l>
<l>For all is lost, if I am lost to thee.</l>
<l>Nor would I live to hear thee wish me dead,</l>
<l>Were I convinc'd thy cooler Reason rul'd.</l>
<l>But well I know the Fever of the Mind,</l>
<l>This sudden Gust that irritates thy Soul,</l>
<l>On calm Reflection will abate and cease.</l>
<l>Go in, my Love, enjoy a short Repose,</l>
<l>And lull thy ruffled Thoughts with healing Rest.</l>
<l>I'll bring a Cordial shall compose thy Cares,</l>
<l>And banish all Phantasmas from thy Brain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Liv.</speaker>
<l>I guess the friendly Purpose of your Heart,</l>
<l>And know the healing Balm you have prepar'd.</l>
<l>It is a Med'cine I'd receive with Joy,</l>
<l>If thou wer't not to triumph in my Fall,</l>
<l>And longer live a Burden to the Earth.</l>
<l>Think not thy Cobweb Arts shall now prevail,</l>
<l><pb n="41" facs="56"/>
They are too flimsy to oppose my Rage.</l>
<l>Heav'n is grown weary with thy num'rous Crimes,</l>
<l>Which cry aloud, and bellow for Revenge.</l>
<l>The Arm of Fate now brandishes her Dart,</l>
<l>That is to mark thy Body for the Grave,</l>
<l>And hurl thy impious Soul to blackest Hell.</l>
<l>Then since thy Reign is drawing near a Close,</l>
<l>I will be foremost to compleat thy Fall.</l>
<l>This to my injur'd Husband here I vow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sej.</speaker>
<l>It must be so—I'll stab her treach'rous Heart,</l>
<l>Her Death till proper Time may be conceal'd.</l>
<stage>(Aside.</stage>
<l>Since then relentless Rage thus rules thy Breast,</l>
<l>And thy SEJANUS must a Victim fall,</l>
<l>Give one Embrace to comfort him in Death.</l>
<l>When thou shalt see me in my dying Pangs,</l>
<l>Drop but one Tear in Pity to my Fate,</l>
<l>And that will smooth her most tormenting Frowns.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Liv.</speaker>
<l>If ev'ry Joy were only in my Gift,</l>
<l>I would disperse them among common Slaves,</l>
<l>And lavish them on ev'ry abject Wretch,</l>
<l>E'er give a Grain of Happiness to thee.</l>
<l>Therefore expect the dread Approach of Fate,</l>
<l>When thou wilt curse thy horrid Crimes too late:</l>
<l>When thou shalt be expos'd to public Shame,</l>
<l>And hear the Rabble Crowds revile thy Name.</l>
<l>Blasted by me, thou shalt fall headlong down,</l>
<l>And Tortures meet, for an imperial Crown.</l>
<l>All thy ambitious Hopes in Death shall end,</l>
<l>Without the Comfort of one pitying Friend.</l>
<l>As thou hast ever labour'd to enthral,</l>
<l>And hated liv'd, despis'd by Slaves thou'lt fall.</l>
<l>With Rapture all must view thee Gasp in Death,</l>
<l>And bless the Moment of thy parting Breath.</l>

<l>Who can have Patience 'midst such Shocks of Fate?</l>
<l>Philosophy is vanquish'd in the Strife,</l>

<l>Nay not so much, 'tis vanish'd all and fled.</l>
<l>Hope to a Flatterer is now transform'd,</l>
<l>A perfect Courtier to betray with Smiles,</l>
<l>And if encourag'd, would secure us still,</l>
<l>To deeper Ruin in the Gulph of Fate.</l>
<l>We therefore must expect the worst can come,</l>
<l>And that will as a Preparation serve,</l>
<l>To mitigate the Torments we may feel.</l>
<l>As for my Part I think of nought but Woes,</l>

<l>Monst'rous! why monst'rous?</l>

<l>May it please the most divine SEJANUS,</l>
<l>I have not seen one more extended,</l>
<l>Foul, venomous and hateful to the Sight.</l>
<l>If I may judge, it is a Prodigy,</l>

<l>My Lord, in taking your last Augury,</l>
<l>No prosp'rous Bird appear'd—ill-boding <hi>Ravens</hi></l>
<l>Hover'd up and down—and from the Sacrifice,</l>
<l>Flew to the Prison, where they perch'd all Night,</l>
<l>Flapping the Air with their expanded Wings.</l>
<l>I dare not counsel, but I could entreat,</l>
<l>That great SEJANUS would attempt the Gods,</l>
<l>Once more with Sacrifice.</l>

<l>Of all the Throng that fills th' OLYMPIAN Hall,</l>
<l>I know not that one Deity but FORTUNE,</l>

<l>One Grain of Incense; Or whose Favour buy</l>
<l>At smallest Cost. Her I indeed adore,</l>

<l>Then bid the Priest for Sacrifice prepare,</l>

<l>THOU darling Goddess of my Soul,</l>

<l>Selected from th' OLYMPIAN Hall.</l>

<l>Pays thee Homage most Divine.</l>
<l>Some there are of human-kind,</l>

<l>Accept and grace my Sacrifice.</l>
<stage>(Thunder and Lightning, the Image turns away.)</stage>

<l>Avert this dreadful Omen, sacred Powers,</l>
<l>Somewhat the anger'd Goddess does displease.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sej.</speaker>
<l>Hold, babling Priest, your vile Constructions hold.</l>
<l>Can it not thunder but you shake with Fear?</l>
<l><pb n="51" facs="66"/>
Why should you still interpret things the worst?</l>
<l>This Riddle I can easily expound.</l>
<l>FORTUNE's asham'd to see me bend and pray,</l>
<l>That am more like a Deity than her.</l>
<l>She always hath my faithful Servant been;</l>
<l>Would not a Bondman blush, and turn away,</l>
<l>If he beheld his Lord and Master kneel,</l>
<l>Praying for that which he might well command?</l>
<l>Goddess, I thank thee for this just Rebuke,</l>
<l>And will possess the Honours thou hast giv'n,</l>
<l>Untainted by Religion's sickly Qualms.</l>
<l>I blush to think Credulity could move,</l>
<l>Or win me to such base Servility.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Thunder and Lightning, the Image of Fortune breaks to Pieces, and DRUSUS' Ghost appears on the Pedestal in its Room.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sat.</speaker>
<l>Behold, my Lord, this sudden wond'rous Change.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nat.</speaker>
<l>The very Form of DRUSUS as he liv'd,</l>
<l>It is an Object terrible to Sight.</l>
</sp>

<l>Wherefore should this be, or whence the Cause?</l>
<l>Our Eyes deceive us and there's no such thing.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>Sat.</speaker>
<l>Nay, my Lord, the Vision is most plain,</l>
<l>The Proof speaks loudly in the dread Effects;</l>
<l>The Blood hath left your Cheeks, mine too runs cold,</l>
<l>And all around are struck with wild Amaze.</l>
</sp>

<l>I tell thee, Priest, I have explain'd the Cause,</l>
<l>Why should we pray who never yet have fail'd?</l>
<l>Let them implore who labour under Ills;</l>
<l>When FORTUNE freely gives us all we wish,</l>
<l>'Tis Avarice to importune for more.</l>
<l>This, and this only causes her to frown.</l>

<l>Most Reverend Fathers, for my single self,</l>
<l>I could be most content with private Life,</l>
<l>Abstracted from the Turmoils of the State.</l>
<l>Peaceful Retirement best would suit my Mind.</l>
<l>But for my Emperor's and your lov'd Sakes,</l>
<l>What Pains, what Perils would I not endure?</l>
<l>I have not sought the Honours I enjoy.</l>
<l>Nor yet impress'd by interested Views,</l>
<l>My weak Ambition never soar'd more high</l>
<l>Than to approve me loyal to my Prince,</l>
<l>And still industrious for my Country's Good.</l>
<l>These were the Principles I still preserv'd,</l>
<l>While overflowing Bounties paid my Deeds.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Afe.</speaker>
<l>They have been all deserv'd and many more.</l>
<l>Fathers let's build a Temple to his Fame,</l>
<l>He is the great Protector of our State,</l>
<l>And therefore should be rank'd amongst the Gods.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>AFER, well mov'd—the Senate will approve.</l>

<l>Fathers, forbear, ye know not what ye do,</l>
<l>The swelling Tide of unrestrain'd Success,</l>
<l>Has flow'd so high, as near to break its Bounds,</l>
<l>And Deluge in Destruction o'er the State.</l>
<l>I will remove the Blind which stands before</l>
<l>And stops the Penetration of your Sight,</l>
<l>Shew you this Traytor 'circled round with Guilt,</l>
<l>Whom I have rais'd upon the Wing of Hope;</l>
<l>More to torment him with the Shock of Fate,</l>
<l>Which like the unseen Thunderbolt now falls</l>
<l>To crush this Heap of Villainy to Earth.</l>
<l>Behold this Slave as Serpent to my Breast,</l>
<l>He is the VULTURE would devour us all.</l>

<l>Ay that very Slave,</l>
<l>Whom I have nurs'd and foster'd with my Blood,</l>
<l>Whom rais'd to highest Honour and Renown,</l>
<l>Fathers, ye all seem much amaz'd—he looks surpriz'd.</l>
<l><pb n="58" facs="73"/>
As if that Guilt were foreign to his Soul,</l>
<l>Dissimulation shall not save thee now.</l>
<l>Where is my Son, thou Traitor? turn'st thou pale.</l>
<l>What Fate will your grave Wisdoms here decree</l>
<l>To him, who robb'd my noble Son of Life?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sej.</speaker>
<l>With sudden Accusation thus surpriz'd,</l>
<l>I know not what to answer to my Prince,</l>
<l>'Tis hard that Supposition should condemn,</l>
<l>And blast my faithful Services at once.</l>
<l>May I not hope so much your Highness' Grace,</l>
<l>As Time of Preparation for Defence?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tib.</speaker>
<l>Too well I know thee to let Favour smile</l>
<l>Or give thee Opportunity to 'scape.</l>
<l>Thou would'st have Time t' alarm the servile Herd</l>
<l>Which by the Pow'r I gave, thou hast obtain'd,</l>
<l>As slavish Sycophants to aid thy Cause.</l>
<l>I have ta'en Care to seize thee unprepar'd;</l>
<l>And by our awful CAPITOL I swear,</l>
<l>Thou shalt meet Fate before an Hour's Space.</l>
<l>If any here oppose the just Decree,</l>
<l>He shall be deem'd a Traitor and my Foe.</l>

<l>Most grave and reverend Senators of ROME,</l>
<l>For strictest Justice in your Councils fam'd;</l>
<l>You see me here a most unhappy Wretch,</l>
<l>Stung with Remorse, abhorring my own Guilt,</l>
<l>Of basely joining in such wicked Acts,</l>
<l>As this SEJANUS won me to perform.</l>
<l>Great DRUSUS fell by our complotted Schemes,</l>
<l>And I've, for ever, lost my Peace of Mind.</l>

<l>So sway where awful Justice should preside,</l>

</sp>

<l>Most mighty CAESAR,</l>

<l>Art thou not terrify'd, abandon'd Wretch,</l>
<l>To think what Tortures wait upon thy Crimes?</l>
<l>Henceforth no Trust be held, 'twixt Man and Man,</l>
<l>Since he, whom I still labour'd to promote,</l>
<l>Rais'd from Obscurity to mate with Kings,</l>
<l>Could use that Pow'r unto such wicked Ends.</l>
<l>Had'st thou no grateful Feeling of my Love?</l>

<l>Since they are found, what Matter whence they sprung;</l>

<l>Your Folly rais'd me to such glaring Height,</l>

<l>And my Thoughts soar'd to universal Sway,</l>
<l>Which I had nearly brought within my Grasp.</l>
<l>Now the gay Dream is vanish'd from my Sight.</l>
<l>The Clouds of Fortune to the Glare succeed.—</l>

Such Trophies as might eternize my Name.</l>

<l>Ye all are just and wise to publick View,</l>

<l>Your rotten Hearts still float with Fortune's Tide,</l>

<l>May all your Tongues, as ye together cry,</l>
<l>Together rot, and in Oblivion lie,</l>
<l>All Plagues that Heav'n can send to human Kind,</l>
<l>All Pangs of Body and all Racks of Mind,</l>

<l>When once the Gods their awful Pow'r assume</l>
<l>She meets a certain, and a horrid Doom,</l>
<l>The solid Bliss which never feels Decay,</l>
