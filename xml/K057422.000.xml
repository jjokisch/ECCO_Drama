<head>On seeing Miss YOUNGE in the Character of Lady FLIPPANT SAVAGE.</head>
<l>THE two scenic Muses had long kept a distance,</l>
<l>And scorn'd of each other to borrow assistance;</l>
<l>THALIA was pert, and MELPOMENE proud,</l>
<l>And though of admirers they both had a croud;</l>
<l>Not two rival beauties on earth could be seen</l>
<l>More tortur'd with jealousy, envy and spleen:</l>
<l>Till JOVE, to whom all the celestials submit,</l>
<l>In matters of WEIGHT, or in matters of WIT,</l>
<l>Interpos'd his command, saying, henceforth agree,</l>
<l>United in friendship as Sisters should be;</l>
<l>And grant, as a pledge that your union's sincere,</l>
<l>Your mutual pow'rs to some favourite fair;</l>
<l>If one can be found amongst mortals below</l>
<l>Deserving the attributes you can bestow.</l>
<l>The Sisters obey'd; but unfix'd was their choice,</l>
<l>Till MINERVA appearing with soul-moving voice:</l>
<l>While in scales of suspense both their fancies were hung,</l>
<l>Appeal'd to their senses, and pointed to YOUNGE.</l>
<l>To YOUNGE, where the <hi>smile-stealing comic</hi> we find,</l>
<l>With the <hi>soft,</hi> the <hi>sublime,</hi> and the <hi>graceful</hi> combin'd.</l>
<l>To YOUNGE who can each diff'rent passion impart,</l>
<l>Who <hi>pleases</hi> the <hi>judgement,</hi> but <hi>conquers</hi> the <hi>heart,</hi></l>
<l>And <hi>guided</hi> by NATURE, is <hi>followed</hi> by ART.</l>

<head>PROLOGUE To FASHIONABLE LEVITIES.</head>
<byline>Written by <hi>Mr. CHALMERS.</hi></byline>
<byline>Spoken by <hi>Mr. WROUGHTON.</hi></byline>
<sp>
<l>IN Shakespeare's days we only play'd the fool,</l>
<l>And men of fashion gave—not took—the rule;</l>
<l>Then Lords were grave, and ladies graver still,</l>
<l>And only <hi>we,</hi> and clowns had wit at will;</l>
<l>His mind rejected former classic lore,</l>
<l>And drew from Nature's never-ending store.</l>
<l>But authors <hi>now</hi>—we often prove the fact,</l>
<l>Must fashion court, to teach us how to act.</l>
<l>Expose the follies which our statutes spare,</l>
<l>And unprotected Virtue make their care.</l>
<l>All nature <hi>now</hi> is <hi>custom;—custom, law</hi>;</l>
<l>And here we bring—not what we think,—but saw.</l>
<l>Tis hard to vary your dramatic mirth,</l>
<l>When every folly gives it likeness birth.</l>
<l>Which though, in life, your laugh they may command,</l>
<l>Will rather pall, than please, at second hand.</l>
<l>'Tis harder still to suit the general mind,</l>
<l>And all our audience in our int'rest bind.</l>
<l>Honest John Bull, vex'd with the cares of life,</l>
<l>With heavy taxes and a scolding wife,</l>
<l>Wishes some hours in hearing us to waste,</l>
<l>And <hi>galloping dreary Dun</hi> is quite his taste.—</l>
<l>Sir Foppling too, his brains with claret addle,</l>
<l>Pronounces <hi>Comedy</hi> to be a <hi>Twaddle</hi>!</l>
<l>His Lordship by the privilege of folly,</l>
<l>Is neither musical nor melancholy;</l>
<l>Thinks every honest bard <hi>a queer old Put,</hi>—</l>
<l>"Damme! there's nothing in a play like <hi>smut!</hi></l>
<l>The politician's all-commanding pate,</l>
<l>Would have us dramatize th' affairs of state:</l>
<l>Make whigs and tories fight, here face to face,</l>
<l>And teach the patriots, <hi>Unity of Place.</hi>—</l>
<l>Some cry for sentiment, and some for wit,</l>
<l>And yet our claim to either won't admit.—</l>
<l>The Critic Bench!<note n="*" place="foot">Looking into the Pit.</note> for which there's no appeal,</l>
<l>Since for the town they judge, and act, and feel.</l>
<l>Did you but know what pangs an author shares,</l>
<l>How throbs his heart with anxious doubts and cares!</l>
<l>Let past indulgence your attention keep:</l>
<l>Though we be dull—<hi>Justice</hi> should never <hi>sleep.</hi></l>
<l>And if to-night no merit we can claim,</l>
<l>The want of <hi>power,</hi> not <hi>will,</hi> deserves the blame!</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> GRACE <hi>and Mrs.</hi> MUSLIN.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Mus.</speaker>
<p>AND do you really prefer London to Bath, Mrs. Grace?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Why, I do; in London there's such a noise—such rattling of carts, waggons, coaches, chariots and vis-a-vis; then at night its so charming to see the flambeaux flying about from house to house, like blazing stars!—But what have you got there for my lady, Mrs. Muslin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mus.</speaker>
<p>A few cards of laces.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Foreign, I hope—we hate every thing English, and wear nothing but foreign manufactures.
<stage>(Bell rings)</stage>
My lady's bell.—Any new company come down?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
<speaker>Mrs. Mus.</speaker>
<p>Have heard of none, except the wife and daughter of big Mr. Minikin, the great pinmaker from Threadneedle-street.
<stage>(Bell rings.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Coming, my lady
<stage>(goes to a door in the back scene.)</stage>
It is only Mrs. Muslin, my lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p><stage>within.</stage>
I'll be with her immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Let me have a few words with you before you go—Sir Buzzard and my lady had such tifting yesterday, you never heard the like—They hate each other most affectionately, that is the truth of it—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Lady FLIPPANT SAVAGE <hi>through a door in the back scene.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>So Muslin,
<stage>(sits)</stage>
Heigh ho! I'm all langour and lassitude!—Never knew Bath so dull—Scarce any person of fashion—Nobody one knows—This patch has a pretty effect—And you may go, Grace; and do you hear, Grace, let Miss Constance know I shall be ready to go out in half an hour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my lady.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Muslin, take a chair;—this is certainly English rouge, a vulgar natural red.—Did you see my brute as you came in, Muslin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Mus.</speaker>
<p>Saw two of them, dear pretty animals, in the hall, my lady; the little French dog was playing with the Spanish monkey.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Muslin, are you mad!—my dog and monkey brutes! sweet creatures! I was enquiring after the brute my husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Mrs. Mus.</speaker>
<p>I ask your ladyship's pardon; I saw Sir Buzzard with Colonel Staff, and Mr. Cheaterly in the great parlour.—But I have something to mention to your ladyship—here are the laces—
<stage>(opening the box)</stage>
but it is not about the laces I want to speak—but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>But what?—Heigh ho! hand me the Olympian dew—Muslin, I saw a charming fellow at the play last night, and he saw me—Lady Holden certainly pencils her eye-brows—But the charming fellow, he took up my whole attention from the performance—I flatter myself I engaged his—his eyes were never off me—was dressed in a new Parisian frock.—Hand me the volatile salts, Muslin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Mus.</speaker>
<p>My lodger, I protest!—pick'd the pinion of a chicken at my humble table, last night, and never ceased talking of your ladyship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Hand me the rose water—he spoke of me, you say?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Mus.</speaker>
<p>Heav'ns, said he, what an air!—what grace! then run on in praise of your ladyship's person and beauty; but when he heard your ladyship was married, poor youth, how piteously he sigh'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Good natured charitable soul!—but his name—who is he?—what is he? whence came he?—and who are his relations, Muslin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Mus.</speaker>
<p>Cannot answer one of your ladyship's questions, except that his name is Welford; he came to my house yesterday, and talks of leaving Bath to-morrow morning.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="4" facs="10"/><hi>Enter</hi> GRACE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Cheaterly requests permission to wait upon your ladyship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Shew him up.
<stage><hi>Exit.</hi> Grace.</stage>
Come to demand his winnings;—lost two hundred last night, could think of no card but the knave of hearts I saw at the Theatre.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Mus.</speaker>
<p>The knave—the king of hearts your ladyship means; and let me tell you a trump—never saw finer eyes; then he has the leg of a soldier, and the hand of a lady—but is he to have the honor of—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Of what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Mus.</speaker>
<p>He says he has something of a serious nature to communicate to your ladyship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps letters from some of my friends in Paris.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mus.</speaker>
<p>Saw a large bundle of letters on his table.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Then, Muslin, I leave his introduction to you—shall be at home all the morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mus.</speaker>
<p>Your ladyship's most obedient—I leave the laces.
<stage>(going)</stage>
Never saw a handsomer gentleman.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>What a giddy creature am I? but a body must kill time—then the fellow is so elegant,
<stage>(rises)</stage>
and Sir Buzzard so peevish!—the fatigue and apprehension which body and mind suffer after an unluckly run, are insupportable; my nerves are quite out of tune, but Muslin has in some degree elevated my spirits.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="5" facs="11"/><hi>Enter</hi> CHEATERLY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>I condole with your ladyship on your hard run last night; the aces conspired against you;—Renounce brag, the cunning of the game lies, not in—judgment of mind, but in command of muscles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>La. Flip.</speaker>
<p>To which I impute your uninterrupted series of good luck.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>I am unfit for brag;—the warmth of my heart, particularly in your ladyship's presence,
<stage>(bows low.)</stage>
keeps my features in continual rebellion,—but no person with a flexible countenance should touch brag, the impenetrable looks of lady Frigid Midnight, have established her an adept at the game.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>La. Flip.</speaker>
<p>And her nimble fingers give her command of the cards; but she lost temper when I got the black knaves; it was when you stood on my right, and lord Lackacre on my left hand.—"I have got the black knaves," said I, "Lady Frigid"—"I see you have," said she, pointing to you and my lord,—then, as she puckered up her mouth in an affected smile, down fell a few flakes of paint, and her skin appeared under the fractures, like <hi>old</hi> brick work peeping through the <hi>new</hi> invented composition.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Her countenance was once tolerable, but a long run of ill luck, has stamp'd that irrisible discordancy, of hill and dale, which marks her visage, and prevents the smiles of fortune, joy, or good humour, from unbending her to a laugh, or the smallest semblage of the amiable.
<stage>(<hi>Hums a tune.</hi>)</stage>
There is a small matter between us, for which I have a very pressing occasion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside.)</stage>
I expected this! Ha! ha! ha! I cannot but laugh at your description of Lady Frigid.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>For heav'n's sake say no more of her;—but, let me have the money.
<stage>(bows.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>The money! Psha! You must have patience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Patience for a debt of honour!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>I have bills to pay—my mercer, milliner, and mantua-maker, are to be with me to-morrow, and people of that class, you know, are rude and importunate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>But suppose I point out a mode of discharging this debt of honour without diminishing your ladyship's purse—what say you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>If you have any thing to propose I can honourably receive, speak out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Your ladyship is not usually slow of apprehension;—it is true, I have not made an open declaration of my passion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>But my eyes, my looks, have spoke the workings of my soul.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Goes from him confused)</stage>
This I never suspected.
<stage>(Aside)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>May I hope for your assistance towards my happiness; I have long loved, doated, and despaired.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Long loved and doated! I'm not surprized at that.
<stage>(Aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Sir Buzzard knows of, and approves my passion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>La. Flip.</speaker>
<p>Sir Buzzard approves it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>He does,—and I cannot live—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Hold, Sir!
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
I'm astonish'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>I cannot live without her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Without her! without whom?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Who but Constance!—divine Constance!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside.)</stage>
Though I despise the fellow!—I—I—but why should I be ruffled?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>She thought I was making love to herself.
<stage>(Aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>And wou'd you have me accessary to the ruin of a young creature?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>There is no ruin intended;—I have open'd my mind to the lady,—Sir Buzzard is my friend, and I only solicit your interest; I would marry Constance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>No ruin intended! could a greater curse befal a young creature than to marry you!—who are you, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Who am I, madam! a gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>I don't mean to asperse your birth, Sir; but is not your ruling passion play; your principal dependance cards and dice; your most intimate connections jockies, grooms, gamecocks, and race-horses? I am surprized you could look up to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>My fortune and family entitle me to look up to any woman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Then it must be merely to look up; you are, no doubt, one of Fortune's favourites, and her favours follow you;—you have large estates in expectancy, and considerable rents in Bath, Wells, Scarborough, Southampton and Margate; nay, more, you have as many agents as the first landed gentleman in the country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>I don't understand this treatment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>La. Flip.</speaker>
<p>Your connexions, manners and conversation
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
would be perfectly agreeable to Constance's turn of mind;—her respect for religion, her morality, philosophy, and knowledge of the belles lettres, would exactly coincide with your studies in the arts and sciences of play.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Arts and sciences of play—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>La. Flip.</speaker>
<p>I insinuate nothing injurious to your profession; the respect which professors of play receive in preference to all other professors proves it a profession the most liberal, as well as most profitable.
<stage>(ironically.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>She will never forgive the insult of preferring another woman to herself;
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
Your tradesmen's bills, madam, are unpaid, your ladyship's mercer and milliner—and people of that class are so importunate and rude;—I do not solicit you to take an active part in my favour, only promise not to be an enemy, and the debt of honour is cancelled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>You say the debt of honour shall be cancelled. Are you aware that Constance has bestowed her favours on young De Courcy, of York.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and that his passion for play was cooled at the last York races, which obliged him to take a trip to France for the recovery of his finances.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>And his losses she imputes to a conspiracy between you and those friends of yours, who were the ostensible winners, and to whom you introduced him;—I sear you have no chance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Chance!—leave me to that;—I have often won with the odds against me; then she is a beggar, but my passion is disinterested.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>And pray now, how much of the
<pb n="9" facs="15"/>
uncle's debt of honour is to be paid by this parental kindness to the niece?—I see into the scheme,—and here comes the unfortunate sacrifice.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> CONSTANCE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I understand your ladyship desired to speak with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>To inform you, my dear, of some engagements, but particular business calls me away for a few minutes, so I leave you to entertain Mr. Cheaterly.

Her modest blush puts even my impudence out of countenance!—your solicitude, madam, to avoid me, so strongly indicates apathy to my addresses, I almost dread the possibility of convincing you I am sincere;—do not turn from me in scorn; I may have some claim upon your gratitude, though no interest in your heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Gratitude! Oh! Your absence, Sir, I must insist on; I will not, in future, be persecuted by your presumption!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>I acknowledge my weakness in pursuing the impulse of my passion; reason checks me, but such is the imperious violence of my affection, that even your scorn increases my desires, by making you lovely in the midst of anger, and the blessing I sigh for, appears still more valuable, more worthy pursuit, from the distant prospect you give me of the possession.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Prospect, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Yes, madam, prospect.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>You will be pleased, Sir, to withdraw—
<stage>walks disconcerted.</stage>
you are insolent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Insolent! a hard word, madam, to a man who prefers you to every other woman,—I may be bold, madam, but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I repeat it, you are insolent.</p>
</sp>
<stage>walks from him.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>I am calm, madam; I know the impediment to my happiness, young lady, and have spirit to remove it.—Insolent! ha; you prefer a clandestine correspondence with a bankrupt in fame and fortune, to the generous addresses of a man, honoured with your uncle's approbation, and independent of the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>The engagements of my heart—but I will not weep—
<stage>(wiping her eyes)</stage>
—Sir—you have, with a base and mean cowardice, dared to traduce a generous, unsuspecting youth, whose fortune you have assisted to ruin, but whose honour you can never taint;—a youth who, if present, you would not dare to look on withouttrembling.

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Sir BUZZARD SAVAGE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>What's the matter now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Enquire of that gentleman, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>What a life I lead! my mind kept in a continual fever, you and your aunt are a perpetual ague to me;—her hot fits of levity, and your cool fits of prudery, operate alternately, and I am tortured by you from morning till night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I must tell you, Sir, that since your house cannot afford me protection, I shall leave it; and, though destitute of fortune, I know where to apply for an asylum.
<stage><hi>Ex.</hi> Constance.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>"I know where to apply for an asylum!"—She cannot have a knowledge of our secret, or I would suppose she meant the Chancery;
<pb n="11" facs="17"/>
a man must now pay as much attention to his ward, as if she was his child.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>True, and what adds to the grievance, if a young fellow marries an heiress, he is obliged to settle her fortune on herself, though, perhaps, her person was a secondary object,—I shall never succeed here, Sir Buzzard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Pish, why not succeed; a hundred to one but all she has said is pretence,—you know nothing of women's subtilty; they smile, they frown, they laugh, they weep, they move but to deceive us, and lay a snare in every article of their dress.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>De Courcy is the object of her choice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Why afraid of De Courcy? his friends at York races plucked the poor devil of a pigeon so bare, they scarcely left him feathers to fly into France.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>I was present;—may I depend on your assistance?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Is not our bargain concluded?—on the day of your marriage with my niece, you return me my mortgages, the bill of sale upon my horses, and an acquittance of all demands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Depend upon it—I have pledg'd my honour;—assist me, and I will pursue my game, though she keeps me at bay every step.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Cheaterly, I must look about me; I came down here for the recovery of my health, and am suffering under a precipitate consumption of my purse. Do you think the young clergyman plays fair?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>You mean parson Spruce; could you suspect a divine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Why, yes; I do suspect your divines
<pb n="12" facs="18"/>
in their own hair, and boots, many of them I believe have thrown off morality with their wigs, and kicked away religion with their shoes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>But Dr. Spruce has three hundred a year in the church—he won a cool fifty from me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>A fifty! I lost more to him than would purchase four years of his income.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Do you want cash? I can lend you a hundred; here
<stage>(gives him a note)</stage>
with friends money should be a common commodity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Why I lost this note to Parson Spruce last night—he gave me a fifty and took it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Aye, Oh, I had it from him, he gave it to me for a bill on London.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Here comes Colonel Staff and old Ordeal yoked together, very naturally, as two asses should be;—I despise them both: the Colonel never served abroad, yet he prates as bold as if he had experienced half a dozen foreign campaigns.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>And is poor and proud.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but hopes to mend his fortune by marrying my sister; I wish him success, that they may mutually torment each other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Mark Ordeal, he is not a less extraordinary character than the Colonel, the fellow was a foundling, and never knew his parents, but having acquired a fortune by trade, impudently insults his betters, by preaching what he calls generosity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>O, confound his generosity, he is always setting a bad example with his charities,
<pb n="13" facs="19"/>
relieving widows, providing for orphans, and portioning off young maidens; though ignorant as a Hottentot, he has got himself rank'd among the literati, and sets up for a philosopher—the fellow has come into life through as many shapes as an Orkney Barnacle, he was first a block, then a worm, and is now a goose.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Colonel</hi> STAFF, <hi>and Mr.</hi> ORDEAL.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! I have been accusing Ordeal of avarice, and he denies the charge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>I do, avarice, though too often an attendant on age, is a vice foreign to my nature; no man can accuse me of accumulating money by unjust means, or of hoarding it when in my possession; whereas avarice is a dropsy of the mind—a disease that irritates and increases by the means used to assuage its thirst.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Have you not refused to lend me a mere trifle, and being rich, is not that a proof of avarice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Hear me;—I consider myself an agent, bound to answer for the distribution of that wealth with which heaven has bless'd my industry—the charge of avarice is more applicable to the spendthrift than the prudent, the spendthrift grasps at every man's property; yet no man is accounted avaricious who conforms to the custom of dissipation; though the spendthrift raises his rents, and starves his tenantry—borrows money and ruins his friend, or runs in debt, and makes bankrupts of his tradesmen, if he drives a carriage—keeps a train of servants, plays, drinks, and plunges into vice, the world will call him a damn'd generous fellow—I speak my mind—that's my way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="20"/>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Well, Colonel, how goes on your affair with my fantastical sister? She is a jilt, Colonel.—I hate a jilt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>She will soon surrender, I have got possession of the counterscarp▪ and shall shortly set up the standard of matrimony upon the crown of the—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Horn work—Eh?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>The widow has a considerable share of the <hi>toujours gai</hi> in her composition.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Too much to promise constancy; but then you old bachelors have such winning ways—but Colonel, keep a centinel on my sister—time and possession are two dangerous pioneers; the first moulders the cement by degrees; and the other saps the foundation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Then the widow is so frank, degagé and good natured, she may grant favors from charity and sensibility, which other women would refuse from principle, or the prejudice of education.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>What Mr. Cheaterly has advanced, contains profound gravity of judgment; but my Clary shall have no modern education, I have engaged a master to teach her the Classics, to manure the soil by cultivating the seeds of virtue;—yes, I will have Clary cultivated; for she is innocence itself: free from the bias of example, she is guided only by the impulse of pure nature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>A young lady could not have a more dangerous preceptor, the impulse of pure nature will produce every evil that can arise from the politest education.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>I am convinc'd she is delicate as the ermine,
<pb n="15" facs="21"/>
which would die to preserve the snowy whiteness of its fur.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Well said, my old friend, amorous as May, though grey as December.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Grey! Nay, let me tell you, Colonel; though snow has fallen upon the mountain, there is sunshine in the valley—Clara is an Aurora Borealis, a blaze in the regions of frigidity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Ordeal, seriously, now, are you going to marry this ward of your's for love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Seriously, I love the girl as I love my life; but if I did not, having no relations nor friends to whom I owe any obligation, I am determined to make her my heir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>And no doubt she will bring you an heir in return, and then bury you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Bury me!—Granted: when I sleep peaceable under the green turf, let her marry some honest young fellow, and their children shall bear my name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>A good way this to raise a family without trouble.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Family, I understand your sneer, I was a foundling it is true, and cannot boast ancestry; yet I have a heart susceptible of the tender feelings and sweet solicitudes of humanity. Though I cannot claim relations of particular descriptions, I know Adam and Eve were our primitive parents, therefore, consider the world one common family, and hold myself bound to all mankind by ties of fraternal love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>And your family kindness is not confined to your brothers, but extends to your sisters too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Clara's father was my friend, we serv'd our apprenticeship together, set up in the same
<pb n="16" facs="22"/>
branch of trade, he failed, and died poor, but I prospered—he was a worthy soul, and I never speak of him without tears.
<stage>(weeps.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Ah! very good, Sir Buzzard; because the father was his juvenile friend he would marry the daughter in his old age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>A pretty excuse for a vicious appetite.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Hear, hear!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Clara's father, when on his death-bed, bequeathed her to me as a legacy, it was a bequest of confidence, and I esteem it more than if it had been a million: he bequeathed her to me an infant without a mother, without relations, without friends, without fortune.—Now, though rich in the liberal gifts of nature, who hath endowed her with an exuberant hand, yet being poor in worldly substance, she hath but few attractions for a husband; the knight errants of these days are Argonauts—this is the golden age and every thing is bought and sold.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Spoke in the true spirit of commerce, my old merchant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Let me tell you, Sir Knight, the spirit of commerce is the best spirit in the nation; we merchants live by barter and sale it is true, but take this with you, sir, probity is our principle, and our character nice as a lady's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Here comes my moiety of mortality—here comes the origin of two thirds of my complaints, with my widow'd sister, the Colonel's tormentor that is to be—see, they smile at some mischief in embryo—Ah, candied ginger, sugar on the outside, fire within, sweet on the palate, biting on the tongue.

<p>Are you here, Colonel? I follow you as the little bird does the cuckoo—Mr. Ordeal, your most obedient, how is pretty Clara, and when are we to call her Mrs. Ordeal.—You rear her quite a domestic animal, she is never seen abroad.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Nor at home, sister, not even at the windows.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>He fears the sun would spoil her complexion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>She hath indeed a lovely complexion, glowing and bright as the Tyrian dye, not a modern local blush, that hides shame instead of discovering it; but ruddy health moving in varied tints—the lily and the rose vying for pre-eminence on her cheek!—O she is pure nature!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>But when introduced to life those roses will blow, those lilies will fade.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>She shall never get into any life, but where they may blow and fade naturally—her real face shall never be concealed under a counterfeit; some ladies coin complexions, and should be punished for high treason in defacing beauty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Bravo, old Ordeal! bravo!</p>

<p>Strict honour was his principle—but alas, he experienced that was not the medium

<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>This widow of mine, Ordeal, hath a prolific flow of wit and spirits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and egad I thought she struck you dumb—she has a prolific tongue too, sharp as the arrow of a Bornean Indian, and tipp'd with poison; your union with her will be happy—perfectly happy—though I recollect she compared you to a cuckoo, a bird of omen; yes, a cuckoo is a very ominous bird—pray, Colonel, is the widow skilled in augury?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Damn your cuckoo! but your speaking of augury reminds me of a circumstance at the siege of Prague—a flock of rooks—</p>

<p>I cannot say I'm very happy; nor I cannot say I am displeased; I do not wish to be married, nor have I any objection to a husband—Heigho!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>But to confess the truth, you have no desire to marry Mr. Ordeal, he is such an old fellow; though if addressed by a handsome, wealthy, good natured youth, you'd—Heigho!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>Do not speak disrespectfully of my guardian—he is very kind to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>I approve your prudence in preferring an old lover to a young one; after marriage you will no longer be confined like an infant;—then you will enjoy such pleasure in making his money fly, and in seeing him approach the grave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>But for fear he should live too long, be sure you get him a physician.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>A physician! O, death!</p>

<sp>

<p>My guardian has taught me how a married lady ought to conduct herself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Let us hear, my dear pretty creature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>I have it by heart; he has taught me, that all young men are cunning and deceitful, and that I must never listen to or believe their flattering tongues; that a man and his wife are one person, and should act as if inspired by one soul!—that a wife should not complain of her husband to her most intimate friends, nor form any connexions without his approbation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>There's instruction for you; you see we take care of her soul.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>Moreover, he has taught me, that in private a wif should receive no company without
<pb n="33" facs="39"/>
her husband's knowledge, and in public should not think herself protected but by his presence; that she should obey him in all things, and place her highest delight in making him happy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>These were the duties of a wife in the last century,—but we will instruct you in the duties of a wife, who would cut a figure in the polite circles of the present day▪—Sister, begin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Must consider matrimony a means to increase liberty, and defy scandal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Must retain your favourite cicisbeo, confidante, maid servant and footman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>That will be, I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>See whom you please, where you please, and when you please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>That must be very pleasant!—go on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Must be mistress of your own hours,—turn day into night, and night into day.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Keep a separate purse, a separate carriage, and a separate bed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Never attend to oeconomy, but sink, play, and squander your money, to the last shilling, and stretch your husband's credit to the utmost.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Here is work cut out for mantua-makers and milleners.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>You must always dissimulate in conversation with your husband, and when you cannot deceive you must insist—if he opposes your will, rant, and laugh at him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>There was just such a fellow as this at the Havannah—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>There were several such fellows at the Havannah, and such fellows only could have beaten the brave fellows who defended it,—were you there?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>My regiment did service there—and if it had not been for a damn'd ague,—but no matter,—I overlook this fellow's insolence,—but Mr. Ordeal, you have been too severe on the ladies</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="36" facs="42"/>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Too severe on the ladies—I am your echo again—zounds, do you take the man for a Shrove-Tide cock, set up to receive blows without returning them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Let's go, we are not likely to receive protection from the Colonel.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Stand off, fellow—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>These are ladies of honour.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Their honour, like your courage, is in their own possession, but remember the character of both is in the opinion of others.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Do you hear the fellow?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>He's mad, and not worth notice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Were I Clara, I should prefer a young Indian, though sure of being his widow; and burning with him in a month, to living with you for an age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Ordeal, you shall answer this—but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>But what dare you say?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Say—I say—my immediate duty is to attend the ladies.</p>

<stage><hi>Enter Lady</hi> FLIPPANT SAVAGE <hi>and</hi> GRACE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>SHALL I introduce the Gentleman, my lady?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Yes,—no,—yes, Grace.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>I like the gentleman, because he likes your ladyship,—and that shews him a man of taste—I go.—
<stage>(going)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Stay, Grace,—let me consider, this interview may be attended with all the ill consequences of an illicit correspondence.—what are you musing on Grace?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>I am thinking how very ugly Sir Buzzard is in comparison with your ladyship's lover.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Sir Buzzard's plainness, Grace, is not his worst fault,—it is his peevish asperity of disposition renders him odious to me,—Grace, I will not see this gentleman, it will endanger my reputation.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Lay, my lady, but consider, <hi>my</hi> reputation, my <hi>honour</hi> is pledged,—he is a delightful creature.—Then consider what an airy, nice dressed gentleman he is—and consider, Sir Buzzard wears flannel under-waistcoats, and swanskin stockings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Can I ever again face Sir Buzzard?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>If I was your ladyship, I would not face my lover too suddenly,—no, I would recline
<pb n="38" facs="44"/>
upon the sopha,—
<stage>(sits)</stage>
lost in thinking,—so,—with my fan shading my face thus, and every thing about me. degagee.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>You say he waits.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Or when the dear man approach'd, turn short—strike him with the full flash of my charms, and scream out. Ah!—
<stage>(screams and starts up.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Are you mad, girl?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>A thousand pardons, my lady, but protest I am beside myself.
<stage>Exit. Grace.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>There is no retracting, and I think I <hi>will</hi> take him by surprise.—I'll keep up the appearance of resentment, and have the satisfaction of hearing him humbly plead for pardon—
<stage>(sits, with ber back to the door)</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> GRACE, <hi>and</hi> WELFORD <hi>full dressed.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Now you must acknowledge I am your friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>My sweet girl, I do acknowledge it—
<stage>Exit. Grace.</stage>
A fine figure!
<stage>(taps lady Flippant on the shoulder,—she starts)</stage>
Madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Heaven defend me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Not from an ardent lover!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside)</stage>
I cannot scold the fellow he looks so pleasant!—Pray, Sir, by what warrant do you come here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>I understand from Mrs. Muslin, by warrant from your own lips,—but the warrant is incompleat till your ladyship has affix'd the privy seal to it
<stage>(offers to kiss her).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="39" facs="45"/>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>A married woman can grant nothing without the consent of her husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Well thought on; but I do not come unprepared, man and wife are one person, and when a married lady gives me reason to think a tete-a-tete would not be disagreeable, I always take care to bring my authority along with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>But suppose a lady should acknowledge your authority;—your inclinations, I imagine, Sir, could not easily be attach'd to a single object.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Yes they could,—though I candidly acknowledge I entertain an affection for the whole sex.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Then there is an individual you prefer to the whole sex?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>There is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Handsome?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Sensible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>And you really prefer her—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>If I denied it I should be insincere and unworthy your attention.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>And pray, Sir, may I enquire, who is the favourite fair?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Nay, the less we say, or think of her, the better, she is absent—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir,—I perceive she is absent—
<stage>(walks about)</stage>
and you too are absent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Yes, she is absent,—and—Sir Buzzard is absent, and we are together,—and you are a fine woman,—and I am—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>What, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="40" facs="46"/>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>A man,—a young man, not a very ill made man, and a very well dress'd man, with a brisk flow of spirits, a warm heart, and a soul which at this instant vibrates with sensibility.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buzzard</speaker>
<p><stage>(within).</stage>
I say it is false, I left all the papers in London—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>I protest Sir Buzzard is at the door—you must be concealed again—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Unfortunate!
<stage>(she pushes him in)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>You cannot get out of that room till I please—
<stage>(sits)</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Sir</hi> BUZZARD SAVAGE, and GRACE <hi>walking lame.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Oh, mercy, Sir, you have ruin'd me; oh, my lady, my lady, oh, oh, I shall faint with pain; just when I got to the door, there was my master, and not knowing it, I run plump against him, and he trod upon my foot,—oh,—but it is much better.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p><stage>(sits)</stage>
A messenger is come down from London for the title deeds of Prospect Farm,—do you know where they are?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>What should I know about your musty parchments?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Why not?—you spend the rents fast enough—but I remember now, they are in a box that lies in the wardrobe in that room, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>La, Sir,—I will get it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>You are not tall enough to reach it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>But I can stand on a chair, Sir, though I need not do that,—our new footman is in the closet settling your cloaths, Sir.—yes, Sir,—
<pb n="41" facs="47"/>
our new footman, Sir, is in the closet sett'ling your honour's wardrobe, and he'll help me.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit Grace.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage>
What can she mean? shall I desire Grace to bring the box out to you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>No, let the footman bring it out, I have not seen him yet,—Grace, bid the fellow bring in the box.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace</speaker>
<p><stage>(within)</stage>
He's taking it down, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Leave it in the closet, I must get some other papers out of the scrutore

</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> GRACE <hi>and</hi> WELFORD <hi>in a Livery, with a box.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Come, young man, I'll get you my lady's cards for Wednesday's route, and they must be delivered immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage>
What a metamorphosis!—you'll be expeditious.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>A good looking fellow;—but stand off;—he is enough to suffocate a man with perfume! What's your name, Civet Cat?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p><stage>(in a strong brogue)</stage>
What's my name? I was christen'd Patrick, your honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>An Irishman!—eh,—heav'n knows we had blunders enough in the family before,—
<stage>(looking on the box)</stage>
—this is the wrong box.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit Sir Buzzard into the closet.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Yes, we have all got into the wrong box
<stage>(aside)</stage>.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>When next we meet—
<stage>Exit</stage>.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Nothing could be more lucky, my lady,—the new livery that came home for your last footman George, lay in the bottom of my master's wardrobe. I must see him safe out—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="42" facs="48"/>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>This is too mortifying, it hurts my pride—had I met a man of a generous disposition—but here comes my torment, and reflection flies.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Sir</hi> BUZZARD <hi>with</hi> WELFORD's <hi>Cloaths.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>I have found more than I sought for, Lady Flippant;—who am I to thank for this addition to my wardrobe?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>These cloaths!—you mean these cloaths!—he, he, he,—they are really very pretty cloaths—you like them, my dear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>No, I don't like them, my dear; and who the devil did they come from, my dear? and to whom do they belong, my dear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Elegant manufacture!—nothing like it made in England.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Where did they come from?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Paris.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Who owns them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>They are your cloaths, my love!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Mine! Did you ever see me wear such frippery?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yours positively; but I did not intend you should have seen them—they were smuggled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Smuggled!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Yes, smuggled from Paris, by my milliner, and sent here for the purpose of ornamenting you, my sweet love!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Sweet love!—now that's fulsome—yet thou art my sweet love!</p>

<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Yes, like an apothecary's dose,—my bitter sweet.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>How ill-natur'd!—but no matter, you shall wear these cloaths at the ball this evening.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>I will not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>You shall.</p>

<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Very well, Sir, then I'll send 'em back.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>They shall not be sent back, I begin to like them,—a good colour, and not too gaudy.—I'll keep them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Keep them!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and wear them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Wear them,—where?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>At the ball this evening.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>I fear you will take cold.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>You wish I should take cold, but I will not take cold,—and I will wear the cloaths; you lay out a revenue on your back, and I will, at least for this once, follow your example.—I'll keep the cloaths, and go to the ball in them this evening.</p>

<p>It was good luck he did not find the gentleman's sword—yet little matter if he had, for intriguing with an incumbrance about him; but how shall I get him away?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Poor soul! he must have patience—contrive to convey him through the garden, to a chair, he may pretend he is a servant taken ill, which will blind suspicion.</p>

To seduce such innocence would be damnable; when you are married to Mr. Ordeal, my instructions will no longer please,—you love him?</p>

<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>I do indeed, as much as if he was my father,—but I never think of him when you are present.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Then you love him from gratitude?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>Just so!—could I have any other motive
<pb n="49" facs="55"/>
—If there be any other kind of love, I wish you'd let me know it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>There is another kind,—give me your hand—there is a love known by its effects, it beats on the pulse, trembles on the breath, gives eyes to the thoughts, and thoughts to the eyes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>O la! then I'm sure you are in love, for your eyes speak and laugh,—why did you touch my hand?—indeed—indeed, I'm afraid I have taken it from you—I hope there's no danger in it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Love is the child of desire, nurs'd by delight—weaned by inconstancy, consumed by neglect, kill'd by dissembling, and buried by ingratitude.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>How cruel to kill it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>But then 'tis the parent of jealousy, the disuniter of friendship, and cause of disobedience; an arbitrary tyrant of the mind, that triumphs over wisdom, tramples upon prudence, and vanquishes even virtue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>O, you fright me with that description.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>But where virtue is the basis of this passion, it produces the utmost happiness enjoyed on earth, and gives mortals a taste of heaven!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>Now that is delightful! and to tell you the truth I have heard my guardian speak of it, but I could never feel it in his hand as I did in your's; he says—"love is fire full of cold—honey full of gall—and pleasure full of pain;"—but I see he knows nothing of the matter;—are you really in love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my dear, deeply—deeeply;—but why do you ask?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Because—</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ORDEAL.</stage>
<sp>

<p>Very well—very well—here Nicholas!—where's the rascal? Clara, my dear, seek him, and give orders for dinner, there's a good girl.

<p>Heigho!

I obey, Sir.
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Clara.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>An amiable, modest creature, Mr. M'Classic—nothing ardent in her disposition, has no more idea of love than an infant, yet a charming fertilizing constitution, but chaste as ice,—"her heart like the salamander—cold, cold, in the midst of flame."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Virtue beams in her een, and animates her countenance; like the finishing touches of the painter, it enlivens the portrait, and increases the beauty of the object.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Poetically conceiv'd, and prettily pronounc'd;—yes, she shrinks from the touch like the sensitive plant—you have a prolific imagination, Mr. M'Classic, considering you come from a northern climate
<stage>(<hi>viewing Douglas</hi>)</stage>
—yet Mr. M'Classic, there is no judging of a woman's chastity, who has never been in the way of temptation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Very true, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>And women are virtuous in proportion to the temptations they withstand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>A just conclusion, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Then you think it would be difficult to find a young inexperienced girl proof against promises, sighs and tears—and who could withstand the cunning insinuations of a lover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="51" facs="57"/>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Well, I think differently; I think I could trust Clara—but she's a nonpareil—yes, cool as a cucumber in a hot bed—yet not prone to vegetation—but M'Classic, I have an experiment to make, and you must assist me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Command me, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Clara I think is a pure lamb.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Sir, there can be no doubt; but you were speaking of an experiment, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>I have fortified her mind with morals, which will prove a shield to her by day, and a breast-plate by night.—But the experiment—you must be my instrument.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>In what respect, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>To sound the depth of her inclinations,—to feel how the pulse of her affection beats towards me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>If she should not like me—but that is a point for future consideration—if she should like me, I will marry her in the morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Marry her, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Yes, marry her, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>And in the morning. O my heart! and must I lose her after all?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>In the morning—I have had a special licence sometime—yes, she loves me—I know she loves me—and soon as we have dined, I will go to Sir Buzzard's, to engage him and his friends to attend the ceremony. In the mean time you must try the experiment—come-in to dinner, and I'll give you further instructions.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>What can I do?—Would you have me court the girl for you? Besides, this business raises a qualm in my conscience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Conscience!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Yes, conscience!—my conscience cannot boast such extensive latitude and longitude as your's,—you have a convenient conscience, it stretches or contracts like India rubber; your conscience is a servant of all work—which you discharge at a moment's warning.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Colonel</hi> STAFF.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>May the fire of a platoon never again raise my spirits, but it would be better for a man to attack a breach daily and on a forlorn hope, than to sit down before a coquet.</p>

<sp>

<p>"Have you ever attacked a breach, Colonel?"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>You hear he has attacked a widow, and upon a forlorn hope."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>I say, Sir, your sister is a coquet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>I say she is a downright jilt. He who confides in the sex will be deceived—I despise them.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="53" facs="59"/>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>"But not from affection to the girl, I keep her because it pleases my humour, and vexes my wife." You know the sex but superficially; there is my rib, when we married, she was all delicacy and good humour, and from her smooth behaviour and oily tongue, I considered her a miracle of goodness. But the wind soon veer'd about, and before the end of the honey-moon blew a rank storm.</p>

<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>"Talking of storms."</p>

<p>Ordeal, I understand they have been abusing you—but their best friends cant 'scape their malignity—they have tongues of charcoal, with which they are for ever blackening or burning characters.</p>

<p>I shall, immediately set off with my bride for London, from whence we will proceed on the grand tour.</p>

<p>Have not I heard you exclaim against the grand tour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>You have heard me exclaim against sending our youth abroad without a proper controul. You have heard me say, that on such expeditions they too often contaminate their native virtue and constitutions, by bartering the honest habits acquired in old England, for the

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Then I suppose you will no longer restrain her taste in dress—but allow her to throw off her present thin attire, and appear like a fashionable christian,—in feathers and a hoop.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>A hoop! no—it makes a woman appear like a walking sphere, encircled from the nadir to the meridian—and if the effeminacy of the men was not so well known, one would be apt to imagine that the women were all in a state of—But I will not speak my mind now,—though it is my way.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>"Nothing between them indeed, Sir, that is the naked truth."
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Grace.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Then give me leave, Sir, to enquire who you are? and what are your pretensions to visit my niece?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>As to my pretensions, Sir, nothing can be better founded,—I love the lady,—but what is still more material, the lady has long since confess'd that she loves me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Candid and open.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>And your name is De Courcy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>To that name I was born, but an old good natured uncle taking it into his head to visit elizium—in obedience to his will, and in gratitude for sixteen hundred pounds a year, I now bear the name and arms of Welford.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>You seem an honest fellow, worthy the love of Constance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>What is his honesty to me? I am to inform you, Sir, the father of Constance is dead; I am her natural guardian, and you shall never have my consent to marry her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>May I never obtain her consent, if ever I ask yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>She has not a shilling fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>I am glad of it, I have sufficient fortune for both,—I will settle a fortune on her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>A fellow of noble generosity!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>There is a gentleman, I am determined she shall marry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Mark me,—let that gentleman be whom he may, if he presumes to speak to her, write to her,—or even thinks of her as a wife, I shall
<pb n="60" facs="66"/>
make him such an example—but this is losing time,—farewell, I must wait on Constance.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(going.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Opposing him.)</stage>
You shall not go an inch into my house,—that is your way out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>I will go into any man's house, Sir, where she is,—debar me access to my love!—Were you the Grand Signor, and detain'd her, I would force into the inmost recesses of your seraglio, put you to death in the midst of your Janissaries, and carry her off in triumph.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>I do not often swear, it is not my way, but damn me if I would not assist you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Nay, then we must try your courage,
<stage>(lays his hand upon his sword)</stage>
—O, for an estringent to brace my nerves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Excuse me from running you through the body while you wear my cloaths; that coat is in excellent taste, and I cannot think of running it through the body.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>A soldier, and a wit!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Take it, take it;
<stage><hi>(throws off</hi> Welford<hi>'s coat)</hi></stage>
—now let me see if you get into my house.
<stage>(draws.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>What, going to sight a duel!—Oh, for shame!—duelling is a mode of satisfaction unworthy gentlemen, practis'd now by every vulgar fellow;—people of fashion should explode it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Trembling.)</stage>
You know I pay great respect to your opinion,—and if,—but he shall not go into my house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Consider what an improper place for quarreling.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Well.</speaker>
<p>You are right, Sir, this is too cold a situation for stripping;—
<stage><hi>(takes up the cloaths
<pb n="61" facs="67"/>
and hands them to</hi> Ordeal.)</stage>
now for Constance, love, and happiness.
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Welford, <hi>running.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Bravo, my boy!—bravo!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Sure some malign devil has determin'd to make me ridiculous!—let me after him.
<stage>(Ordeal holds him.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Lady</hi> FLIPPANT, MUSLIN, <hi>and</hi> GRACE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Are you mad, Sir Buzzard?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Stark mad!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Nearly stark naked mad.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>The cloaths,—the smuggled cloaths you provided for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Away! you old—get home;—perhaps your Scotch tutor may prepare Pure Nature for the grand tour, and provide you more company than you expect.—Why did I marry?—why plunge into a mortal disease, for which there is no remedy but poison,—no relief but death?
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Sir Buzzard.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Can I see Constance?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>She is lock'd up in her own apartment to avoid her lover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>To avoid him!—He is a noble fellow, and she must have him;—I will in to Sir Buzzard, and argue this case:—He presumes to controul this young lady, his niece, by parental authority; but I will convince him, the principle of that authority is to make our children or wards happy,—not miserable.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Ordeal.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mus.</speaker>
<p>Sir Buzzard is in a horrid rage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>I must contrive to appease him. Constance I suppose has her suspicions;—an
<pb n="62" facs="68"/>
amicable girl—I really love her, pity her situation, and am determined never to see Welford again, but for the purpose of facilitating a marriage between them.—I must also effectuate a breach between my sister and this pusilanimous colonel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mus.</speaker>
<p>That may be easily accomplished—the widow has no small share of vanity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>True!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mus.</speaker>
<p>We must persuade her she was the object of Mr. Welford's admiration.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>I will swear he brib'd me to introduce him to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mus.</speaker>
<p>And I will contrive to get her and the gentleman together at my house, and your ladyship shall send the Colonel to surpirze them, which will produce an irreconcileable quarrel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Here comes the widow—do you lay the train.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter the widow</hi> VOLATILE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>De Courcy is gone, after a very loud altercation with Cheaterly, which terminated in mutual vows of vengeance; he charges Cheaterly with having imposed on him at play.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>There is nothing scandalous in that—play has become a science, fashionable in practice, and like other <hi>faux pas,</hi> 'tis only blameable in discovery. Pray how has Constance behaved?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wdi.</speaker>
<p>Remains locked up in her own room▪ and perseveres in denying an interview to her lover:—this De Courcy is in my opinion a charming fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>But I must know for what purpose he was brought into my closet.—I am certain Constance was not the object; so speak, Grace.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="63" facs="69"/>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Well, my lady, the truth is, the gentleman came after the widow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>I thought so,—this duplicity, sister, hurts me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Dear, my lady, it is all my fault,—the gentleman saw Mrs. Volatile at the play with your ladyship, and sent for me in the morning—and,—but am I sure of pardon if I tell?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Yes, if you tell nothing but the truth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Well, my lady, the poor young gentleman to be fureswore bitterly he was smitten;—by all the Gods, says he, she is one of the most beautifulest,—most youngest, and most elegantest creatures my eyes ever beheld!—but I, telling him as how she was positively engaged to colonel Staff,—then he began to curse.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Why presume to tell him so?—Who gave you knowledge of my engagements?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Hear the girl, sister;
<stage>(aside)</stage>
she's caught.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Do'nt be angry, madam,—I told him, madam—thinking no harm, and so he curs'd, and call'd on Heaven, and poor gentleman sigh'd so, that I took pity on him, and by his persuasions and promises brought him into the closet, where he was to have been concealed,—Yes, ma'am—'till I could have contriv'd to have brought you into the room, which I should have done, but that my lady first came, and then Sir Buzzard, who made up the noise that disturb'd the house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>You are an impudent girl, go wait in my dressing-room 'till my coming.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my lady,—but oh, sure, you do'nt intend to discharge me,—what could I do
<pb n="64" facs="70"/>
when so pretty a gentleman knelt to me, and cried to me for assistance—and squeez'd my hand, and forc'd a purse into my bosom—Oh! oh!
<stage>(crying, apart to the widow)</stage>
—you will speak to my lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>I will, Grace!
<stage>(apart)</stage>
there
<stage>(gives money)</stage>
—let me see you presently.</p>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Grace, <hi>laughing.</hi></stage>
<p>A pretty scheme this!—your maid, Lady Flippant, has used me well—did I ever make any positive engagements with the Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>La. Flip.</speaker>
<p>I hope not, but really you take such pains to torment each other, I was apprehensive you were privately married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Heav'n forbid!—I have been prudently considering the Colonel's situation some time past—his estate I understand has been long languishing in a decline, and his creditors no doubt are in expectation of mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>La. Flip.</speaker>
<p>Then to bestow it on Welford—think of the pleasure of sweet five and twenty smiling upon you from morning 'till night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mus.</speaker>
<p>And from night to morning—think of that, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>La. Flip.</speaker>
<p>Then our triumph over a girl of such beauty as Constance—the buz of the polite world, and their impertinent ill-nature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Certainly there are inducements.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>La. Flip.</speaker>
<p>Inducements! you will have the exquisite satisfaction of being lampoon'd, epigramm'd, and paragraph'd—or perhaps be etch'd in aqua fortis, and stuck up in the print shops. Then to have the tribe of antiquated maidens, disgusted wives, and disappointed widows railing at your prudence, yet envying
<pb n="65" facs="71"/>
your situation—"Lord bless us!"—ejaculates Lady Toothless, "I wonder at her indiscretion, to marry a man so young. The Colonel would have been much more suitable."—Then she takes five years from your lover's age, and adds to your's—"That's he!—that's he!"—exclaims Miss Squintum, as she ogles from a side box, with one eye worn out in searching for defects in beauty, and the other on the decline—"That's he,—but I cannot perceive what she saw in the fellow; he is as plain as herself—and I wonder how women can follow fellows."—The blooming youth hands you to your seat—the whole circle stare at you—a general whisper's breath'd round—you gaze in return with perfect composure—salute your acquaintance—adjust your tucker, giggle behind your fan, assume a perfect indifference, whisper your handsome husband to mortify them, and laugh out to shew your inward satisfaction and ineffable contempt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>But how is all this to be brought about?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mus.</speaker>
<p>Call at my house within an hour, and if I do not settle it, discard me from your confidence.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>She shall be punctual—come, sister, I see you were unacquainted with your lover's passion,—but you must acknowledge I had sufficient cause for suspicion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Yet you must allow there was no deceit on my part.
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Widow.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mus.</speaker>
<p>You have play'd your part admirably.</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> DOUGLAS, CLARA, <hi>and</hi> NICHOLAS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>You are no longer a Scotchman I zee—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Nicholas, I have only laid aside the tone and accent, but am still a Scotchman; I have no reason to be ashamed of my country, and I trust my country will never have reason to be ashamed of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Why zee master, I could never zee any difference between your English and Scotch; though to be zure I could hear it in their speaking, and that is the only difference I think should ever be between them; but take a fool's advice now,—make the best use of your time.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Nicholas.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>What employs your thoughts, my love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>In truth, love itself; if the pleasing description you have given me be true, and I have no reason to doubt your veracity, to live with those we love must be the extent of human happiness;—but then, Mr. Ordeal has told me that your sex often requite the most sincere passion with cold indifference.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>The charge is too true; but my affection can only cease with life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>I owe every thing to Mr. Ordeal's goodness, and the very arguments you urged to gain my love, persuade me against being ungrateful!—obedience is the only return I can make his kindness, and how can I disobey him, when my heart informs me that ingratitude is
<pb n="67" facs="73"/>
one of those heinous sins at which Heaven is most offended?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>It is true, no quality of the soul is more lovely than gratitude;—but Mr. Ordeal is not actuated by passion,—he offers you his hand from motives of generosity, not love,—all you owe him is friendship, which an union with me could not diminish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>You can persuade me to any thing;—you swear you love me,—I believe you,—and if the pleasure I take in seeing you, and hearing you, and the pain I feel when you leave me, be love, I love you above all things.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Re-enter</hi> NICHOLAS.</stage>

<p>Who, I, a spoil-sport! mum!—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Nicholas.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>Would not my consenting to marry you be injustice to my benefactor?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>The value I set upon your love is such, I would not accept it, but as the voluntary gift of your soul!—I will obtain Mr. Ordeal's consent.</p>
</sp>

<p>Then I am for ever yours.

<p>O, we are undone.</p>

<p><stage>(to Douglas)</stage>
Is this the way you repay my confidence? and you,
<stage>(to Clara)</stage>
innocent
<pb n="68" facs="74"/>
miss, is this a grateful return for years of kindness?—But
<stage>(to Nicholas)</stage>
what shall I say to you, rascal!—you, whom I thought watchful as a lynx, have slumber'd like another Argus—were your eyes piped into a nap by this Mercury, or was your mouth stopped by a sop, Mr. Cerberus?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I loves a sop;—but I will be called no names—zee master,—our bargain is this, a month's warning, or a month's wages; zo, pay me, and I'll go, but remember it was not I brought maister M'Classic into the house.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> NICH.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Your resentment, Sir, must fall solely upon me—I only have deceiv'd you,—a word in private,—
<stage>(takes Ordeal aside)</stage>
could human nature repel the influence of such beauty?—
<stage>(points to Clara)</stage>
had I been less honourable, or Clara less virtuous, I might now perhaps be imposing upon your credulity a seduced maid, with a vitiated mind: I am young,—Clara is pure nature,—the experiment I have made was dangerous.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>But you were only to have made the experiment to try how far her inclinations coincided with mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Consider, she was an orange tree.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>You were to have been the instrument for promoting my happiness.</p>

<p>Hear me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>The ripe fruit of autumn.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>And you would consider me the falling leaf in winter—hear me, Sir!—
<stage>(loud)</stage>
Have
<pb n="69" facs="75"/>
you not been urging the temptations of pleasure to seduce her into your own designs?—have you not alienated her affections from me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I came into your house for the very purpose of gaining her love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Who are you, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>A soldier—my name Douglas,—my fortune a competency,—my country Scotland—the same person who assisted you when attack'd by ruffians on Marlborough Downs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>The kind gentleman in whose arms I fainted!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>From the first instant I saw her, my soul caught the inspiration of virtuous love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>You are unfashionable, Sir,—from the dissipated conversation of the young fellows of the times, one would imagine there was neither honesty in man, nor chastity in woman;—but your conduct contradicts their aspersions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>It is too true, the arts of seduction are so sedulously studied, that honest love appears in danger of being extirpated.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>There are many, many melancholy examples;—but be assured, young man, though sensual pleasures arise from seducing innocence, it is plucking blossoms from a sweet-briar, which will rankle in the flesh.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Your observation, Sir, is just,—though it does not apply to me.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>"My censure does not fall solely on youth,—no, the gardens of beauty and innocence are also despoil'd by old debilitated wretches, who cannot cultivate the soil, but lay waste its beauties."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<p>Do you forgive me, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="70" facs="76"/>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>I blame you not, I am your debtor for many instances of duty and affection;—look on her, Douglas;—yet her beauty is the least of her excellence,—but as it is a principal part of benevolence to assist another most when there is most need of assistance,—and that you need not owe too much to the generosity of your husband,—as you cannot be my wife, I adopt you for my child—love inspires its votaries with sentiment, and I acknowledge the benign influence.
<stage>(<hi>Joins their hands.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>You weep, my lovely Clara!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>And so do you,—and so do I,—I see you are all joy,—but, my children, the transports of a virtuous passion are the least parts of its happiness,—we will this instant to Sir Buzzard Savage's,—a young lady, his niece, calls for my protection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>You mean Constance Heartfree! young De Courcy, of York, my particular friend, is, I believe, betrothed to her.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>You are right;—take your bride by the hand;—the women will laugh at me for losing her, but I am above the laugh of the world, and I will laugh at the world in my turn,—that is my way.—

<p>Impossible!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grace.</speaker>
<p>I am ready to take my oath of it!
<stage>(to Sir Buzzard)</stage>
the truth is, I told a great lie to your honour.</p>

<p>O, confound me, but I believe you now.

<p>The widow gone to Welford, on an assignation—ha! ha! ha! I will after her this instant, and cut his throat!—No, I will not stir—I am pleas'd—perfectly pleas'd!—I will discharge such a volley about his ears;—gone to visit Welford!—but why should I be vex'd?—I will follow her, spring a mine, and blow them up together—Burst on her like a hand-granade.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Ridiculous—you are all gunpowder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Well, you see it was your sister, not your wife, Welford came to visit; are you ready to make an apology for your vulgar suspicions?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>An apology to you! O, impudence! have you not been the rust of my health, have you not fretted me down to a mere skeleton?
<pb n="73" facs="79"/>
make you an apology!—give me my wasted flesh.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>I shall for London in the morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>If you dare!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Will shew out at every place of public entertainment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>At your peril.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>At your cost.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>The law gives me authority to confine you, and I will exercise it—I am your husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>I am heartily sorry for it! will have public breakfasts, public dinners, and public nights.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>You shall have bread and water, in a narrow room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>A box at the Opera, and subscribe to all the Concerts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>You devil!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Will purchase a new vis-a-vis—a town chariot and phaeton.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>You—you have a design upon my life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Heav'ns! how ardently I pant to be elevated in the phaeton, to take the circuit of Hyde Park, rolling in a cloud of dust, four horses, two outriders, whip in hand, flowing manes, hunters tails, sweep down Piccadilly, turn into St. James's-street,—up fly the clubhouse windows, out pop the powdered heads of the bucks and beauxs of fashion—some nod, some smile, some kiss hands,—all praise—she is a goddess, exclaims one,—a venus, ejaculates another,—an angel, sighs a third. I cut on, flash
<pb n="74" facs="80"/>
down Pall Mall swift as lightning, rattle furiously through Charing-Cross, overturn Lady Dapper's whim and cats at Northumberland House, lose a wheel in the Strand, leap from my seat as the carriage falls, and am received in the arms of some handsome fellow whom love has directed to my assistance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>She is mad! she is mad! outrageous mad!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>He carries me into a house, fainting—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Stop there; I will be divorc'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Then I will have a separate maintenance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Not a shilling.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>You cannot deprive me of my settlement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Ay, there is the grievance! O, confound all jointures and settlements, those encourage your levities, and stimulate you all to transgress.

<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I wait upon your ladyship, to return grateful thanks for the many favours you have conferred upon me, and to take my leave, as I am determined to quit this house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>What! without your uncle's consent?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I cannot think his consent necessary, while he and your ladyship assent to the persecution I experienced from a man I despise.</p>

<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Rising)</stage>
And pray where do you intend to go?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I have found a protector—Mr. Ordeal, the friend of my unfortunate father. Lady Flippant, it hurts my heart to part you upon those terms.
<stage>(<hi>Weeps and walks as going.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>In tears, Constance!
<stage>(Constance returns)</stage>
Why so distress'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>My heart is too full.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Be seated;
<stage>(they sit)</stage>
you love this Mr. Welford sincerely—but he is!
<stage>(aside)</stage>
what is it to me what he is!
<stage>(Rises)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>To me he is every thing—and it is my hope!—
<stage>(rises)</stage>
—but why should I hope?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Constance—I really love you—our manners have divided us; but be assured, my dear girl, though I run the circle of fashionable life, my mind is not devoid of sensibility—our education has been different.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>It was my happiness to receive instruction from a pious and tender mother, who early taught me the precepts of virtue, and impressed upon my heart, that a pure reputation with humble poverty, was preferable to a suspicious character, though blazoned with all the pomp and ornaments of elevated life—but she is no more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Rises)</stage>
Alas, Constance! it was my misfortune to be educated in all the giddy foibles and levities of the times.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Rises)</stage>
But I have observed a disposition in your ladyship susceptible of the tenderest offices of friendship,—and where there is feeling—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>There is hope of reformation—you would have said so—indeed, Constance,
<pb n="76" facs="84"/>
there are sentiments here, which often upbraid me; but sure nothing has transpir'd, injurious to my honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>The world is censorious, madam, and those whose conversation is the most entertaining are often the most dangerous; to simplicity they impute cunning, and give a criminal construction to the most innocent actions.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ORDEAL <hi>and</hi> CLARA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>I am all joy, Lady Flippant! Constance, this is Clara, hereafter I trust you will be inseparable friends.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>I shall endeavour to merit the lady's friendship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>They may boast of Queen Emma walking over burning ploughshares, but here is a girl has done more, she has lived in a fashionable family without censure.
<stage>(Takes Constance by the hand.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>But, Mr. Ordeal, what is the cause of your joy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>It must be disclos'd—Pure Nature has bestowed her hand and heart on the Scotch lad, who turns out to be Captain Douglas, Welford's intimate friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I know the gentleman, and he bears a high character.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Constance, take this young lady to the drawing-room, send Grace to me, and order your maid over to Welford's, to let him know you will be there presently. I have a serious reason for my request, and will not be denied.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I obey.

</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="77" facs="85"/>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>The poor girl's situation is truly pitiable—it was our subject when you came in—the tears are not yet out of my eyes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Never blush for weeping; tears are the certain symptoms of a noble soul.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Do you know that I have serious thoughts of throwing aside all fashionable levities?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>I know it is almost time; I believe your inclinations are virtuous, and your irregularities I do not impute to nature;—no, my lady, nature has endowed you with amiable qualities, among which, I think generosity is prevalent—like most of your sex, you have taken up levity through whim, and maintain it through habit, though perhaps your soul struggles to be delivered from the trammels;—break them, then, and you will do more than Caesar;—he conquered countries,—but the greatest glory human nature can acquire is to conquer ourselves;—I have good news for Constance,—her father is living.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Heav'ns!—are you serious?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>I have had letters from London, and he returns by the next ships from India;—nay more,—he has remitted thirty thousand pounds to her sole use, with directions to prepare a house for his reception.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>O, I am overjoy'd—why has she never heard from him before?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>He was sent upon an embassy to the interior parts of the country, and his letters were intercepted and destroyed.—But seriously, has your ladyship known nothing of this before?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Never.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="78" facs="86"/>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>There is roguery on foot,—an express was sent to your seat at York, which not meeting the lady there was forwarded to this city, and delivered at this house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>I see into it, this accounts for the warm impetuous passion of Cheaterly; the girl and her fortune were no doubt to be sacrificed, between him and my worthy spouse. Then you must assist me in persuading Constance to go to Welford; it will produce an incident which will punish the young gentleman's passion for intrigue, and give Constance an authority over him;
<stage>(going, returns)</stage>
but do you believe my repentance sincere?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>I hope so!—but I believe nothing without proof—that is my way—where there is levity the world will suspect, and when the world has once cause to suspect a woman, her character becomes as much the sport of its malice, as if there was a certainty of her having abandoned it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>I am penitent! but do you really forgive my lecture to Pure Nature?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and am convinc'd you are no false prophet; for, as you foretold, Clara preferred the summer dimples of youth to the winter wrinkles of age,—I speak my mind, that is my way.</p>

<p>Your opinion, madam, is just! vivacity is an attribute to woman,—gravity natural

<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>I must tell you the lover I would not prefer. I would not prefer a coxcomb,—a fluttering summer insect,—a talkative creature, full of insipid gesture, laughter, and noise, who pays more attention to his hair than to his intellects,—who possesses neither sentiment for friendship, nor sensibility for love—but is curst with a soul devoid of manliness, and bent on the gratification of its own puny affections.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>An excellent picture, yet the species of animal you describe are favorites.—The ladies are grown so enamoured of delicate limbs, and effeminate faces, one would imagine they wished to have their lovers women in every thing.</p>

<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>I am unconcerned at your suspicions, Colonel,—you will not be censorious, Miss Constance—my business here was to prevent that imprudent step which you are about to take.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>You have succeeded, madam
<stage>(<hi>going</hi>)</stage>.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Will you hear me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>I am sorty, Sir, for the confusion I have caused—having gained my esteem without difficulty—you have resign'd it with the same ease—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p><stage>(<hi>To the</hi> Widow)</stage>
This undeniable proof of your duplicity has reinstated my senses, and I will run the gauntlet no longer—you feel am calm—quite calm,—but I will have revenge;—you, Sir?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir!—it is my duty to clear this lady from suspicion, to which her situation lays her open, and in which I am innocently involved.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>You may have an interest in justifying yourself, Sir, but I request not to be included in your defence; I am going.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>I give up the pursuit—Madam, if my acts and deeds—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Your acts and deeds! Yes, I have heard of your acts and deeds from yourself, Colonel—but, be assured, a man without spirit shall never controul the acts and deeds of my fortune.</p>

<p>A true Parthian,—she shot as she slew.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Constance, will you attend to me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir,—you need not take the trouble
<pb n="86" facs="94"/>
of speaking to me now, or of enquiring for me hereafter.
<stage><hi>Exit.</hi> Constance.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Was ever man so unfortunate!—to have all my wishes blasted in the moment of ripening!—to lose the object of my love in the instant of recovering her—who waits there? to have an intrigue with a wife, a widow, and a maid, in the course of one day, and be disappointed in all—will nobody answer?

<p>What is the mater, Sir?</p>

<p>She went out with the Colonel.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>I speak of the young lady.</p>

<p>She left the house in a chair,—but I cannot tell where she went.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>What answer has Doctor Spruce sent?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>He said, Sir, he would not write,—but remember your ungenerous treatment, and have revenge!—pardon me, Sir, but these were his words.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Would have revenge?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, and I saw a letter on his table directed to Sir Buzzard Savage;—there was an
<pb n="87" facs="95"/>
attorney with him, and I heard him say the penalty is treble the money lost.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>How much is he arrested for?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>Upwards of seventy pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Here is a note for a hundred—
<stage>(<hi>gives a note</hi>)</stage>
fly and get him discharged.</p>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Servant.</stage>
<p>A letter to Sir Buzzard!—an attorney with him!—treble the penalty!—this Spruce I fear will turn traitor.</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> DOUGLAS.</stage>
<p>Captain Douglas, your most obedient,—how long have you been in Bath? I have not seen you for an age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>I believe, Sir, not since the York meeting, when my friend De Courcy lost his money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>He is too ardent to attempt play,—always off his guard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>And had the misfortune to play with those who kept a constant centinel upon his weakness;—he confided in you, and was deceived;—care, and a plain understanding, may preserve a man's property from the plunder of a common robber,—but honesty has no protection from the frauds of superior cunning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>I won nothing from him;—I lost—the truth is, the knowing ones took us in.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>But you shared the winnings—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Will you dare—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>I will dare any thing that is honest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="88" facs="96"/>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>Your friend, Sir, has dared to traduce my character, by the imputation you insinuate. But he and you should know me better, than to suppose any man could affront me with impunity.
<stage>(<hi>lays his hand on his sword.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>I know you have a mind capable of vindicating your conduct, even at the risque of your own life, and the life of him you have injured—men like you, habituated in deceit, become callous to humanity;—destitute of principle,—they are not deterred by the compunctions of conscience,—but will insure the profits of their cunning, even at the price of blood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>My family, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>Is honourable!—speak not of your family—their virtues render your vices the more conspicuous.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Sir</hi> BUZZARD.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Oh you traitor!—the reverend Mr▪ Spruce has made a full confession.—So I have been your pigeon, but the law shall do me justice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
<p>This is your scheme, pusillanimous, mean wretch—
<stage>(<hi>to Sir Buzzard</hi>)</stage>
for you, Sir,
<stage>(<hi>to Douglas</hi>)</stage>
we shall meet again.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Cheaterly.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Yes,—at the next assizes;—the fellow's mind is sowed with hempseed, and will yet produce a halter.—or if he escapes hanging, I shall see him perishing in a gaol, under as many wants as are in the Daily Advertiser;—have you been pigeon'd, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="89" facs="97"/>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>No Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>I have,—he has pluck'd some quill feathers from me,—he has pinion'd me!—oh the rascal!—but I shall recover my mortgages, and bonds, with treble penalties!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> WELFORD <hi>and Lady</hi> FLIPPANT.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Distraction!—she is lost!—I have been at your house, my Lady,—at Mr. Ordeal's—at every inn in the town,—but can get no tidings of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>It is surprising, you, who possess a heart open and liberal, panting with affection for the whole sex, should run distracted for the loss of an individual!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doug.</speaker>
<p>You overlook me, Welford—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Douglas!—my friend!—O, Douglas, I have lost my Constance!—I—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>No truant, I have been your advocate and regained her for you—on condition of repentance—.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> CONSTANCE <hi>and</hi> CLARA <hi>followed by</hi> ORDEAL.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>My life!—
<stage>(<hi>they embrace.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Repentance!—let him marry, and he will live and die in a state of repentance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p>What!—marry me, an orphan without a shilling?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wel.</speaker>
<p>Talk not of wealth,—were the riches of the world in your possession, by Heaven they would not add a grain to the estimation of your worth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Generous and noble!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="90" facs="98"/>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<p><stage>(<hi>to Ord.</hi>)</stage>
How, Sir, can I repay your generosity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>The satisfaction which results from aiding virtue in distress, is the only interest a generous mind can wish to receive for its services;—because it is the only interest such a mind can enjoy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>Return to my house;—there you shall be acquainted with a matter which nearly concerns your happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>Which I never expect to taste!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Your happiness is in your own power, commence the practice of virtue, and you will be enamoured of its sweets,—try the experiment, and never fear success.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Flip.</speaker>
<p>What say you to that, Sir Buzzard?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Buz.</speaker>
<p>I say a man can never be too old to mend—I say I have been positive all my life, and I say if you follow the advice of your ancient and sapient friend, my endeavours to procure domestic happiness shall not be wanting—Ordeal, the laugh will be against us both.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ord.</speaker>
<p>Laugh at me as long as you please, but had I married Clara, the laugh would have been still stronger against me;—the Scot has done right, and the girl has done right,—the mutual inclination of two virtuous souls, cannot but render them more virtuous;—the inhabitants of countries united by nature and policy should take every opportunity of strengthening the connexion;—I see you all think as I do!—and here I hope we shall also meet approbation.</p>

<head>EPILOGUE To FASHIONABLE LEVITIES.</head>
<byline>(As spoken by Miss YOUNGE.)</byline>
<sp>
<l>OUR growing Levities too clearly show,</l>
<l>That all our troubles from refinement flow.</l>
<l>Two ages since we valu'd plain attire,</l>
<l>Blue-apron'd was the Dame, straight-hair'd the Squire;</l>
<l>They call'd not houshold bus'ness vulgar cares,</l>
<l>Nor deem'd it ungenteel to say their pray'rs:</l>
<l>But arts improv'd, new Levities arose,</l>
<l>And Ladies chang'd the fashion of their clothes;</l>
<l>Hoop'd petticoats in ev'ry town were seen:</l>
<l>The snug rotunda pleas'd the virgin Queen,</l>
<l>And beef for breakfast serv'd her Lady-train;</l>
<l>No wonder that her sailors baffled Spain.</l>
<l>Yet still we've chiefs with love of glory fir'd;</l>
<l>But so had Rome when liberty expired;</l>
<l>"We've statesmen too, who burn with patriots flame,</l>
<l>"But so had Greece, when Greece had lost her fame."</l>
<l>"We've admirals who plow the briny deep,</l>
<l>"Through azure skies and rolling clouds they sweep,</l>
<l>"Invade the Planets in an Air Balloon,</l>
<l>"And fright from her propriety the Moon"—</l>
<l>Bess was a man, when danger call'd her pow'rs,</l>
<l>She was a woman in her private hours—</l>
<l>Few Levities, few luxuries she knew;</l>
<l>No cherries then in February grew:</l>
<l>May-dukes in April on the bough hung green,</l>
<l>And girls wore hanging-sleeves till full eighteen.</l>
<l>Few mothers teach their daughters grace or sense▪</l>
<l>But tell them taste in dress is excellence:</l>
<l>Bid them the Levities of rank assume,</l>
<l>And flaunt with spreading bow, or nodding plume;</l>
<l><pb facs="100"/>Strut in a riding-dress, to shew their shapes;</l>
<l>Or stalk in boots, and coats with tripple capes.</l>
<l>Affecting ease, but impudently free,</l>
<l>The matron leans upon her cicisbee;</l>
<l>While <hi>cara sposa</hi> snugly keeps his wench,</l>
<l>Defies his duns, and revels in the Bench.</l>
<l>"Why, this is vice, not folly?" I agree;</l>
<l>But still this vice proceeds from Levity.</l>
<l>Some souls there are which moral sense sublimes,</l>
<l>A few blest spirits in the worst of times;</l>
<l>One in whom birth and piety are join'd;</l>
<l>Of native worth, and truly royal mind;</l>
<l>Who with benignant hand her blessings pours;</l>
<l>Who knows no Levities, but feels for yours.</l>
