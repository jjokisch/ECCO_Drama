<head>PROLOGUE, Written and Spoken by Mr. GENTLEMAN.</head>
<lg>
<l><hi>BEN JOHNSON</hi>'s name, in ev'ry ear of taste,</l>
<l>Must with respect, and countenance be graced;</l>
<l>No pen the lines of nature better drew,</l>
<l>No wit or satire ever higher flew;</l>
<l>An early pillar of the English stage,</l>
<l>His pieces were true pictures of the age;</l>
<l>Time-worn they feel impair—yet still must please.</l>
<l>Nervous and just, though void of modern ease.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Fashions, in characters as well as cloaths,</l>
<l>Change, though less oft, as wav'ring fancy flows;</l>
<l>Witches and fairies with their midnight train,</l>
<l>No longer revel on the blasted plain;</l>
<l>Now ev'ry simpleton of britain's isle,</l>
<l>At such a fraud as <hi>Alchymy</hi> would smile;</l>
<l>Yet being only chang'd in name and shapes,</l>
<l>Scarce one in ten the gilded bait escapes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Haste to the hall where law is sold like ware,</l>
<l>How many long rob'd alchymsts ply there;</l>
<l>What hopes to gudgeon clients they unfold,</l>
<l>While empty quibbles turn to solid gold;</l>
<l>See swarming quacks!—so public folly wills</l>
<l>Convert to gold their health-destroying pills</l>
<l>Change Alley view—that scene of transmutation</l>
<l>That base alchemic bubble of the nation;</l>
<l>See beauty's self resign its brightest charms</l>
<l>And turn to gold in age's frozen arms.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="4"/>
<l>Search all the world, examine ev'ry part;</l>
<l>You'll find each man an alchymist at heart</l>
<l>In ev'ry clime we find, if truth be told</l>
<l>The universal deity is gold.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Whate'er of merit you perceive this night,</l>
<l>Grant your old bard as his undoubted right</l>
<l>My brain has laboured—feebly I confess,</l>
<l>Only to furnish a more modern dress.</l>
<l>My weak endeavours let your candor raise,</l>
<l>They hope indulgence, though they reach not praise.</l>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>AS the PROLOGUE has, in part, apologized for this alteration from BEN JOHNSON, nothing more need be added, but that it was meant to give Mr. WESTON's established merit in the character of <hi>Abel Drugger,</hi> more frequent, familiar, and compact opportunity of shewing itself, than the Old Play can possibly afford; upon comparison, it will be found, that very little of the original is retained, but a general idea, and the part of <hi>Abel Drugger,</hi> to which however, some additions have been made.</p>

<head>SCENE I.</head>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SUBTLE, <hi>followed by</hi> FACE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>NAY, nay, though thy name be Face, and thou hadst a face of brass, thou shalt not out-face me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Then must I be unable to handle a most excellent subject; tho' shame and thee have long since parted, I will so anatomize that calf's head of thine.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Calf's head! Blood of my life, I have a mind to mark my resentment in such legible characters upon that Tyburn visage of thine, as will put thy features in mourning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="7"/>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Come on then, see whose stomach will bear bruising best; I'll tickle those pampered sides.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>A poor, ignorant, impertinent, ungrateful wretch; whose life, to my disgrace be it spoken, I have saved—vile emblem of an empty cask, much sound, no contents, canst thou forget the mouldy crusts, Suffolk cheese, and dead small beer, on which thou wert starving in common with bare-ribbed rats and limping mice?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Mighty well, mighty well, master Subtle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Have I not made thee an occasional captain, am I not filling thy pockets as well as thy belly; have I not taught thee, dull as thou art, to converse with, and impose on various degrees of mankind? have I not from the stupidest slave that ever marred common sense sharpened thy wit, smoothed thy tongue, polished thy manners, regulated thy features, to make thee capable of thriving in life, and this treatment, my hopeful recompence?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Not so fast, not so fast, master glib-tongue, give eccho fair play—I do indeed confess myself indebted to thee for being a thriving pupil in the noble science of knavery, of which I admit thee an able professor; but as motives constitute, or destroy obligation, I ask what were thine? to strengthen and further thy own iniquitous designs; and if thou
<pb n="3" facs="8"/>
talk'st of favour I can bring a powerful balance on my side, to silence your modest worship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>With contempt I defy thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Nay, then my tongue shall so buffet thee, that thou shalt think half Billingsgate, the seat of thy education, let loose about thy ears, and shrink back that knave's face of thine like a snail into its shell.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Mighty fine!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Remember St. Giles's Scape-grace where I found thee a compleat emblem of poverty, resembling the fruit of a gibbet seven years exposed to wind and weather, not a coat to thy back, a stocking to thy legs, nor a shoe to thy feet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Very well, go on sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Did I not find thee tatterdemallion with a beard two inches long, not having wherewithal to pay a penny barber; squallid cheeks, furrowed brows, sunk eyes, and chattering teeth, crawling by the doors of cook-shops, to feed upon the steam of baked ox heads and shins of beef.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Tremble audacious villian at thy insolence—fear my rage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Did I not put thee into some liking, snatch thee from Jane Shore's fate, and when thou had'st not as much linen about thee as would furnish a tinder box, did I not like a guardian genius bring thee to this house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Yes thy master's house, which, like a hungry mastiff, thou wast left to guard, and for a single bone would have let in any thief.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Did I not enable thee to carry on the deceptions of alchymy, fortune telling, and algebra; your minerals, your vegetals, and animals, to fleece the credulous vulgar; have not I provided you with conjuror's robes, stills, glasses, furnaces, coals, and all other materials, to carry on thy profitable farce? answer me knave have I not done all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>And answer me miscreant, hast thou not thy share of the plunder? sirrah thou art as craving and unthankful as a Bumbailiff.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>And thou, poltroon, as tricking as a Jewish Stock-Broker, or an <hi>Old Bailey</hi> Solicitor.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Tricksy.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>How now my masters, I thought high words struck my ears; say what churlish point blows the
<pb n="5" facs="10"/>
wind from, to make such a gloomy appearance of foul weather?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Slave, there is no name vile enough for thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Call me any thing but Subtle, and I care not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>What tantrums are these I trow? I find my ears were right, some fiend has spread this mischief between ye, why ye look as black at each other as a dark Christmass.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>The dog is more hateful to me than cheese.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>And thou to me more detestable than the fulsome steam of a tallow-chandler's work-shop.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>For shame, talk not so loud, you will discover yourselves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>I care not, welcome pillory, or cart, so that varlet has his share.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Content, so thou art cropped, or hanged, first.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>Hey day, hey day, if you are for that sport have among ye; I must raise my voice too, then look to it; why you couple of paltry, pimping, petulant knaves cant we comfortably share gains and be
<pb n="6" facs="11"/>
quiet, cant we make fools without being such ourselves; what bring our golden scheme to so fair a prospect, and let it, according to your jargon, vanish in fumo—the old dispute revived, I suppose, about honesty, when you know in your consciences that there is not a grain in either of you, or if there was, you would starve by it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Why it is all his fault Doll.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>I deny it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>'Tis both your faults, you tinder temper'd knaves; you sputter at one another, and yet have as little courage as honesty, I know your high words and big looks, you spend your lungs to bawl, and strain your limbs to stride, without any meaning; what, am I a partner in all your undertakings, your impostures, and shall I waste my wit for nothing; must I encourage fools of various shapes, and assume as many different characters as Mr. What d' ye Callum, Protus, to forward your designs, that they may be blown up by idle passion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Take breath Doll—take breath.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>Take breath, 'ads my life, shake hands, live peaceably and cheat industriously, or tremble at my vengeance, I'll blow ye—get a genteel reward for apprehending such notorious bites; turn honest myself,
<pb n="7" facs="12"/>
and make those necks and ears you talk so lightly of, tremble at the approach of wooden and hempen collars.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Then let him leave off grumbling like a bear, that he has the heaviest part of our plan to execute.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>So I have; above one half the work, yet not above a third of the profit, besides ill language.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>And who begins it, old snarler, don't we perform the parts allotted us chearfully; if your's exceeds to-day, our's may match it to-morrow, s'death I have a good mind to pull you by the nose for this.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Nay but dear Doll—Doll the soft—Doll the gentle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>No wheedling, Mr. Morose, but swear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>What wouldst thou have me swear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>To leave idle disputation and high words, for industry in promoting our common cause, this will best become you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>By my hopes I meant no other; what I said was only to spur him up a little.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Ay but your spurs gall worse than those of a wild London apprentice, hack-mounted, to take the air on a sunday; they would make even the numbed sides of a sand ass shrink.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, no more, we want no whipping, nor spurring, take hands—no frowns but cordiality; I proclaim a peace.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Which for thy sake, fair mediatrix, I will keep religiously.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>And I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>I'll have no, no, Frenchified professions, fair faces with designing hearts—for my sake! keep the compact for your own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Wench of spirit, we will, and when we have stuffed our paunches, which, before our master returns we certainly shall, as a reward for thy pains thou shalt be lady Face, or lady Subtle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>Marry, come up I trow—a wonderful catch—suppose I should be neither, but of that hereafter is it not near the hour, when that Prince of simplicity, my sweet swain, the Tobaconist, is to be here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>It is, Face be thou in the way, to meet and conduct him to an audience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Fear not, I'll play the gudgeon with an angler's skill.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Why Doll, thou hast almost as many admirers as Hellen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>Admirers! if the frames were not gilded, the pictures would be intolerable; as for instance Abel Drugger, whose formality of phiz, and shallowness of scull, might for a few visits make even melancholly smile; then my slink-haired methodist preacher, Bawlwell, who wooes me in the stile of a saint, to make me in reality a devil.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! well said little volatile.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>Third that cumbersome repository of lewd thoughts, Sir Epicure, who batters my ears with such pomposity of phrase, that I should always have a dictionary at hand to understand him; he is, for mouthing, the puff'd up cryer of Cupid's court.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>He is indeed a rich subject for imposition; good wench, thou art to us as a conjuror's shew cloth to
<pb n="10" facs="15"/>
draw in the gaping croud; most of the sheep are penned by thee, and we fleece them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>Yes that you do pretty handsomely—but of all my numerous gallants I am most troubled with Headlong, the betting, boxing blade, and often fancy I stand in danger of feeling personally, by way of joke, the dexterity of his fists.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Hush! I hear somebody coming;—retire till occasion demands thy presence; and above all remember the feigned madness I have taught thee, for thy next interview with Sir Epicure—much depends on that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>Fear not—he shall think me fresh slipped from the region of Moorfields.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Now for suitable importance of look, and essential obscurity of phrase; by which the prudent are sometimes, and the foolish are always taken in.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> FACE, <hi>with</hi> ABEL DRUGGER.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>There he is—the wonder of the world—past, present, and to come, are as familiar to him as thou art with thy own face; there's not a fixed Planet, nor even a wandering star, beyond his knowledge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>May hap so—then he must have a power of acquaintances—I should not remember half of them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>You!—comparisons are—but mum—he turns upon us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>So friend thy name is Abel Drugger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Yes sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>And thou art a vender of Tobacco.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>True sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Free of the grocers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A Drug.</speaker>
<p>Ay an it please you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Thou art lucky—a good star reigned at thy birth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Mind that little Nab.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>I hope it was a north star—they say that's luckiest now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Thou hast an illustrious set of features.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Yes very lustrous—mother used to call me her bright baby Abel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="17"/>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Well—now for business—I know thy thoughts yet require thy own explanation—what wouldst thou have with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>This an please your wise worship—I am a young beginner, and am building a new shop, if it likes your reverence—it is just at the corner of a street—here's the plot on't; and I would know, by art sir, of your venerableship which way I should make my door by necromany, and where to place my boxes, where my shelves, and where my pots—I should be glad to thrive—I was wished to you by Captain Face here, my very good friend, who says that you known men's planets and their good Angels and their bad.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>He tells you a most solemn truth, I do know them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>I pray you Captain speak for me to Master Doctor, his wisdom has taken both my courage and breath away.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, I'll be thy spokesman—Doctor this is my friend; his name Abel—a very honest fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A Drug.</speaker>
<p>Yes very honest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>And no Goldsmith.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="18"/>
<speaker>A Drug.</speaker>
<p>No, no Goldsmith.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>And as I have already hinted very fortunate—at which allow me to rejoice—soft—metaposcopy informs me that your chesnut, or olive coloured hair does never fail; besides your long ears promise extremely well—you were born on Wednesday.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Good now—by my truly and so I was.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Is not this astonishing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>The thumb in chiromancy we give to Venus—the fore finger to Jove, the midst to Saturn, the ring to Sol, the least to Mercury.—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>(While</hi> Subtle <hi>is examining</hi> Drugger's <hi>fingers, he steals off a ring.)</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Nay, and you give them all away, I shall have none for myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Is not this strange.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Yes truly, very strange.—<hi>Missing his Ring.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Now for attention—this is thy house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Yes sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="19"/>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>And these are your two sides.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A Drug.</speaker>
<p>So they are indeed sir.</p>
</sp>

<p>I pray you sir write down these charms, for I have but a sieve-like memory—all runs though.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Fear not, I'll strengthen thy recollection, and give thee, for I like thy countenance, such other assistance as will make thee stand a fair chance to

possess that source of boundless riches, the philosopher's stone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Hearst thou that little Nab.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Ay, I do, good captain—what must I give the Doctor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Give him—consider thou art a made man—thou can'st not possibly give less than—but hold, that you may try his wisdom a little closer, ask him about any particular circumstance that happened some time since—see if he can tell.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>I'll do't—with your worship's good favour, I would ask what happened to me last Martinmass day was twelvemonth, at night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>I see thou doubt'st my skill—but I'll indulge thee, Aries, Taurus, Virgo, Sagittarius, Capricornus, whisper in my ear the event I am questioned upon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Are all these brother conjurors he's talking to?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Thou never wast at a tavern in thy life but on the evening thou hast mentioned.</p>

<p>Truth and no more I was not.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="21"/>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>There you was so sick—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>What, can you tell that too—ay, we had been out shooting water wagtails, and I had gotten a rare stomach—so eating a piece of fat ram mutton for supper, it lay heavy on my stomach, and my head did so ache.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>And Nab having no head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>No, no head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>You were obliged to be carried home where a good old woman.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Yes faith, she cured me with sodden ale, and pellitory o'th wall—it cost me but two pence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Wonderful cheap.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Was'n't it master captain, why, it was but last week the Alderman of our Ward died with eating too much, though his doctor's bill came to twenty golden gunieas—but I had another sickness worse than the ram mutton.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>That too I know; it was grief at being sessed eighteen pence for the water works.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="17" facs="22"/>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>As I am a true man, and so it was—ay, it had like to have cost me my life—'twas done in perfect spight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Nay, thy very hair fell off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Ay, and it has never curl'd since—every syllable true as I stand here, captain Face—I'll give him a crown.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>What!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Yes I'll give him a crown.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>A crown, I blush to think of it: what, after consulting so many stars, and obtaining such marks of good fortune, put the doctor off with a less fee than you must give for a pettifogging lawyer's letter—oh! shame, shame, what gold hast thou about thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>A two guinea piece, which was left me by my grandmother, and I would fain leave it to my grandchild.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw, Pshaw—give it to the doctor—nay pause not man, and the next visit make it ten—is it not a cheap purchase of ten times ten millions—mind that Nab.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="18" facs="23"/>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>Well, friend captain, since you desire it—but shan't I ask him for any change.</p>

<p>Not for the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>There then—so I thank your worship—I am your conjurorship's humble servant—
<stage>[Going]</stage>
—I had almost forgot—I would desire another favour of his worship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>What is that my knight of the steady phiz.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>That your doctorship will be so kind, as to be so civil, to look over my almanack, and cross out my ill days, that I may neither buy, nor sell, nor trust, upon them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>I promise this shall be done against the afternoon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>It shall—moreover, I will mark out a disposition of thy shelves, devise a sign, with other matters that may serve thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Rejoice Nab, thou art in high favour with the doctor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A. Drug.</speaker>
<p>I humbly thank your grace, and if your reverence comes near Pye Corner, you shall be welcome to

<p>Ha! ha! ha! thus grist flows into our mill—what think you of this tame pidgeon?</p>

<p>An excellent subject for imposition, and quite ripe for plucking; the stock is indebted to thee for bringing him to hand—at his next visit Doll shall ply him on another side, in the character of a rich widow—I must in, and prepare myself for Sir Epicure Mammon; do thou slip on the laboratory disguise, and watch his coming to the door.</p>

<p>WELL, my Zephirus, do we succeed, is our day come? Blushes the bolt's head?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Even with a virgin glow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Epic.</speaker>
<p>Excellent; now then Lungs, all my care must be where to get stuff enough for transmutation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Your worship must buy the metal covering from the roofs of churches.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Epic.</speaker>
<p>Thou say'st well, and instead thereof place thatch; thatch will sit lighter on their raftors, well after this day all that art can frame, or luxury can desire, is mine; I'll have a seraglio, to put the grand Signior's out of countenance, for where's that beauty can withstand a knight of gold?—my very slaves shall live on such viands as monarchs now call rarities; thy cares too, my Lungs, are near an end, this night I'll manumit thee from the furnace, and repair thy brain, hurt with fume o'th' metals.</p>

<p>I thank you sir; I have indeed blown hard for your worship.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Within sir at his prayers for the success of our great projection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Epic.</speaker>
<p>Good soul to pray so much, and toil so hard for my emolument; thou Lungs, when I have got thee into flesh a little, shall be my Kisler Aga, the keeper of my wanton nymphs, more fair than those who tripped the Cyprian grove.</p>

<p>Good morrow father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Gentle son good morrow—but wherefore here so soon, I fear me you are covetous, and wish possession of the stone for carnal appetite; take heed you do not throw the near hand blessing from you with ungoverned haste; I should be sorry to see my labour,
<pb n="22" facs="27"/>
now on the point of perfection, not prosper where my honest love has placed them, as they have been meant for public good; for pious uses, and mere charity—shouldst thou pursue ought else, a curse will follow thy deceitful ways.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Epic.</speaker>
<p>I know it, venerable sir—you shall not need to fear me, I will be charity itself; there shall not be an empty stomach, or a thread-bare coat, in the nation; I will build churches, endow hospitals, and make lean curates plump as fat metropolitans; I will give such premiums for virtue, that vice shall be ashamed to show its face; I will pay off the national debt, to annihilate the taxes upon salt, soap, leather, candles, and beer, which now gripe impoverished pockets, all arts, all sciences, shall thrive beneath my smile; and every comfort of life lie open to every hand, while temperance and doing good, to me, shall be the highest luxury.</p>

<p>Fairly spoken, if sincerity gives value to thy words—Ulen, look well to the register, and let your heat lessen by degrees, to the aludels.</p>

<p>Yes, by the token sir; the retort brake, and what was saved was put into the pellicane, and sealed with Hermes seal.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Epic.</speaker>
<p>What no more! a very trifle—good sir, what shall I give him.</p>

<p>Some twenty pounds, or you may make it five and twenty.</p>

this needed not, but you will have it so—now must I set the oil of luna, and the philosopher's vinegar in kemia—Ulen, go thou for the amalgama—son your leave a while.

allow me madam to offer up my vows with rapture at the shrine of your charms.</p>

<p>The vows of men, Sir Epicure, are false.</p>

<p>Your praise and favour, sir, speak warmly to my heart.</p>

courage, I'll lead the way from off this sky-crown'd rock, and headlong plunge into yon roaring deep—thou tremblest—guilt makes a coward of thee, and thou must remain a prey to self consuming flames; while white-winged doves wait to bear me to the fields of bliss, where such as thou can never, never, never, come.</p>

<p>How did you work her to this?</p>

<p>Ah there it is—knew you not her tender brain? once hurt by love and matchless modesty, dear good lady.—</p>

<p>Right, Lungs, coax her Lungs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tric.</speaker>
<p>Nay shepherds, cease your melting strains, they are all in vain—I have no heart to give—'twas stolen long since—what do you alter notes,
<pb n="27" facs="32"/>
and looks so soon?—worse than the ravens discord—black as the brow of night; oh, you can quickly change—but I defy you all—for at my beck, ten thousand spitits wait, to whom, this nether globe, with all its load of sins would be but a sportive toy, to bandy through unbounded regions of the trackless air.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rant.</speaker>
<p>A droll figure I vow—an admirable character for Mrs. Cornelys—well Mr. Conjuror, as I am told, you are very intimate with the stars, I am inclined for a little conversation with you, and that we may better understand one another—there are a few guineas.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>There is no language the stars understand, or like better than what these speak.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rant.</speaker>
<p>You must know sir, I am the happiest creature alive, in number, and choice of admirers; I have a soldier of spirit who swears to me, a smirking parson, who prays to me, a Puritan, who cants to me, a Jemmy wit, who rallies, a gamester, who prefers me to the four Queens, and a Patriot, who offers to sacrifice even liberty to my smiles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word madam, you at least have the pleasure of variety—but you'll soon be like Alexander, have no more to conquer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="36"/>
<speaker>Rant.</speaker>
<p>Oh its charming beyond expression; and though a little troublesome when the rivals meet, yet I would not be without a numerous suite of worshippers for the world—the delightful envy it raises in your sex, and the enchanting bustle it causes amongst the other—then the amorous manoeuvres of a glance to one, a nod to another, a leer to a third, a smile to a fourth, a beck to a fifth, a wink to a sixth, a sigh to a seventh, the tip of my little finger to an eighth, caring for none, and yet kind to all; is so Jantee, so <hi>alamode</hi>—so every thing, that I would not sacrifice my state of conquest, to be the matrimonial property of—of—no, not a Nabob, or an East India Governor hung round with diamonds—Husband!—insipid, drowsy, odious title.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>Give me leave madam, as I see the charms of your person, though, with the dim eyes of age, to enquire the beauties of your pocket; as thence perhaps, we may properly estimate the violent attachment of your numerous admirers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rant.</speaker>
<p>What? fortune you mean; that, sir, I am not ashamed to explain, having had these twelvemonth past, by the will of my good old grandfather, twenty thousand pounds, at my own disposal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Face.</speaker>
<p>Nay madam, it is not at all wonderful, that you should have an admirer for every thousand—besides being at your own disposal, the fatigue and
<pb n="32" facs="37"/>
danger, of a trip to Scotland are rendered unnecessary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rant.</speaker>
<p>True sir—at the age of sixteen, I was very near making that trip, as you call it—I was then at a boarding school, and listened to the soft sighs of Jemmy Goosequil, an Attorney's clerk; fond as Pyramus, and Thisbe, we agreed to elope—I got over the garden wall, on a sweet moonlight night, and posted as far as the river of matrimonial liberty, Tweed, when my surly fox-hunting papa, who loves a long chase at any rate, took me prisoner, horse-whipped my poor gallant, and brought me back, as melancholly as a turtle, separated from its cooing mate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Subtle.</speaker>
<p>I imagine Miss, you have since perceived, that it is necessary for parents to thwart the precipitate inclinations of youth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rant.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but not upon old gruff's principles—at sixteen, indeed, I was a fond, foolish, credulous, creature, and thought of nothing but flames, darts, constancy, and dying—if a young fellow looked but grave—heigho! I pitied him, but now, as lady Fanny Flirtem says, if an army of lovers was before me, with pistols at their ears, daggers at their breasts, running nooses round their necks, or poison at their mouths, I could look on with the most immoveable composure, the true unfeeling fashionable indifference.</p>
