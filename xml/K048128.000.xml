<p>THIS fellow, Lounge, sleeps till noon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JUDITH.</speaker>
<p>Aye, he sleeps all day. His master has a pretty servant of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPATTERDASH.</speaker>
<p>His master Young Sadboy, is beating his rounds; he no longer wears the broad brim of a Quaker; he has already been to one play, and begins to swear, Zounds! He is between the character of a Buck and a Quaker, in a continual see-saw of dissipation.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Coachman</hi> and <hi>Young Sadboy.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>COACHMAN.</speaker>
<p>My Fare is One Shilling and Sixpence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>I tell thee, friend, thee art paid. Thou art full of guile.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COACHMAN.</speaker>
<p>I full of guile! It is no such thing; I drink nothing but right good beer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>I will give thee a crooked bit of silver called a Sixpence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COACHMAN.</speaker>
<p>I will have my Fare.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>Another word, you rascal, and I'll break your pate!—Go, friend. <stage>[Exit Coachman.] (To Spatterdash.)</stage> Was there any gold or silver left in paper for me, or any one called for me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
<speaker>SPATTERDASH.</speaker>
<p>There was a gentleman who desires you would call on him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>If I do, damn me.—What, my servant asleep when he should watch? <stage>(Sees Lounge.)</stage> I will smite his Holofernes with the hand of Judith. <stage>[Strikes Lounge with the hand of Judith.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JUDITH.</speaker>
<p>You did smite him hard.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>Old Sadboy is arrived.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>Though my father would not suffer me to take Primrose's daughter in Philadelphia, as the wife of my bosom, because her father was gone off—but now I am in London, and as I have a tempting purse of gold in my pocket, I will take my round of pleasure. With the weight of much gold is my purse weighed down.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>Presently you shall see the weight paid of Araminta.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Do thou take my two horses from the stable, unto the leathern vehicle, and drive it unto the porch of my dwelling.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir.</p>

<stage>Exit.</stage>
<stage>Enter <hi>Pink</hi> and <hi>Spatterdash.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PINK.</speaker>
<p>Here is a letter from Araminta. Where is Captain Ambush? I must give it into his own hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPATTERDASH.</speaker>
<p>So you want to give this letter into his hand, that he may slip half a guinea into yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="5"/>
<speaker>PINK.</speaker>
<p>My mistress, I hear, will marry a rich man, if she marries your master the Captain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPATTERDASH.</speaker>
<p>What, my master rich! why he is only a Lieutenant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PINK.</speaker>
<p>Lieutenants and Ensigns they are called Captains. They are all great officers.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> AMBUSH.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PINK.</speaker>
<p>Here is a letter from Araminta.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<stage>(Reads.)</stage>
<p>Going to Chronicle's! how unlucky!—Where does Chronicle live?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PINK.</speaker>
<p>In Grosvenor-street.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>That is an odd place for a Stock-broker.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPATTERDASH.</speaker>
<p>Chronicle lives in the house in Grosvenor-street.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PINK.</speaker>
<p>What token am I to carry to my mistress?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>By the same token take this.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Kisses her, and Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PINK.</speaker>
<p>I know poor Spatt. has nothing else to give: but the Captain might have given him something else.—Well, ply us home with that, and I'll ensure you success.</p>

<p>My father never enjoined me to do any thing against my own will.</p>

<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> ROUNCIFUL.</speaker>
<p>Chronicle is a man of good fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
<p>It is much better to go to church with a young gentleman, than go hobbling there with an old one. It is sufficient where two fond hearts unite. <stage>(Sings.)</stage>
Gang down the bourne, Davy love, and I'll follow thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> ROUNCIFUL.</speaker>
<p>Your duty and gratitude should induce you to follow my advice.</p>

<p>My heart was ever swayed by duty and gratitude. I thank you for your past care of me; but prudence will lead me to be the guardian to my own happiness.</p>

<p>You are come over to see your friends, you say. I am sure you have one friend, and that is myself: you have no moneys—You was brought up in America, and was lest an infant, to the care of Old Sadboy, you say, and your name is Dinah Primrose—Is your father alive?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I believe my father is alive, and lives in London; his name is Primrose—I do not know my parents.</p>

<p>There is no subsisting in London without the cash—If you will go with me to my friend in the Old Jury, you must be mighty cautious. This is a wicked town; there are so many snares laid—I shall have her all to myself. <stage>(Aside.)</stage> Have you any luggage?</p>

<p>I see they are sumptuous in this entertainment. Here is Champagne and Burgundy; of these I will carry off three flasks—I have had a bottle of each since dinner.—Champagne is delicious— <stage>(<hi>Drinks</hi>)</stage>—But if I drink too much I may come to shame; I am cautious in making too free with the juice of the grape; I hate a man who tipples in company with the ladies. A man that is drunk to women is always displeasing. <stage>(<hi>To Sppatterdash.</hi>)</stage> When you see me making too free with the bottle, give me the wink.</p>

<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>I Will go court Araminta myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>I am determined to propose myself to her as Lieutenant Ambush, and in the mean time will send this letter to Lady Rounciful.</p>
<p>MADAM,<lb/>
My slight acquaintance with Miss Araminta will only permit me to address you in this manner for permission to pay my respects to the young lady, &amp;c.<lb/>
BELMONT.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>My wife, whoever I marry, must honour me for no title but that of an honest heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>I must call on Dinah, in my habit of Alexander the Great, as I go to the masquerade.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>You are sure of your love.</p>

<stage><hi>Lady</hi> ROUNCIFUL's House.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> ROUNCIFUL</speaker>
<stage><hi>to</hi> ARAMINTA.</stage>
<p>My late husband was always so willing to oblige, so ready at the tea-table, he was happy to serve the ladies; he had a smile to one, a nod to another, a bow to the third, a bonmot to the fourth, and a joke with fifth.—It was he that could do it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
<p>This picture of Captain Ambush must be of my Godfrey; he must be the original; "For a soldier he is for the ladies."</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SERVANT.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<p>Here is Mr. Chronicle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> ROUNCIFUL.</speaker>
<p>We are at home to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CHRONICLE.</speaker>
<p>Soon I shall be your dutiful son-in law; when the chaplain has read the ceremony, then on I go the happy journey for life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
<p>Did you say journey?</p>
<stage>(Sings.)</stage>
<l>Your journey I fear, will do you no good,</l>
<l>For you will wander about like the babes in the wood.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CHRONICLE.</speaker>
<p>I dare say she will make a very agreeable gallopping dreary dun. <stage>(Aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>Well said, my old buck. <stage>(Aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="30" facs="28"/>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> ROUNCIFUL.</speaker>
<p>You will soon have a right to her chamber. Why don't you follow her there? Take my word for it, she will not like you the worse for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<p>A letter to your ladyship. <stage>(<hi>Gives a letter to Lady Rounciful.)</hi></stage></p>

<stage>(<hi>Lady</hi> ROUNCIFUL reads.)</stage>
<p>"—wish for permission to pay my respects to your daughter, the young lady Araminta.<lb/>
I am yours, BELMONT."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> ROUNCIFUL.</speaker>
<p>This is a much more advantageous match for my daughter, than Chronicle—I must break this intended match with her and Chronicle.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> CHRONICLE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CHRONICLE.</speaker>
<p>Oh the knowing rogue, she would not let me in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> ROUNCIFUL.</speaker>
<p>Had you the assurance to follow my daughter to her chamber? What encouragement did ever you receive from her or me to warrant your taking such a liberty?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CHRONICLE.</speaker>
<p>Madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> ROUNCIFUL.</speaker>
<p>Sir, what have you ever seen in me or my daughter, to countenance such an intrusion? <stage>(Calls her servant.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> CLOD.</stage>
<p>Take notice that in future, that whenever this gentleman comes to me or my daughter, we are never at home to him.</p>

<stage>Exit.</stage>

<speaker>CHRONICLE.</speaker>
<p>Whew! I am not awake sure! Clod, come, and shake me by the shoulder, lest I fall into a lethargy. <stage>(<hi>Shakes him.</hi>)</stage> Are my eyes open?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLOD.</speaker>
<p>They are wide open.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Hit my back.</p>

<speaker>CLOD.</speaker>
<p>There and there. <stage>(<hi>Strikes Chronicle.</hi>)</stage></p>

<p>Now I believe I am awake</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Captain AMBUSH <hi>and</hi> Young SADBOY</speaker>
<stage>(<hi>Come forward.</hi>)</stage>
<p>When are we to wish you joy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CHRONICLE.</speaker>
<p>Don't torment me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>Why what has been the matter here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLOD.</speaker>
<p>Could you believe it, my master has fell into a fit of lethargy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>If Araminta is altered in her love by a title, she prefers me not for my sincerity. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ARAMINTA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
<p>My mother believes you are Lord Belmont. There was a letter came to my mother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="32" facs="30"/>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>That letter I signed. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
<p>He made proposals as Lord Belmont. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>If she fixed on the title instead of disinterested love, my hopes are blasted. Every hope of happiness is lost for ever. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage> Did you consent to give your hand to another?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
<p>I thought I gave my consent to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>My charming Araminta, you have too fond a partiality for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
<p>What, do you refuse me then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>In consenting to my happiness, you are the only person imposed on. I did this to prove the disinterestedness of your love—I am the person you would wish me to be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
<p>I would prefer being the wife of Lieutenant Ambush, to being the lady of the first peer of the realm.—Be you who you will, a lord or a lieutenant, I am happy in being your wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMBUSH.</speaker>
<p>Know, then, I am Lord Belmont—May the fate of every generous woman be thus decided.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
<p>And thus rewarded with the man she loves.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>CLOD.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I wish I could be a gentleman to a lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>My fellow is always out of the way—Do you live with Chronicle friend?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLOD.</speaker>
<p>I do not live with Chronicle, but I starve with him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>Is that the case?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLOD.</speaker>
<p>The case is good enough, but where is the lining—Lord, he would make a choice master for me. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage> Lord, Sir, what a bad servant you have. Sir, I am a very good one; I never would neglect a gentleman who would take me into his service; I never stay when my master calls.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>Did you ever dress an Alexander?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLOD.</speaker>
<p>Yes, twenty of them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>In this habit of Alexander the Great, will I visit my dear Dinah. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage> Help to attire me.</p>

<p>You will never be tired of me.</p>

<speaker>CLOD.</speaker>
<p>Did he not bid me bring something to him? It must be this hermit.</p>

<p>Here Clod.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CLOD.</speaker>

<stage><hi>to</hi> CHRONICLE.</stage>
<p>Doth my son Rubens walk with the righteous?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>CHRONICLE.</speaker>
<p>He walks and rides with lords and the best people in town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Old</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>What has he to do with lords?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CHRONICLE.</speaker>
<p>To be sure he might keep better company—He is pretty good.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Old</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>It was told me he went after vanities.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="35" facs="33"/>
<speaker>CHRONICLE.</speaker>
<p>He is a good boy, a pious boy, and a holy lad.—I must speak well of him, as he is to marry my daughter. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Old</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>Thou rejoiceth my heart.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Young</hi> SADBOY in the habit of Alexander the Great.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Old</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>Art thou my son Rubens?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>I am thy son Rubens.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Old</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>I sent thee over to England to transact business for the faithful in Philadelphia; hast thou been among the merchants and the tobacco sellers?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Old</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>Thou hast been among wine-bibbers and horse-racers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>Yea, I confess mine iniquities.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Old</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>Little did I look for this: I have cut him off with a shilling; that holy man! he is drest now to go to the wicked places about town.—You are feathered now, you are just fit to be tarred.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>I will be good, very good.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Old</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>I do lament my choler: I will forgive him.</p>

<p>Forgive him! but what will you give him?</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> DINAH.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Old</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>I will give him my vineyard, my house, my plantations, and my slaves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>I will accept of the house and plantations, on behalf of myself and my brethren in America; but as to slaves, I declare that every slave of mine shall henceforth be as free as air. Liberty shall no longer be considered as the peculiar blessing of England; it shall be extended to America; and may him only be deprived of it, who can make a slave of any one.</p>
</sp>

<p>Poor Godfrey is become your son-in-law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<p>Well, misers above all human beings are the worst enemies to mankind. How can he feel for others, who cannot feel for himself? The tear of sensibility can never have possession of his breast. He never does good to any, nor never gains himself a friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CHRONICLE.</speaker>
<p>I will be hanged but that is a good sermon, and costs me nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Young</hi> SADBOY.</speaker>
<l>Should future ills alarm,</l>
<l>Or innocence disarm,</l>
<l>May a faithful heart and wife</l>
<l>Prove the guardian genius of my life!</l>
