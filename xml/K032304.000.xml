<head>TO JAMES CRAGGS, Jun. <abbr>Esq</abbr> Cofferer to His Royal Highness the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Member of the Honourable House of Commons.</head>
<opener><salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>Do me the Honour to afford your Protection to these two <hi>Petites</hi> Pieces; I am sure none ever stood in more need of so generous a Friend and a Defender
<pb facs="3" ana="y"/>
as you are; tho' I dare not say they deserve this Benefit by any real Merit of their own, yet they have one Title to the Protection of all well natur'd People, which is, that they have Enemies undeserv'd, and were persecuted by those that did not know 'em.</p>
<p>If they had gone thro' a legal Course of Theatrical Justice, tho' it might have been partial, yet I should have submitted to it, as others had done before me; but to be prejudg'd and condemn'd unheard, was harder Measure than any body else meets with at this time a Day.</p>
<p>The <hi>Election,</hi> which had the
<pb facs="4"/>
Honour to pass your Approbation, was objected against as a Party - Matter: I fancy both Sides will agree that there are unreasonable Heats and Extravagancies belonging to each of 'em, which deserve to be expos'd, laugh'd at, and exploded by all true Lovers of their Country, since by such Arts, our Enemies find the way to poison our Constitution.</p>
<p>For the other, it was said there would be Offence taken at the exposing a <hi>Popish Priest.</hi> Good God! To what sort of People are we chang'd! Are those worthy Gentlemen (the Emissaries of our most avow'd and irreconcileable Enemy) to
<pb facs="5" ana="y"/>
be treated with so much Tenderncss.? Is not their very Profession Treason in any Subject of <hi>Great Britain?</hi> Have our Neighbours in <hi>France</hi> treated the Clergy of the Reform'd Religion with the same Regard? But let that pass, since they have their Friends and Advecates even here, I hope I have some too; it is not an unpardonable Sin with every Body to wish well to the Liberties and Religion of one's Country: No, Sir, I assure my self, you have Goodness enough to overlook a great many other Faults, where you find an honest and disinterested Zeal for our present happy Constitution.
<pb facs="6"/>
YOU, whose good Judgment ever engaged you on the right Side, the Protestant Succession, and the Interest of <hi>Britain;</hi> YOU who scorn'd to herd with the Betrayers of your Country, or raise your Fortunes on the Ruins of your Fellow Subjects; YOU who so generously espous'd my Interest, when you knew my Intention of dedicating to His Royal Highness, then Duke of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> will have the Goodness to protect a Woman who has no other Merit but her good Inclinations, and perpetual Wishes for the Prosperity of the present Government. These were Principles,
<pb facs="7" ana="y"/>
which, you know, she was not asham'd of owning, even when it was almost Criminal to pay any Marks of Respect to that Royal Family, under which our Laws and our Liberties are now so happily secur'd.</p>
<p>I wish, Sir, that you may find any thing in either of these little Comedies, that may entertain you at some leisure Hour. I know very well, that your Time is at present, too precious to be thrown away upon Trifles; that House of Commons of which you are so worthy, and so ornamental a Member, have the noblest and greatest Task now lying before them, the Vindication of our
<pb facs="8"/>
Publick Honour to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Extricating us out of such Difficulties, as only one Sett of Men in the World could plunge us into; but they will meet their Reward; and You, with those worthy Patriots engag'd with You, will find yours in the Thanks of the present Age, and the Blessings of that of Posterity.</p>
<p>I might here expatiate on the many excellent Qualifications You are Master of, did I not know it would be harder to obtain your Pardon for touching upon that Subject, than for presuming to shrowd these little Pieces under the Protection of your Name; besides, I think
<pb facs="9"/>
it needless at high Noon, to tell the World that it is light, since all that have Eyes, must see the Day; and all that have the Honour to know Mr. <hi>Craggs,</hi> knows his Character is above my Reach, consequently, would suffer from the Attempt of any Pen so weak as mine: Therefore shall only beg Leave to subscribe with the profoundest Respect, <hi>Sir,</hi></p>

<head>THE PREFACE.</head>
<p>WHEN I writ this little <hi>Farce,</hi> I was not without Hopes of having it represented on the Stage; what I propos'd to my self, was, the Honour to show their Royal Highnesses the Manner of our Elections, and entertain the Town with a Subject entirely new: It has had the good Fortune to please several Persons of Distinction, and Taste, in the Reading, and some of our best Judges assur'd me, it cou'd not fail to entertain from the Stage; but the Subject being upon Elections, the Master of the Revels did not care to meddle with it, and the Players act nothing without his Licence, so that I
<pb facs="11" ana="y"/>
had given over all Thoughts of its appearing in Publick. But the Word <hi>Election,</hi> it seems, immediately furnish'd out a Thousand scandalous Stories, and I was become the Subject of every Coffee-House in Town; and notwithstanding my Friends endeavour'd to do me Justice as often as they heard me aspers'd, yet for my clearer Justification, they were of Opinion I ought to print it, since several Persons had been so industriously malicious as to report that this <hi>Farce</hi> was a most impudent notorious Libel upon her Late Majesty; than which there is nothing more false, and the World will see how little Ground there is for such a Report; its so far from being a Satyr upon her, that there is not one personal Reflection design'd thro' the whole Piece; I was oblig'd indeed to make an Opposition of Parties, to heighten the Humour; it had been impossible to have writ any Thing upon the Subject without it; but I dare be positive, that the
<pb facs="12"/>
Persons among whom the Scenes lie wou'd have given more Diversion than Offence to the Spectators of either Party. I endeavour'd to make every Thing appear as natural as I cou'd, and for that Reason only, I stuck Wool in the Hats of my <hi>Whigs,</hi> and Lawrel in those of the <hi>Tories;</hi> tho' I wou'd be glad to know why the latter made use of the Lawrel to dislinguish themselves, when they were labouring to give up all the Conquests we had won: I should have thought a Sprig of Rosemary had been the properer Emblem of the then approaching Funeral of our Church and State, since the <hi>Chevalier's</hi> Friends were endeavouring to bury our Religion, and Liberty, under Tyranny and Popish Superstition. Had Parliaments been Part of the Legislature among the Ancients, and our Manner of Elections known to, and practis'd by them, <hi>Apollo</hi> wou'd certainly have shown Vengance on the unworthy Wearers of his favourite Tree:
<pb facs="13" ana="y"/>
The Lawrel was ever held the Emblem of Joy, and Reward of Vertue: Hence it was worn by Victors in the <hi>Olympick Games;</hi> but have <hi>Englishmen</hi> Reason to rejoyce in those Measures, that pav'd the Way for a <hi>French</hi> Government, and a <hi>Popish</hi> King?</p>
<p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers, who followed their Triumphs, were crown'd with Lawrel, to denote an Expiation of the Blood which they had shed in the Wars; but our Lawrel-wearers can draw no Parellel from thence, except deserting our Allies, selling our Trade, disgracing our Generals, giving up those glorious Conquests they had won, deserv'd to be crown'd with Lawrel, or that they wou'd be thought to wear it as an Expiation of the Blood of the <hi>Catalans,</hi> and of the Twelve Thousand cut to Pieces at <hi>Denain,</hi> by the fatal Cessation of Arms.</p>
<p>Whatever Reason they had for wearing
<pb facs="14"/>
it, I am glad they had not an Opportunity of making use of it, in the Triumph they design'd over the Laws and Liberties of their Country.</p>
<p>Here I can't omit taking notice how much the Popish Faction encreased under the traiterous Management of the late Ministry, and we see by their daily Insults, that 'tis at the hazard of Life or Interest, at least, that we dare vindicate our Religion, and Liberty. Had the Author of Lady <hi>Jane Grey</hi> made her a Papist, and <hi>Gardiner</hi> a Bishop of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Play been represented on the <hi>French</hi> Stage, what Protestant would have dar'd to call it a <hi>Popish Play,</hi> without running the Danger of the Gallies? If the Title of a certain Monarch, who was also set up by the People, in Opposition to the Right Line, were to be represented on the Theatre of <hi>France,</hi> not even the first Peer of that Nation durst to have vented one Murmur, much less his, without he were furnish'd with Philosophy
<pb facs="15" ana="y"/>
enough to endure the <hi>Bastile,</hi> and yet the Papists and their Abettors dare to do it here. It is with the utmost Indignation, that I see those wholsome Laws neglected, which ought to be put in Execution against such profess'd Enemies of our Church and State; for to the Indolence of our People in Power, are all our present Divisions and Distractions owing; tho' for the Author of that excellently writ Poem above-mention'd, I dare answer for him, is under no Concern for any Thing that Faction can either say or write, since 'tis very evident their Malice is not levell'd against him but against our Religion and Liberties, which he has in that Piece vindicated so well, and set the Cruelties of <hi>Rome</hi> in so true a Light, that a great Part of our Clergy may blush to see the Stage become a better Advocate for <hi>Protestantism</hi> than the Pulpit; and as oft as that Tragedy shall be represented the Author's Memory shall be honoured to Posterity, whilst those Pretenders to the Church, the <hi>High-Flying</hi> and <hi>Nonjuring-Party</hi>
<pb facs="16"/>
shall be remembred. with the utmost Detestation.</p>

<stage>Enter Lady <hi>Worthy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tickup,</hi> Gooddy <hi>Gabble,</hi> and Gooddy <hi>Shallow.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Never fear my dear <hi>Tickup,—</hi>as far as my Thousand Pound goes I'll stand by you, I'll spend it every Shilling but carry my Point; I hate a Whig so much, that I ll throw my Husband out of his Election, or throw my self out of the World; a Parsel of canting Rogues; they have always Moderation in their Mouths,—rank Resistance in their Hearts,—and hate Obedience even to their Lawful Wives,—and then they bear a Mortal Hatred to Three Pound Fourteen and Fippence!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tick.</speaker>
<p>Ay, they hate all Coin that won't take their Impression.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Why there's my Brute of a Husband now, he hates the <hi>French</hi> so much, that he won't let poor <hi>Fanny</hi> learn to dance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Good. G.</speaker>
<p>Nay my Husband is a little poison'd that Way too;—will you believe it,
<pb n="33" facs="26"/>
Madam, he had the Impudence to forbid me Dancing with your Honour's Worship last Night;—he said Dancing was a bold Recreation, and that it was an Inlet to Sin;—but I pluck'd up a Spirit, and told him I wou'd do it, that I wou'd dance, and dance agen, so I wou'd,—od my Gentleman was soon snub'd, for he knew an he rais'd my Passion once, he wou'd have enough to do to get it down again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Good. S.</speaker>
<p>Well, an I zay but one Word to <hi>Timothy Shallow,</hi> down goes Thimble and Shears,—and up he takes Gloves and Stick, and away goes he.—Ah, you're a happy Woman, Gooddy <hi>Gabble,</hi> your Husband is a Man every Inch of him, I'll zay that for him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Good. G.</speaker>
<p>You'll say that for him; Pray how come you to know what Man my Husband is, Gooddy <hi>Shallow</hi>? Have you found him a Man for your Business, ha?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Good. S.</speaker>
<p>I, I found your Husband a Man for my Business, I have a Husband as fit for Business as yours;—and tho' I zay it, that shou'd not zay it, there is not a better Workman in the Parish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tick.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, they are both good Workmen enough in their Way; she only jested with you, that's all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay Neighbours nothing else,—well, you'll use your Endeavours with your Husbands to give their Votes for Mr. <hi>Tickup.</hi></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Ay, I'll pass my Word for't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>G. Gab.</speaker>
<p>I thank your Ladyship,—not that I doubt your Word Madam, or the bountiful Squire's in the least;—but, but, but, an, an the Squire wou'd advance a Years Sallery aforehand, it wou'd go a great Way with my Husband;—for you must know, that <hi>Gregory Gabble</hi> is an honest Man, and won't vote against his Conscience, if it were not for his Interest;—now Sir <hi>John,</hi> you know Madam, promises to renew his Lease <hi>Gratis,</hi> if he votes for him, but an he votes against him, he won't bate him a Groat so he won't, you know your Husband's Temper, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Oh prithee name him not, you'll give me the Vapours; there, there's Twenty Pound for you, let me hear his odious Name no more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tick.</speaker>
<p>Take Notice <hi>Gooddy Gabble,</hi> those Twenty Pounds are to pay for nursing of a Child that shall be born,—no Matter when.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>G. Gab.</speaker>
<p>No, no, no, no Matter whether ever or never, I'll take it when you send it, sure sweet Squire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tick.</speaker>
<p>It is not out of any Sinister End to suborn your Husband, no, I scorn it, I am
<pb n="35" facs="28"/>
an honest Man, and a Lover of the Church, and will take Care the Roguish Whigs don't pull down a Hassock in't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Ay Neighbours, Mr. <hi>Tickup</hi>'s a Good Churchman, mark that! He is none of your occasional Cattle, none of your hellish Pantile Crew;—Oh we shall never thrive till all these canting Whigs are whipt out of the Kingdom;—Oh that I had the Jerking of'em, I'de teach 'em Passive-Obedience, or make the Devil come out of 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>G. Shal.</speaker>
<p>Well, your Ladyship is a very wise Woman, that's certain: Good lack, how she doth talk, Neighbour Gabble?—Oh she's a great Woman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Ay, and you shall be a great Woman too, Gooddy <hi>Shallow,</hi> if Mr. <hi>Tickup</hi> carries the Day; well, I'll say no more, but every Body don't know Mr. <hi>Tickup</hi>'s Power;—but there's a certain great Prince, that shall be nameless, that has a very great Kindness for him, and for ought I know he may stand as fair for a Garter as the best of'em, one Day.</p>

<speaker>G. Shal.</speaker>
<p>Pray Squire, will you be so kind as to recommend my <hi>Tim.</hi> to that same Great Prince, to be his Tailor?</p>

<p>Right;—Come here's to your Fireside, Mr. <hi>Mallet,</hi> I suppose you are a marry'd Man.</p>

<p>Sir, your humble Servant, a dare say he'll accept of your kind Offer, and thank you too.</p>

<p>Is he all the Children you have, Mr. <hi>Mallet</hi>?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="40" facs="33"/>
<speaker>Mall.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, I have four Sons and three Daughters in all, fine young Men and Women as any in the Parish, no dispraise to the best. My eldest Son is a Lawyer, just out of his time, a smart young Fellow, I promise you, Sir. My second I brought up to my own Trade, and he is a very great Master of his Business, tho' I say't, as any is in all <hi>Gotham.</hi> My third Son is a Bookseller, a notable Fellow, he lives in <hi>London;</hi> he is a kind of a Wit; too, they say, and makes Verses; then he has an admirable Knack at quacking Titles. Perhaps you may know what that is, Sir, but for my part, I do not, I confess, understand it; but they tell me, when he gets an old good for nothing Book, he claps a new Title to it, and sells off the whole Impression in a Week.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tick.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a good way of imposing on the Publick, why he'll be a rich Fellow in a short time?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mall.</speaker>
<p>Ay, so they say; but my youngest Lad troubles me most of all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pick.</speaker>
<p>How so, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mall.</speaker>
<p>Why you must know, Sir, he is a main weakly Boy, he had the Rickets till he was seven Years old, which took away his Strength, and hugely dull'd his Memory; so that he's dull, very dull, Sir; I can't think what to breed him to, that don't require much Strength of Body, nor Application of
<pb n="41" facs="34"/>
Mind: His Mother is for making him a Parson, but the Rogue won't hear on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tick.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Mr. <hi>Mallet</hi>! by your Description, he is very unfit for a Parson.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mall.</speaker>
<p>Why so I tell her, Sir, and in my Opinion we had better get him a Place at Court.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tick.</speaker>
<p>Ay, there indeed you are in the right; I don't know but I may be able to serve you there, if you'll endeavour to put it in my Power.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mall.</speaker>
<p>As how pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tick.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, you must know, I stand one of the Candidates for this Borough of <hi>Gotham;</hi> and if you'll be so kind to give me your own Vote, and engage your Friends to do the same, I'll take care of your Son, I promise you.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tick.</speaker>
<p>Why do you think so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mall.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, our Town has an Aversion for the Family of the <hi>Tickups;</hi> it is a Name very much hated I assure you, an I might advise you, I'd change it into Ready Cash, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tick.</speaker>
<p>You are witty upon my Name, Mr. <hi>Mallet;</hi> but no matter for that, what will you lay I don't carry't? I'll hold you twenty

Guineas to one I do, and you shall hold Stakes.</p>

<p>Oh softly by all Means.—First, den, he tell you here, dat de Knight of de Draggon give his most humble Service to you. and prays you to take a de care to make de good Members for him.</p>
</sp>

<p>Ay, ay, I will do all that in me lies.</p>

<p>And for dat purpose, you shall receive one, two, three hundred Pistoles, in one, two, three Days ma foy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>May.</speaker>
<p>Very well, very well;—pray let him know that the last Money that was remitted, has been prudently employ'd for the Chevalier's Service: Our Parson Blow-Coal is right Stanch, he distributed it, with a strict Charge to have Regard to the Church; the Noise of the Church, you know, does much, Monsieur?—My Brother, Alderman Credulous had two hundred Pounds.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Friend.</speaker>
<p>Humph, well said Parson; this News shall to Sir <hi>Roger Trusty</hi> <stage>(aside)</stage> ha, ha, ha, Begar, dat will do de Business; de

<speaker>Alderman.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, I can but laugh to think how my Wife's Brother, the Mayor, has over-reach'd his Daughter.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="56" facs="49"/>Enter <hi>Sir</hi> Roger Trusty.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Roger.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Alderman <hi>Credulous</hi>! your most humble Servant, Sir, I'm glad to see you so merry; Pray what may be the Occasion?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Family Affairs, Sir <hi>Roger;</hi> my Brother has dispos'd of his Daughter,—that's all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>Humph! not as he expected; tho' I believe, for her Advantage, I hope. <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> we Fathers know what's good for our Children, better than they do themselves; they have nought to do but to submit to our Pleasures; Passive Obedience is as absolutely necessary in our Wives and Children, as in Subjects to the Monarch; is not your Opinion the same, Sir <hi>Roger</hi>?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>Yes, whilst Husbands, Fathers and Monarchs exact nothing from us, contrary to our Religion and Laws: But pray, Mr. <hi>Alderman,</hi> How came you so passive? I remember you wore other Principles in Eighty Eight;—this is not natural, <hi>Alderman.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Eighty Eight! that's a long time ago; I know some Men that have worn out twenty Setts of Principles since Eighty Eight, both Men of the Robe, and Men of the Gown.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>More the pity, <hi>Alderman,</hi> I am sorry Nature did not distinguish Men of such Principles from the rest of her Handywork,
<pb n="57" facs="50"/>
that we might enjoy her Gifts more amply, and be more thankful for the Blessings. When I reflect that I am of the same Species with the Betrayers of my Country (for sure that Crime is the greatest of all others) I could almost wish to wear any other Form of the Creation. Life is a Blessing, or a Curse, according to the Fame we purchase, and he that redeems twenty of his Fellow Creatures from the slavish Yoke of Tyranny, does an Action worthy of a Man that bears the Image of his Creator, whilst he who seeks by Treachery to inslave his Kind, to feed Ambition, Avarice, or Revenge, is only the Pest of human Society, and ought to have a Mark set upon him, that we might shun him as we would the Plague.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, so it ought to be, Sir <hi>Roger;</hi> but I have read somewhere, <l>Nature to Man's Breast has made no Windows,</l>
<l>To show us what they act within Doors.</l></p>
<p>For my part, I am for the Church, and my Country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>So am I; their Interests are inseparable; who gives up one, betrays the others: For my part, I intend to stand or fall by both; therefore I hope you'll do me the Honour of your Vote, Mr. <hi>Alderman.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Why truly Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> I am pre-engag'd, I won't tell a Lie for the Matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>To who, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="58" facs="51"/>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Why to Squire <hi>Tickup.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p><hi>Tickup!</hi> Why he's a Fellow not worth a Groat, and a known <hi>Jacobite.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Nay, look ye as that, his Means and his Religion is nothing to me, let his Creditors take care of one, and our Parson o' th' t'other; for my part, I'm for the Church, as I said before, and would rather be a Papist than a Presbyterian.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>Why, where's the Necessity of your being either? Come, come, there's a more convincing Argument than what you have nam'd;—Mr. <hi>Tickup</hi> is recommended by some great Man on whom you have Dependance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Great Man! Why yes, truly, he is a pretty large Man; and I have, I trust Heaven, very great Dependance on what he says: The Parson of the Parish, you know, ought to be regarded, Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> and he told me that Mr. <hi>Tickup</hi> was a good Churchman, and pray'd me to vote for him, and to get all my Friends to do the same, if I would promote the Interest of the Church.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>Ay, the Interest of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not that of <hi>England;</hi> why I'll undertake to prove this Fellow deep in the Interest of young <hi>Perkin,</hi> and that he and his Friend, at <hi>Villa Coumbe,</hi> has bought up, and sent for his Service, more than 2000 Horses within these last four Years; and can such a Man be a proper Person to represent you in that August
<pb n="59" facs="52"/>
Assembly, where the People of <hi>Gotham</hi> expect to have these pernicious Measures redrest?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Why I am confounded at what you tell me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>I am amaz'd to find you in the Interest of the High-Boys, you that are a Cloathier! What, can you be for giving up Trade to <hi>France,</hi> and starving poor Weavers?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Trade, pish, pish, our Parson says that's only the Whigs Cant, and that if the Bill of Commerce had pass'd, it wou'd have been of signal Service to us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>Which Way, I pray, Alderman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I never askt him that, tho' no Doubt but he can tell you, for he is a learn'd Man, and understands Matters better than I do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>It is much to be wish'd for the Honour of our Religion, and the Safety of our State, that those learned Men were more industrious in the Cure of Souls, and less busie in Politicks.—But come come, Mr. <hi>Alderman,</hi> there is yet a Secret behind the Curtain, Pray what cou'd Mr. <hi>Tickup,</hi> or any of his Friends oblige you with, that is not in my Power to have done:—You and I have been good Friends, and if a Brace of Hundreds had been wanting,—why, we cou'd have serv'd you as well as they.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>So, so, I find whereabouts you are
<pb n="60" facs="53"/>
already. Well, there is nothing kept a Secret in this damn'd Town: However I had not those Two Hundred Pounds by Way of Bribe, I assure you Sir <hi>Roger.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, why then you had Two Hundred Pounds?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>Yes I confess, Mr. <hi>Blowcoal</hi> our Parson did give me Bills for Two Hundred Pounds, Part of a Sum, he said, that was given him for charitable Uses, and bad me dispose of it to proper Objects, as I thought fit, but not to bribe Votes I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rog.</speaker>
<p>No, no, no, no, 'twas to build Churches I suppose, and reward Secret Merit, ha, ha, ha, ha, but I am sorry for your Sake, that they made their Payment in Paper:—Pray let me see those Bills,—who are they upon?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ald.</speaker>
<p>See them! Ay,—there they are, Sir <hi>Roger.</hi> <stage>(Gives him Bills.</stage></p>
