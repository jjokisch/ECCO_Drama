<p>THE LAW OF LOMBARDY; A TRAGEDY: AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</p>

<head>TO THE KING.</head>
<opener><salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>YOUR Majesty's having graciously permitted me to prefix your royal name to this tragedy, has impress'd me with so deep a sense of the honor, that I despair of finding terms sufficient to express my acknowledgments.</p>
<p>Tho' the public, which is seldom disposed to receive favourably, performances destitute of merit, has been pleased to give this a very indulgent reception, I must still regret its imperfections, when I consider that it may for a moment become the object of your Majesty's attention. Having omitted nothing in my power to render it not entirely unworthy of such an exalted patronage, I can't forbear to flatter myself, that it may raise in the breast of your Majesty those emotions which well imagined distress never fails to excite in the noblest natures: but at the same time I more anxiously wish, that no other uneasiness but from such fictitious sorrow may ever approach you; and that the greatest and most amiable sovereign in Europe, may be also for ever distinguished as the most prosperous and happy.</p>
<closer><salute>I am, SIR,</salute>

<stage>BIRENO, ALINDA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>I Wonder not you should suspect me slow</l>
<l>In this strange office: had you but enjoin'd me,</l>
<l>Shut out the sun ten times his annual rounds,</l>
<l>Feed all my life on pulse, or with coarse weeds</l>
<l>Obscure the little grace which Nature's hand</l>
<l>Has lent my outside, then, without a wherefore,</l>
<l>(From the meek humbleness of love I bear you)</l>
<l>My obedience wou'd have follow'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>Sweet impatience,</l>
<l>Smooth that contracted brow—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>But to commend</l>
<l>To any other woman, those fond vows</l>
<l>I hop'd to own unpartner'd, is it less</l>
<l>Than to expect my tongue suborn'd, should plead</l>
<l>Against the dearest interest of my life,</l>
<l>And make me earnest for my own undoing?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>Must I again call down the saints to witness,</l>
<l>That for convenience only, not from love,</l>
<l>I seek to wed the princess? My ambition</l>
<l>Aims at the crown, her dower; were that bright gem</l>
<l>Heir'd by a pigmy, the meer mock of sight,</l>
<l>By ideot drawling, and a shrew's perverseness,</l>
<l>No less shou'd I desire it. If I prosper,</l>
<l>My heart, as ever, shall be thine; and hers,</l>
<l>The dull legitimate languor of the husband.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>But when to royal state Sophia joins</l>
<l>Such rare endowments, as make doubtful strife</l>
<l>'Twixt Nature's gifts, and Fortune's; can I hope</l>
<l>More than some grateful note from memory,</l>
<l>How much Alinda lov'd you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>Trust me, fair one,</l>
<l>Beauty's degrees are in the lover's fancy,</l>
<l>Not in a scal'd perfection. Varying nature</l>
<l>Has lineaments for every appetite:</l>
<l>Not her arch'd brows, nor stature Juno-like,</l>
<l>Her crisped tresses spun from finest gold,</l>
<l>Nor the intelligent lustre of her eye,</l>
<l>To me have half such charms as thy soft mien,</l>
<l>The pure carnation of thy dimpling cheek,</l>
<l>And unassuming sweet simplicity.—</l>
<l>But hast thou urg'd my suit?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>Spite of ourselves,</l>
<l>The tongue interprets from the abundant heart.</l>
<l>Bireno's image filling all my thoughts,</l>
<l>Cou'd I be silent on a theme so lov'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>And how does she receive the gentle tale?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>Sometimes she chides, and sometimes smiling tells me,</l>
<l>But that she knows me wise, such lavish praise</l>
<l>Might hint a heart touch'd deeply, and ill suits</l>
<l>The sober preference of an humble maid,</l>
<l>Who cannot hope to call you hers in honour.</l>
<l>Then with discreetest lessons will she school me,</l>
<l>To guard my breast 'gainst love; forgetting still</l>
<l>How much she wants the counsel she bestows.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>Does she then love?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>She never told me so;</l>
<l>But signs far more significant than speech</l>
<l>Reveal it hourly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>Let me know my rival,</l>
<l>Tho' my foreboding heart already whispers</l>
<l>It must be Paladore.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>Oh, rightly guess'd!</l>
<l>Her love for him makes her unjust to you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>Curses o'ertake him! Near his brighter fires</l>
<l>My star shines dimly; I was wonder'd at</l>
<l>Till this new meteor shot across men's eyes,</l>
<l>And drew all gaze to follow. At our tournaments</l>
<l>He foils me like a novice; in grave council</l>
<l>I prate unmark'd, while hoary heads bow down</l>
<l>In reverence to his weighty utterance;</l>
<l>And thus the upstart heresy of opinion</l>
<l>Runs on this smooth impostor—By what signs</l>
<l>Take you this note of her affection towards him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>By such we women deem infallible.</l>
<l>If unexpectedly she hears him nam'd,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="7"/>Sweet discomposure seizes all her frame;</l>
<l>Suffasion, softer than Aurora's blush,</l>
<l>Spreads o'er her beauteous cheek. If she expect</l>
<l>His presence at the court, studious to please,</l>
<l>Beyond her wonted elegance of dress,</l>
<l>With nicer care she counsels at her glass,</l>
<l>To make the daintiest workmanship of nature</l>
<l>By ornament more winning.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>Indications</l>
<l>That speak, and shrewdly; yet their vanity</l>
<l>To catch the flattery of the fool they scorn,</l>
<l>Will bait such hooks as these. Have you no proof</l>
<l>More unequivocal?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>What wou'd you more?</l>
<l>We reason from ourselves, looking within,</l>
<l>We find in our own breasts the according springs</l>
<l>Of motions similar; when first I lov'd,</l>
<l>So did I wish to please, so doubt my power.</l>
<l>Yet more than this; her eye still follows him,</l>
<l>And when the unwelcome hour of parting comes,</l>
<l>The chearful flame that lighted up her countenance</l>
<l>Expires; sighs heave, and a soft silent tear</l>
<l>Steals down her cheek.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>Enough, I'm satisfied</l>
<l>She loves him, and the frost of my reception</l>
<l>Conspires in proof. Now then, my best Alinda!</l>
<l>You must assist me; on this single push</l>
<l>Hang all my fortunes—If my rival wed her,</l>
<l>Farewel my hopes, my country—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>How! your country!</l>
<l>A voluntary exile for the loss</l>
<l>Of one you swear you love not—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>My possessions,</l>
<l>The means of pleasure to my thriftless youth,</l>
<l>Moulder in confiscation; thus my dukedom,</l>
<l>My royal ancestry, and rank in the state,</l>
<l>So scantily supported will but mock me.</l>
<l>A marriage with the princess wou'd heal all.</l>
<l>But if I fail, I will not stay to see</l>
<l>Upstarts made rich by my inheritance;</l>
<l>Nor the proud finger of the slave I scorn</l>
<l>Point at the princely beggar.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>Oh, good heaven!</l>
<l>Devise, command—Can my best industry</l>
<l>Prevent this ruin? Tell me but the means,</l>
<l>And bid me fly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>No more of jealousy,</l>
<l>But with appliance dext'rous call her thoughts</l>
<l>To me, and my deservings; speak with slight</l>
<l>(Yet not as by suggestion) of my rival.</l>
<l>I've known more way made in a woman's grace</l>
<l>By such confederate arts, than could be won</l>
<l>By a long siege of amorous enginry,</l>
<l>Soft flatteries, sighs, protestings infinite,</l>
<l>And all the fervor of impatient love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>But should this fail!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>I'll spread a finer snare,</l>
<l>Subtle as fabled Vulcan forg'd in Lemnos,</l>
<l>To enmesh them: thy soft hand, my dear Alinda!</l>
<l>Must help to hold the toils—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALINDA.</speaker>
<l>But see, she comes;</l>
<l>The king too and her lover—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>I'll retire,</l>
<l>And seek thee presently: rivet thine ear</l>
<l>Meantime to what they utter: thy report</l>
<l>Shall somewhat shape my course. High-flighted fool!</l>
<l>Check thy bold soaring, else my hot revenge</l>
<l>Shall melt thy waxed plumes, and hurl thee down</l>
<l>To a devouring sea that roars beneath thee.

<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>You shall no more, Sophia, to the chase;</l>
<l>This morning's danger makes my blood run cold.</l>
<l>Had not thy well-sped lance, brave Paladore,</l>
<l>Pierc'd the huge boar that gor'd her foaming horse,</l>
<l>These eyes, now rais'd in thanks to heaven and thee,</l>
<l>Had wept her lifeless.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALADORE.</speaker>
<l>Ever prais'd be Fortune,</l>
<l>That plac'd me near her! Since a common feat</l>
<l>That daily dies our weapons, thus ennobled</l>
<l>By blest conjunct on with her precious safety,</l>
<l>I would not change for the best garland won</l>
<l>By Caesar's conquering sword.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>We are not nice</l>
<l>In dangers imminent to chuse the means</l>
<l>Of our deliverance; yet, believe me, Sir,</l>
<l>More than for life preserv'd, I thank the chance</l>
<l>That made you my preserver. Th' unwelcome hand</l>
<l>Rendering us service, like sharp frost in sunshine,</l>
<l>Chills the fresh blossom of our gratitude,</l>
<l>Which else uncheck'd would put forth all its sweetness.</l>

<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>I have much serious matter for your ear;

<l>My cruel heart beats high to give it welcome;</l>
<l>For Virtue's test is action.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Thus my paper:</l>
<l>(Brief its contents, but fearful) Burgundy,</l>
<l>Stung by refusal of my daughter's love,</l>
<l>Stirs up commotion 'gainst our kingdom's peace;</l>
<l>And soon the golden grain of Lombardy</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>Heaven avert it!</l>
<l>For sure 'twere better I had ne'er been born,</l>
<l>Than live the fatal cause why war's rude blast</l>
<l>Disturb'd the quiet of my father's age,</l>
<l>Which soft repose shou'd foster. The griev'd people</l>
<l>Will chide your gentleness, that did not bend</l>
<l>My heart to this obedience; and your virtue,</l>
<l>Seen thro' th' unwelcome colour of the event,</l>
<l>For reverence find upbraiding.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>No, Sophia!</l>
<l>I would not violate the meanest right</l>
<l>Of my least subject, for the fear or promise</l>
<l>Of any issue. Is my child, my daughter,</l>
<l>(Sweet, duteous, amiable, burn free and royal)</l>
<l>Less charter'd from oppression than a stranger?</l>
<l>A self-invited wooer here he sojourn'd,</l>
<l>To thrive as your approving gave him licence:</l>
<l>I fed him not with promise, you with hope,</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="11"/>Nor shall audacious menace ere extort</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALADORE.</speaker>
<l>To his teeth</l>
<l>Hurl your defiance, King! 'tis proud to threaten,</l>
<l>But baseness to be aw'd by it. From my breast</l>
<l>I'd tear these hallow'd symbols, give this steel</l>
<l>To be a baby's play-thing, cou'd my heart,</l>
<l>Distrustful of the event, forbode one fear,</l>
<l>To cast black presage on a cause so noble.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Thou gem of Britain! Dear in my esteem</l>
<l>As wert thou native here, be Pavias' shield</l>

<l>Beauteous aenigma! Who wou'd solve you rightly,</l>
<l>Must thus interpret: make your outward semblance</l>
<l>An index pointing to its contrary.</l>
<l>When your smooth polish'd vizors beam in smiles,</l>
<l>Displeasure's at your hearts; the moody brow</l>
<l>Tells inward sun-shine; tears are joy, not sorrow;</l>
<l>You sooth where you approve not, and look gall,</l>
<l>When sweet content honies your appetites.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALADORE.</speaker>
<l>These common railings 'gainst that gentle sex,</l>
<l>Denote his humour more who utters them,</l>
<l>Than their defect, or any deep conception.</l>
<l>But you have chosen a season for hard thoughts</l>
<l>Rebukes your censure; still the chamber's air</l>
<l>Winnows her balmy breathing; from our eyes</l>
<l>Scarce glides her beauteous form, when your dark spleen</l>
<l>As venom'd things suck poison from sweet flowers,</l>
<l>Finds matter for distemper's nourishment,</l>
<l>And food for calumny in excellence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>Her form indeed is fair.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALADORE.</speaker>
<l>Ay, and her mind</l>
<l>(If more can be) more fair, more amiable.</l>
<l>Thy never-render'd snow-cold Apenine,</l>
<l>Is not so free from taint, as from offence</l>
<l>Her spotless bosom; yet has she a tear,</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="15"/>Healing as balm for others frailties,</l>
<l>That makes remission heavenly; sweet persuasion</l>
<l>Hangs on her words with power oracular,</l>
<l>To shame the cynic's chiding—Spirit of truth!</l>
<l>She is thy visible divinity,</l>
<l>And 'tis thy reverence to pay homage to her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>'Tis to my wish
<stage>[Aside.]</stage>
—I grant her well endow'd,</l>
<l>And in fair seeming most pre-eminent;</l>
<l>But for these other virtues you have nam'd,</l>
<l>They are of different climes, and earlier ages;</l>
<l>Our Pavias ladies, cast in earthly moulds,</l>
<l>They make the most of Nature's liberal gifts,</l>
<l>Put pleasure out to usury, and love</l>
<l>As ease, convenience, or the moment sways them.</l>

<speaker>PALADORE.</speaker>
<l>And heaven may be belov'd—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>Ay, and hop'd too;</l>
<l>For heaven has many mansions, and receives,</l>
<l>Too large for limitation, all deservers;</l>
<l>But in a lady's heart, there's but one place,</l>
<l>Though many may contend for't: therefore, friend,</l>
<l>Waste not your precious sighs, which might enkindle</l>
<l>Bright sparks of equal love in some soft breast</l>
<l>Destined to mate your fondness, in hopeless wooing.</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="16"/>Search not the cause; believe me, on my truth,</l>
<l>'Tis past all reckoning hopeless.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALADORE.</speaker>
<l>Nothing's hopeless,</l>
<l>Though deeds, untried, oft seem impossible;</l>
<l>And craven Sloth molting his sleekless plumes</l>
<l>With drowsy wonder views the advent'rous wing</l>
<l>That soars the shining azure o'er his head.</l>
<l>What will not yield to daring? Victory</l>
<l>Sits on the helm whose crest is Confidence;</l>
<l>And boldness wins success in love's soft strife,</l>
<l>As in the dangerous din of rattling war.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>How cou'd I make me sport were I light minded,</l>
<l>Were I malignant; mischief, from this mood,</l>
<l>That runs so contrary to all sober sense—</l>
<l>But here I rest in kindness—Be advis'd,</l>
<l>Push not a desperate purpose; by my life!</l>
<l>The princess loves you not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALADORE.</speaker>
<l>I'll bear no more—</l>

<l>From crown to toe, walk round thee, and survey thee</l>
<l>Like a prodigious thing; for such thou should'st be,</l>

<l>Lovers are sick with fevers of the brain,</l>

<l>Shoot from her eye to light eternal love</l>
<l>At passion's altar; were she swart, and froward,</l>

<l>I would assume an unfelt extasy,</l>
<l>Invoke her name, till echo should grow faint</l>
<l>With the perpetual burden, and devise</l>
<l>All means of contradiction, to proclaim</l>
<l>Scorn of thy council, and defiance to thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BIRENO.</speaker>
<l>Then hear, to dash thy pride, since thus you urge me.</l>
<l>My experience of her lightness, well she knows</l>
<l>Would freeze me as her husband, and her hand</l>
<l>(Which, but to save appearances, I ask)</l>
<l>I wou'd reject, if offer'd; so her craft</l>
<l>Sooths you with feign'd endearments. As a mistress,</l>
<l>I find her worth my holding; but a wife,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>I have lov'd thee</l>
<l>With fondness so unbated, that 'twere needless,</l>
<l>For confirmation, to attest by words,</l>
<l>What all my thoughts, my life's whole carriage towards thee,</l>
<l>Have set beyond the question.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>Oh, to me,</l>
<l>Your love has been like those perpetual springs,</l>
<l>"That ever flow," and waste not my least wish</l>
<l>Scarce had its birth, ere its accomplishment</l>
<l>In your preventive kindness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Since 'tis so,</l>
<l>If chance the current of my present will</l>
<l>To yours run contrary, you must not deem</l>
<l>That meerly to enforce authority,</l>
<l>Or wake controlement, which might sleep to death.</l>
<l>In its difuse, I now expect the course</l>
<l>Of your desires should lose themselves in mine,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>As my father,</l>
<l>The giver of my life, I reverence you;</l>
<l>Next, as your subject, my obedience stands</l>
<l>Bound by the general tie; but since your power</l>
<l>Has still been temper'd so with lenity,</l>
<l>That even the stranger's cause, with patient hearing,</l>
<l>Is weigh'd ere you determine; I, your daughter,</l>
<l><pb n="18" facs="21"/>May hope, at least, an equal privilege,</l>
<l>With favour in my audience.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>I were else</l>
<l>Unnatural, withholding from my child,</l>
<l>What aliens claim by justice. Give me hearing—</l>
<l>The Duke Bireno loves you, has my promise,</l>
<l>That like a well-grac'd advocate, my tongue</l>
<l>Shou'd win your gentle favour to his suit,</l>
<l>Urging such commendations of his love,</l>
<l>As modesty, though conscious of desert,</l>
<l>May wish you hear, yet cannot speak itself.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>Ah, Sir! forbear, he knows my heart already,</l>
<l>Already has he heard, from my own lips</l>
<l>I cannot love him; poorly he engages</l>
<l>Your honour'd combination, in a league</l>
<l>That (whatsoe'er its issue) must conspire</l>
<l>To wound your daughter's peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>By heaven, you wrong him.</l>
<l>To wound your peace! He seeks your happiness,</l>
<l>And so am I his second.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>But these means</l>
<l>Are adverse to the end; for if I wed him,</l>
<l>(This is no raving of rash extacy)</l>
<l>On death, that only can dissolve my chain,</l>
<l>Will hang my future hope: as eagerly</l>
<l>As the poor weary sea-beat mariner</l>
<l>Pants for the shore, so shall my outstretch'd arms</l>
<l>Embrace the welcome terror. My refusal</l>
<l>To you, the gentlest, kindest, best of fathers,</l>
<l>Must seem repugnance harsh, and o'er my duty,</l>
<l>Before untainted, casts the sickly hue</l>
<l>Of pale suspicion; thus begins his love,</l>
<l>Fearful to me in each alternative.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="19" facs="22"/>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Why, this is infant rhet'ric, to protest</l>

<l>Which never causeless sways the human breast,</l>
<l>Yet give no reason why.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>Alas! to feel it,</l>
<l>O'er-masters every reason. Need we search</l>

<l>And makes the heart our umpire?</l>

<l>Hear me calmly—</l>
<l>My days are almost number'd: this white head</l>
<l>Bears not in vain its reverend monitors;</l>
<l>Time puts a tongue in every hoary hair,</l>
<l>To warn the wise man of mortality:</l>
<l>When I am gone, behold thy single state</l>
<l>Unhusbanded, unfather'd, stands expos'd,</l>
<l>Ev'n as the tender solitary shrub,</l>
<l>On the bleak mountain's summit—Every blast</l>
<l>May bend or break thy sweetness: this strong fence,</l>
<l>This union, would enroot its shelter round,</l>
<l>And, like a forest, shield thee.</l>
</sp>

<l>Let me hope</l>
<l>A stronger sence in a whole people's love:</l>
<l>Their grateful memory of my father's virtue,</l>
<l>And loyalty hereditarly mine,</l>
<l>Descending, like the sceptre, to your issue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Think'st thou, my aspiring kinsman, whose ambition,</l>
<l>Impatient, waits till my declining beam</l>
<l>Give place to his meridian, who, already</l>
<l>Wins from my side a moiety of my court,</l>
<l>By his succession's hope, will tamely view</l>
<l>That sceptre wielded by a woman's hand,</l>
<l><pb n="20" facs="23"/>Nor wrest it from thy grasp? No, my fair kingdom!</l>
<l>I see the meeting torrents of contention</l>
<l>Deluge thy peaceful vales, while her weak sex,</l>
<l>Unable to direct, or stem the tide,</l>
<l>Will be borne down, and swept to ruin with it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PRINCESS.</speaker>
<l>These evils, but in possibility,</l>
<l>May never come: but, Oh, 'tis certain sorrow</l>
<l>To promise love, obedience, duty, honor,</l>
<l>When the heart's record vouches 'gainst the tongue:</l>
<l>It changes order's course; the holy tie</l>
<l>Of weil-proportion'd marriage still supposes</l>
<l>These bonds have gone before; nor is there power</l>
<l>Creative in the simple ceremony,</l>
<l>The seed unsown, to give that harvest growth.</l>

<l>Your pardon, Sir; I fear I've made you wait—</l>

<l>'Twere kind, perhaps, to leave you in that error.</l>

</sp>

<l>With all convenient speed. You're not to learn,</l>

<l>Hold yet a little. Now, Sir, once again</l>
<l>Let this be touch'd.—Your enmity to me,</l>

<l>Faith, prudence, honor, govern'd appetites,</l>
<l>(Whose everlasting bonds make passion wise)</l>
<l>In her were only seeming, or like ornament</l>
<l>Thrown by, or worn at pleasure; then this sorrow</l>
<l>Hangs on her outside only, that's unchang'd,</l>
<l>For falshood did not dim her radiant eyes,</l>
<l>Her cheek was damask'd with as pure a rose,</l>
<l>Her breath as odorous, when she most deceiv'd,</l>
<l>As when her virture, like her specious form,</l>
<l>Seem'd spotless, and unparagon'd.</l>
</sp>

<l>My Lord!</l>
<l>Court not this solitude, speak out your grief;</l>
<l>Mine is no flinty breast; this dangerous spleen,</l>

<head>PROLOGUE to the LAW of LOMBARDY,</head>
<byline>Written by the AUTHOR.</byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. FARREN.</byline>
<sp>
<l>HARD is the task, in modern days to choose,</l>
<l>Congenial subjects for the tragic muse:</l>
<l>The historian's page, the fertile epic store,</l>
<l>Were known, and ransack'd centuries before:</l>
<l>Like luscious gardens, unenclos'd they lay,</l>
<l>To ev'ry saunt'ring bard an easy prey.</l>
<l>They enter'd, and, as taste impell'd, they fed</l>
<l>On Homer some, and some on Hollingshead.</l>
<l>From loftiest numbers, or from humblest prose,</l>
<l>As each conspir'd, the artless structures rose.</l>
<l>Thus one great labour of their work was o'er,</l>
<l>They found a fable, and they fought no more.</l>
<l>Careless were they of action, place, or time,</l>
<l>Whose only toil was dialogue and rhyme.</l>
<l>"Rules which the rigid Stagyrite devis'd,</l>
<l>"Our fathers knew not, or, if known, despis'd.</l>
<l>Whilst side by side, were mingled in the scene,</l>
<l>A laughing rustic, and a weeping queen.</l>
<l>Space was obedient to the boundless piece,</l>
<l>That op'd in Mexico, and clos'd in Greece.</l>
<l>Then thick with plots the crowded tale was sown,</l>
<l>'Till the divided bosom felt for none;</l>
<l>"They fear'd no censures of a frowning pit,</l>
<l>"That judg'd as loosely as the authors writ."</l>
<l>But we, who posted in time's tardy rear,</l>
<l>Before a learn'd tribunal now appear;</l>
<l>With anxious art a fable must design,</l>
<l>Where probability, and interest join:</l>
<l>Where time, and place, and action, all agree</l>
<l>To violate no sacred unity.</l>
<l>And thus each candid critic must confess</l>
<l>The labour greater, and indulgence less;</l>
<l>When such the task, the wonder is to meet,</l>
<l>Not many pieces bad, but one complete.</l>
<l>Nor let presumptious poets fondly claim</l>
<l>From rules exemption, by great Shakespeare's name;</l>
<l>Though comets move with wild excentric force,</l>
<l>Yet humbler planets keep their stated course.</l>
<l>But now, a bard, who touch'd your hearts before,</l>
<l>Again salutes you from a neighbouring shore.</l>
<l>Fir'd by the applause you gave his early lays,</l>
<l>He stands again a candidate for praise;</l>
<l>Nor from your former favour dares foresee</l>
<l>To worthless strains a partial destiny.</l>
<l>But if his virgin palm was fairly won,</l>
<l>And this next course with equal vigour's run,</l>
<l>Now join to bind his fresher laurels on.</l>
<l>He fears no jaundic'd rival's envious breath,</l>
<l>The hands which twin'd, shall still preserve the wreath.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE to the LAW of LOMBARDY.</head>
<byline>Written by the AUTHOR.</byline>
<byline>Spoken by Miss YOUNGE.</byline>
<sp>
<l>OF all the Gothic laws I ever heard,</l>
<l>This Lombard Law was sure the most absurd:</l>
<l>What! could the monsters mean to make us die,</l>
<l>But for a little harmless gallantry?</l>
<l>Were such a barbarous custom now in fashion,</l>
<l>Good Lord! it would unpeople half the nation.</l>
<l>Scaffolds on scaffolds now the streets would fill,</l>
<l>As sign-posts did, before the paving-bill.</l>
<l>Were British law-makers such rigorous churls,</l>
<l>They'd hardly leave a head to wear false curls.</l>
<l>Besides, what champion now would risque his life,</l>
<l>To gain what most men shudder at—a wife.</l>
<l>Instead of arm'd knights, at trumpet's summons,</l>
<l>Commend me to our proctors, and the Commons.</l>
<l>There, though we lose our husbands, and our fame,</l>
<l>We get our portion, and a maiden name.</l>
<l>And if her fortune, and her charms remain,</l>
<l>Then Miss may wed—and be divorc'd again.</l>
<l>Yet, though these frolics have of late been common,</l>
<l>Lay not the blame entirely on weak woman.</l>
<l>The careless mate his rival recommends,</l>
<l>We find him 'midst his own obliging friends.</l>
<l>Some swain, who swears he lives but in our eyes,</l>
<l>And plies us with such cunning flatteries,</l>
<l>That spouse neglecting us, and lover wooing,</l>
<l>One strives, and t'other leads us, to our ruin.</l>
<l>So, if weak ladies, chance to go astray,</l>
<l>Their lords, methinks, are more in fault than they:</l>
<l>The goal of marriage reach'd, the men lie down,</l>
<l>Like weary racers when the prize is won;</l>
<l>Mere catching us alone their care engages;</l>
<l>The nets they spread, but never mind the cages.</l>
<l>The married gamester more delight can find,</l>
<l>In "Seven's the main," than all dear womankind.</l>
<l>Acteon wedded, to our voice prefers</l>
<l>The sweeter music of his yelping ours;</l>
<l>While the dull sot, who his six bottles boasts,</l>
<l>Thinks women good for nothing—but for toasts.</l>
<l>Thus slighted for the glass, the hound, the die,</l>
<l>Our pride steps in, and to revenge we fly;</l>
<l>One obvious method only can preserve us,</l>
<l>Strive, by your own attentions, to deserve us;</l>
<l>And now, as formerly, be sure you'll prove,</l>
<l>Contempt will meet contempt, as love meets love.</l>
