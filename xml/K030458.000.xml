<head><hi>TO</hi> MRS. SIDDONS.</head>
<opener><salute>DEAR MADAM,</salute></opener>
<p>THE high admiration I ever felt for the superior talents you have so eminently displayed in ALMEYDA, could alone have induced me to venture a second dramatick production. To that admiration, a more intimate knowledge of you, has added an esteem; which is, I flatter myself, reciprocal. Not all the various charms you dignify the Drama with, can equal those of your sympathizing mind, and unassuming manners.—When thus united, they form a character it would be vanity to praise, tho' virtue to delight in. With true gratitude,</p>
<closer>I remain, <salute>DEAR MADAM,</salute>
<signed>Your faithfully devoted Humble servant, SOPHIA LEE.</signed>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>IT was with no less awe than deference I ventured, in the present day, to bring a Tragedy before the Publick. How great, then, must be my gratitude for the liberal acceptation it has met, and the tears with which it has been honoured. I must have wanted taste and feeling, not to have been animated, by the exquisite talents of Mrs. SIDDONS, into an exertion of such as I possess. That I have been the means of displaying, in a new point of view, her various powers, is a most flattering recompence.</p>
<p>The story of ALMEYDA is wholly a fiction; and the incident which produces the catastrophe the only one not my own.—The deep impression made on me, long since, by a similar <hi>denouement,</hi> in an old play of JAMES SHIRLEY's, determined me to apply it.</p>
<p>The Stage requires a compression and brevity, which seldom improves a play to the reader: I have, therefore, printed ALMEYDA at length, marking by inverted commas the parts omitted in representation.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>THE Muses long through many a varying age,</l>
<l>With truth and fiction mix'd, have grac'd the stage.</l>
<l>When weeping Constancy devoted stood,</l>
<l>Or patriot Honour seal'd his faith with blood,</l>
<l>They bade the deep-toned lyre responsive flow,</l>
<l>Sublimed the suffering, and diffused the woe;</l>
<l>Applauding Greece the numbers lov'd to hear,</l>
<l>And her stern warriors gave the graceful tear.</l>
<l>At length her venal train Corruption led,</l>
<l>And, with the Virtues link'd, the muses fled</l>
<l>O'er Albion's happy land they paus'd awhile,</l>
<l>And shed the favouring influence of their smile.</l>
<l>Her HENRYS, HOTSPURS, trod the martial scene,</l>
<l>And sir'd to heroes whom they found but men.</l>
<l>Bold SHAKESPEAR pour'd th' invigorating strain,</l>
<l>And ROWE, and sweeter OTWAY, fill'd the train.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>What if the modern bard no more aspire,</l>
<l>To rival OTWAY's sweetness, SHAKESPEAR's fire;</l>
<l>What if no laurel meed his altar claim,</l>
<l>His censer boast no heav'n-enkindled flame,</l>
<l>Yet if beneath the smould'ring vapour shine</l>
<l>But one faint glimmering of the spark divine,</l>
<l>Ah! gently fan the flame! lest fashion's breath</l>
<l>O'er the pale promise send the blast of death;</l>
<l>Nor let the wreath Thalia only wear,</l>
<l>Her sister muse deserves so well to share.</l>
<l>'Tis her's the generous feeling to impart,</l>
<l>That mends the morals while it fills the heart:</l>
<l>Her's are the energies that best inform,</l>
<l>The sighs that animate, and tears that warm.</l>
<l>Within the magic sunshine of her eye,</l>
<l>Truth, Honour, Loyalty, and Valour lie;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="6"/>
<l>All the bord virtues that our sires approved,</l>
<l>And all that Britons boast, or Britons loved—</l>
<l>Then 'gainst the charm no more your bosom steel,</l>
<l>But own the manly privilege to feel.</l>
<l>Folly, and Vice, may oft in smiles appear,</l>
<l>But bashful Virtue veils her in a tear.</l>
<l>The bread, loud laugh, the mirth-inspiring jest,</l>
<l>Humour's wild frolic, and gay fancy's feast,</l>
<l>Like brilliant bubbles sparkle o'er the mind,</l>
<l>But burst, and leave no radiant gleam behind;</l>
<l>While the bright pencil of the tragic muse,</l>
<l>Her sacred rainbow draws o'er chilling dews;</l>
<l>And tho' to air the transient glories run,</l>
<l>They give the promise of a golden sun!</l>

<l>REMOVE those lights—the day once more returns,</l>

<l>—All animated beings gladly rise</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>May each to come</l>
<l>Breathe only peace upon thee; and restore</l>
<l>Those roses with ring on the shrine of friendship!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Alas! my father, bless too my Almeyda!</l>
<l>That <hi>solitary</hi> sov'reign! born to weep</l>
<l>The greatness thousands covet! thro' the night,</l>
<l>Sleepless, and tearful, she has still entreated</l>
<l>That I would win you ever to retain her.</l>
<l>A Moor <hi>in name</hi> alone, Granada's throne</l>
<l>Charms not her heart—possess'd, and alienate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>I cannot chuse but blame ev'n thee, my child,</l>
<l>If thou hast sought to win her from her duty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Nay, rather blame the parents who resign'd her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>Forbear these rash conclusions—Monarchs oft</l>
<l>Must sacrifice each feeling to their duty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Alas! that aught should break the tie of nature!</l>
<l>The ductile heart, as reason dawns, still takes</l>
<l>A soft impression of the nearest object—</l>
<l>Thus did Almeyda's—yet an infant hostage,</l>
<l>She wak'd to knowledge on a foe's kind bosom.</l>
<l>Her lips first falter'd our Castilian tongue,</l>
<l>And, with becoming gratitude she found</l>
<l>In those who fondly train'd her up to honor,</l>
<l>Each dear, each sacred tie, of love, and nature:</l>
<l>Nor did she mourn her sires, or brother's death,</l>
<l>As she does now to leave us.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>Nor have I,</l>
<l>My daughter, ill-deserv'd this gen'rous fondness,</l>
<l>Since with my children she has shar'd my heart,</l>
<l>—No, tho' to death I hate the Moorish race,</l>
<l>Vindictive, and insatiate—tho' my sword</l>
<l>Ev'n yet could flame amid my country's foes</l>
<l>With energy unbroken, never knew I</l>
<l>To view a tender babe with abhorrence.</l>
<l>—Ah! sweet Almeyda! in this very hall</l>
<l>Thy cries, unconscious of thy fate, assail'd</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="9"/>A heart alive to nature and humanity!</l>
<l>When with the error of soft innocence</l>
<l>Thy little arms clung round thy father's foe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Was this the castle, where Almanzor chose</l>
<l>To lodge his queen for safety?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>Ay—and wife</l>
<l>Had prov'd his choice, if Heav'n their arms had prosper'd.</l>
<l>—Thou seest—'tis solid as the rock that bears it;</l>
<l>Its proud tow'rs shadow our Castilian plains,</l>
<l>Tho' sever'd from them by the Guadalquiver.</l>
<l>—They since have aw'd their owner.—For that day</l>
<l>Heaven blest the holy valour it inspir'd!</l>
<l>That memorable day gave to our arms,</l>
<l>An host almost unnumber'd, but by slain.</l>
<l>—Flush'd with our conquest, we assail'd this castle,</l>
<l>Which the intimidated queen threw open,</l>
<l>And as an hostage gave us up her daughter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Oh! mother ill-deserving my Almeyda!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>Erroneous youth still takes the first impression,</l>
<l>Nor looks beyond the surface! Be more wise;</l>
<l>Learn to pierce through the veil of policy,</l>
<l>Undazzled by its colours.—So thy friend</l>
<l>Shall better meet the future.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>I attend,</l>
<l>With reverence so profound, each other sense</l>
<l>Is lost in hearing—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>Know the queen thy censure</l>
<l>Condemns unheard, should rather claim thy pity.</l>
<l>Match'd to a monarch weak, vain, cold of heart,</l>
<l>Yet <hi>restless</hi> tho' <hi>inactive</hi>—her short life</l>
<l>Pass'd in disquiet; from the hour that call'd her.</l>
<l>Almanzor's crafty brother gain'd the pow'r,</l>
<l>And in the king's name shelter'd every baseness.</l>
<l>Two rising princes scorn'd their uncle's sway,</l>
<l>Alas! perhaps too boldly!—heav'n alone</l>
<l>Can judge the malady that nipp'd their bloom.</l>
<l>—Certain it is, Abdallah never offer'd</l>
<l>A due equiv'lent for our royal hostage</l>
<l>Until she heir'd Granada.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Sweet Almeyda!</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="10"/>Is this the savage trusted with thy welfare?</l>
<l>—<hi>Thou</hi> too, perhaps, art doom'd by his ambition.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>Not so my daughter.—Politicians ever</l>
<l>Present a puppet to the public eye,</l>
<l>While they, unseen, delight to guide its motions.</l>
<l>—Almeyda thus is needful to her uncle,</l>
<l>Who hopes to find in her a weak, vain woman.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Heav'n, for his punishment, then form'd an angel!</l>
<l>—Who, like Almeyda ever knew to blend</l>
<l>Th' eccentric, noble wildness of the Moor,</l>
<l>With ev'ry polish'd grace of our Castile?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>She is too frank, incautious, and ungovern'd.</l>
<l>More rude than cataracts her passions rage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Yet <hi>still</hi> like those, profusely pour upon us</l>
<l>Rich <hi>ore,</hi> for ever else beyond our reach!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>She must <hi>conceal</hi> those passions to be <hi>great,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Subdue</hi> them to be <hi>happy.</hi> In the mind</l>
<l>All sov'reignty begins, and ends.—Who rules</l>
<l>Impartially the frailties of his nature</l>
<l>Rises almost beyond it, and extends,</l>
<l>Far as his name is known, a willing empire.</l>
<l>Teach thy fair friend, my child, this useful lesson,</l>
<l>And next thy brother—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Ah! alike he needs it!</l>
<l>—I dread the wild concussion of his passions,</l>
<l>When he shall learn you choose the very hour,</l>
<l>In which he bravely fights his country's battles,</l>
<l>To yield the fair, who gives his life a value.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>I <hi>therefore</hi> choose it. Well I know, his temper</l>
<l>Is, like Almeyda's own, warm and ungovern'd.</l>
<l>Misjudging boy! to fix thy idle heart</l>
<l>On her, forever placed beyond thy reach!</l>
<l>Why saw I not, in childhood, this fond love,</l>
<l>Which, like a blight, clings to my life's best blossom?</l>
<l>—Yet could <hi>my</hi> son ere hope to wed Almeyda?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Alas, my father, when their love commenc'd,</l>
<l>Almeyda had two brothers; and my mother</l>
<l>Still fondly fancied, by this union, peace</l>
<l>Might one day bless the long contesting nations.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramirez.</speaker>
<l>Romantic dream of youth, and idle passion!</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="11"/>What pow'r can reconcile the cross and crescent?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Frown not, my father, if I further add,</l>
<l>Endear'd to christian laws, and christian manners,</l>
<l>Almeyda were to both an easy convert.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAMIREZ</speaker>
<stage>(sternly.)</stage>
<l>Victoria, if thou would'st atone thy fault</l>
<l>In cherishing this weakness, join to soothe</l>
<l>Thy brother's disappointment—Tell Alonzo,</l>
<l>My love for him—my justice—nay, my prudence</l>
<l>Constrain me to resign his heart's sole object.</l>
<l>—Knows he not hardly we maintain our ground</l>
<l>Against these treach'rous neighbours, and must still,</l>
<l>Whate'er the sacrifice, defend our country?</l>
<l>—No news from Murcia yet?—Oh! how I long</l>
<l>To hear the issue of the impending battle!</l>
<l>—The rising sun gleams on the Moorish helms,</l>
<l>And gives a trembling lustre to yon fields!</l>
<l>—Th' appointed moment comes to sign the treaty.</l>
<l>I see Almeyda too, but dare not meet her;</l>
<l>Far be it from me to offend her feelings,</l>
<l>Or sacrifice my own—bid her adieu!</l>
<stage>Exit Ramirez.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALMEYDA</speaker>
<stage>(entering on the other side.)</stage>
<l>During this trying interval, Victoria,</l>
<l>I had prepar'd myself to meet the King,</l>
<l>And now with breathless fear impatient sought him.</l>
<l>Ah, wherefore flies he then? Still he relents not?</l>
<l>—Thou, or I greatly err, hast sued in vain—</l>
<l>Hast sued <hi>a Sov'reign</hi> might remain in bonds,</l>
<l>And yield dominion for implicit duty</l>
<l>—Well then I bow disdainful to my fate—</l>
<l>Yet have a care, Ramirez, thy proud heart</l>
<l>May one day feel the pang that pierces mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>What means my dear Almeyda?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Almeyda.</speaker>
<l>Ah! Alonzo!</l>
<l><hi>Thou</hi> wilt not thus resign—<hi>thou</hi> wilt not scorn me,</l>
<l>—Amid the rage of arms—the din of battle</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="12"/>Almeyda's sighs shall still be heard, still felt,</l>
<l>And counteract all policy—alas!</l>
<l>I there alike may err, and ev'n Alonzo</l>
<l>May bid the eagle glory chace the dove,</l>
<l>And see the victim flutter to the ground.</l>
<l>—Alonzo leads the war, and quite forgets me!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Gentle Almeyda—govern these wild transports,</l>
<l>Which ever warp your judgment—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Almeyda.</speaker>
<l>Do not hope it—</l>
<l>Nor venture to decide a lover's conduct—</l>
<l>Thy tranquil blood flows equal thro' thy veins,</l>
<l>Like the clear riv'let thro' the grassy vale,</l>
<l>While mine, impetuous as the bounding billows,</l>
<l>Swells to my heart, thence rapidly returns</l>
<l>And in the tumult swallows up wreck'd reason!</l>
<l>—Hadst thou, like me, been bosom'd among strangers,</l>
<l>And giv'n thy soul in recompence for love,</l>
<l>When found thyself torn from this happy home,</l>
<l>To waste a gaudy life in cold indifference,</l>
<l>Like mine thy aching sense would swell to anguish,</l>
<l>Like mine in tears would drown thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>Yet believe</l>
<l>Alonzo's love unblemished as his honor,</l>
<l>And rather <hi>praise</hi> than <hi>blame</hi> his sense of duty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Almeyda.</speaker>
<l>Why wilt thou shame my cheek?—Alas! Victoria,</l>
<l>Had I rememb'red <hi>mine,</hi> ne'er had I shed</l>
<l>These burning drops—ev'n at this awful hour</l>
<l>When from the grave my ancestors demand me,</l>
<l>To all the pride, and pow'r of purple empire,</l>
<l>My heart flies back to hover near my love,</l>
<l>And envies ev'ry slave, who daily sees him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>This is alike erroneous—darling friend,</l>
<l>With steadier eye survey the past and future—</l>
<l>So shall your mind extract repose from reason.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Almeyda.</speaker>
<l>Away with <hi>reason!</hi> melancholy hermit!</l>
<l>Who idle eyes the storm, then, vainly active,</l>
<l>Collects, and treasures, ev'ry wreck of passion!</l>
<l>—I shall have hopeless years enough for reason,</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="13"/>And give this hour to love.—Oh! say Victoria,</l>
<l>—And yet I dread to hear—is the King fixed</l>
<l>To ratify the peace?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Victoria.</speaker>
<l>He has no choice—</l>
<l>The rights of nations and his country's welfare,</l>
<l>Oblige him to restore you.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Almeyda.</speaker>
<l>Rather say,</l>
<l>He has no heart—nor feels for my affliction—</l>
<l>—Ah! if the rights of nations were his rule,</l>
<l>Why did he subjugate a Monarch's daughter?</l>
<l>Why win her easy heart by gracious treatment?</l>
<l>Until secure of silent, anxious, duty,</l>
<l>He gave the Moors a Queen—himself a slave.—</l>

<l>WHEN wilt thou learn, my son, to guard thy heart,</l>

<l>Pray you, pardon,</l>
<l>If ardent nature stifles feebler reason.</l>
<l>—Could I behold Almeyda, and restrain</l>
<l>This glow of transport, ne'er could I deserve</l>
<l>The bliss our prophet promises the faithful.</l>
<l>—No, not himself▪ though Heav'n inspir'd, ere fancied</l>
<l>So exquisite a beauty! Yet that charm,</l>
<l>Nature's prime gift to woman, in Almeyda.</l>
<l>Is lost—absorpt in mind!—</l>

<l>Check not thy transport;</l>
<l>For tho' to others I would have thee silent,</l>
<l>To me be wholly frank; and thus reward me</l>

<l>Would strike thee with displeasure.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orasmyn.</speaker>
<l>Call not thus</l>
<l>The sacred consciousness that waits on beauty,</l>
<l>And awes the wishes it awakes! I ever</l>

<l>But who can boast</l>
<l>A choice like mine? Nor did ev'n I suspect,</l>

<l>I came prepared by rigid rules to judge her—</l>
<l><hi>Her</hi> before whom all rules, all modes, must vanish!</l>

<l>Ethereal loveliness informs her frame,</l>

<l>Yet o'er these charms sublime, meek modesty</l>
<l>Draws a transparent veil of wand'ring graces,</l>

<l>Beauty's an indeterminate idea</l>
<l>Till fix'd by love—whose ever-pow'rful magic</l>
<l>Awakens a new being—love, when heav'n</l>
<l>Leaves to the vulgar sense its work imperfect,</l>
<l>Illumes our sight to trace the angel there.</l>
<l>—Thro' love we share our Maker's great prerogative,</l>
<l><hi>Creating</hi> ev'ry charm, and then approving!</l>
<l>—Yet when she spoke, I half forgot her beauty—</l>
<l>Oh! with what melting harmony she won,</l>
<l>The very air to silence; no rude breath</l>

<l>To match thee with Almeyda, and exalt thee</l>

<l>The object of my life—nor should I think</l>
<l>That life itself too dear to crown my purpose.</l>

<l>I heeded not, 'tis true, the glowing colours</l>
<l>Fond fancy gives her fav'rites—yet those tints</l>

<l>Sweet Almeyda!</l>

<l>Already hath the council's wise proposal,</l>
<l>—Already hath thy gracious silence reach'd me.—</l>

<speaker>Almeyda.</speaker>
<l>Silence, my lord, implies not a decision.—</l>

<l>The world, and all its ways, to me unknown,</l>
<l>I must have time to learn the needful science.</l>

<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>Thou shalt escape the deep, laborious study;</l>

<l>Seek not at once to snatch me from myself.</l>
<l>—Were I to wed, while hardly yet enfranchis'd,</l>
<l>'Twould mark a latent weakness in my nature,</l>
<l>Or a determin'd selfishness in thine.</l>

<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>Ay; were thy spouse ignoble—unbelov'd.</l>
<l>But with <hi>my son,</hi> dishonour ne'er was nam'd!</l>
<l>He was thy father's choice—his eye's last object.</l>
<l>When life receded fast, he call'd Orasmyn;</l>
<l>Then, with parental fondness, wrung his hand,</l>
<l>And charg'd him to entender his Almeyda.—</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>HAST thou thus watch'd the night away, my son,</l>
<l>Regardless of the common dues of nature?</l>
<l>—The day will come, when thou'lt regret in vain,</l>
<l>This lavish waste alike of health and feeling!</l>
<l>And why thus strictly-guard a maniac?</l>
<l>—Who will assail Almeyda?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="54" facs="54"/>
<speaker>Orasmyn.</speaker>
<l>Who will soothe her?</l>
<l>—It is among the fatal rights of rank</l>
<l>To want all common blessings! Never more,</l>
<l>Alas! shall this sweet visionary find them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>Has, then, her frenzy known no interval,</l>
<l>And the long night elapsed in restless ravings?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orasmyn.</speaker>
<l>Th' inventive evil took such various forms</l>
<l>As fancy scarce could follow—pausing often</l>
<l>In vacant silence, or in speechless anguish!</l>
<l>—Anon, more musical than the lone bird,</l>
<l>Who pours her sorrows to the midnight moon,</l>
<l>She waked the drowsy night! Oft the wild strain</l>
<l>Soar'd ev'n to Heav'n—As oft it died away,—</l>
<l>Like the uncertain sweetness of that harp,</l>
<l>The light breeze softly touches!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>Thoughts like these,</l>
<l>Will undermine the firmness of thy nature.—</l>
<l>Orasmyn! as thou lov'st me, shake them off!</l>
<l>Thou art the better part of my existence;</l>
<l>And when thou droop'st I sink.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orasmyn.</speaker>
<l>At once to see,</l>
<l>The flow'r of nature in the morning wither!</l>
<l>Ev'n while my senses ached at its perfection!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>How wise—how gen'rous were those lavish tears,</l>
<l>Could sympathy restore the hapless suff'rer!</l>
<l>But other duties call thee into action.—</l>
<l>Time will not with thee watch Almeyda's frenzy,</l>
<l>Nor the great wheel of empire cease its motion—</l>
<l>Thy hand must guide it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orasmyn.</speaker>
<l>Empire! said my father?</l>
<l>—Shall I usurp Almeyda's royal seat?</l>
<l>Grow great by her misfortune! Rather bid me</l>
<l>Dig at her feet the grave she wildly calls for,</l>
<l>And fill it undishonor'd! Oh! no more.</l>
<l>I would not understand you!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>Say thou <hi>wilt</hi> not,</l>
<l>And I am answer'd.—Weak, romantick boy!</l>
<l>Loiter thy life away upon her threshold!</l>
<l>Renounce thy sire, thy rank, thy name in arms,</l>

<l>To that quick sense, which, striking at the heart,</l>
<l>Damns, ev'n on earth, the guilty! Oh, beware!</l>
<l>And dread, in time, to know the dire pulsation!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>Dar'st thou suppose it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orasmyn.</speaker>
<l>The mere thought was treason!</l>
<l>—Yet, a calamity so sudden, speaks</l>
<l>Some known, yet latent cause.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>I heed thee well—</l>
<l>And feel, ungrateful son! through ev'ry fibre,</l>
<l>The yet unspoken censure! But yet, remember,</l>
<l>Had I more <hi>crimes</hi> than <hi>thoughts,</hi> 'tis thou <hi>hast caus'd</hi> them!</l>

<l>Him, who, thus agoniz'd with doubt and fear,</l>
<l>Finds no pow'r perfect but unshaken honour!</l>
<l>And that pure pride he'll cherish, unto death.</l>
<l>—No vain—no selfish—no ambitious thought,</l>

<l>That hapless sov'reign I have sworn to guard!</l>
<l>The vow yet lives, unchill'd, upon <hi>your</hi> lips!</l>

<l>'Tis well. This black ingratitude has steel'd me!</l>

<l>Have I, then, liv'd for thee in vain, Orasmyn?</l>
<l>—A <hi>girl,</hi> by one soft glance, annihilates</l>
<l>Those rights a life of fondness should have gain'd me!</l>
<l>—Hast thou forgot thy father's heir Granada,</l>
<l><pb n="56" facs="56"/>Regardless of thy scruples, or thy choice?</l>
<l>—Ev'n now the golden circlet binds my brow,</l>
<l>And in Abdallah henceforth know thy king!</l>
<l>—I have dispos'd the Council to believe,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>Lost in frenzy—</l>
<l>With vacant eye, ev'n now, she gaz'd upon me,</l>
<l>But knew nor voice, nor feature!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nourassin.</speaker>
<l>'Tis too plain—</l>
<l>The malady's habitual! Those starts</l>
<l>Ev'n as we hail'd her glad return, bespoke</l>
<l>A strange distraction, or some buried passion.</l>
<l>—Castile, with matchless policy, has kept</l>
<l>The mournful secret, 'till, the advantage gain'd,</l>
<l>With pomp he gave us back the gorgeous casket,</l>
<l>Nor own'd the gem was vanish'd.—</l>

<speaker>Abdallah.</speaker>
<l>Why then should we delay the abdication?</l>
<l>A <hi>form</hi> alone is wanting; and her hand,</l>

<l>To delegate that pow'r our laws deny her.</l>
<l>—Perchance, in the next transport of her frenzy,</l>
<l>No human pow'r may move her.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nourassin.</speaker>
<l>It were wise,</l>

<l>Already do I feel the subtle essence—</l>
<l>It rages onward, like the fires of Etna,</l>

<l>Thou soft perfection! I no more dare meet them.</l>
<l>—No, never dare I hope thou shouldst forgive</l>
