<p>THE PLATONICK LADY. A Comedy. As it is Acted at the QUEENS THEATRE IN THE <hi>HAY-MARKET.</hi></p>
<p>By the Author of the <hi>Gamester,</hi> and <hi>Love's Contrivance.</hi></p>

<pb facs="2"/>
<head>To all the Generous Encouragers of <hi>Female Ingenuity,</hi> this <hi>Play</hi> is Humbly Dedicated.</head>
<opener><salute>Gentlemen and Ladies;</salute></opener>
<p>MY Muse chose to make this Universal Address, hoping, among the numerous Crowd, to find some Souls Great enough to protect her against the Carping Malice of the Vulgar World; who think it a proof of their Sense, to dislike every thing that is writ by Women. I was the more induc'd to this General Application, from the Usage I have met on all sides.</p>
<p>A Play secretly introduc'd to the House, whilst the Author remains unknown, is approv'd by every Body: The Actors cry it up, and are in expectation of a great Run; the Bookseller of a Second Edition, and the Scribler of a Sixth Night: But if by chance the Plot's discover'd, and the Brat found Fatherless, immediately it flags in the Opinion of those that extoll'd it before, and the Bookseller falls in his Price, with this Reason only, <hi>It is a Woman's.</hi> Thus they alter their Judgment, by the Esteem they have for the Author, tho' the Play is still the same. They ne'er reflect, that we have had some Male-Productions of this kind, void of Plot and Wit, and full as insipid as ever a Woman's of us all.</p>
<p>I can't forbear inserting a Story which my Bookseller, that printed my <hi>Gamester,</hi> told me, of a Spark that had seen my <hi>Gamester</hi> three or four times, and lik'd it extremely: Having bought one of the Books, ask'd who the Author was; and being told, a Woman, threw down the Book, and put up his Money, saying, he had spent too much after it already, and was sure if the Town had known that, it wou'd never have run ten days. No doubt this was a Wit in his own Eyes. It is such as these that rob us of that which inspires the Poet, Praise. And it is such as these made him that Printed my Comedy call'd, <hi>Love's Contrivance;</hi> or, <hi>Medin</hi>
<pb facs="3"/>
<hi>cin Malgre lui,</hi> put two Letters of a wrong Name to it; which tho' it was the height of Injustice to me, yet his imposing on the Town turn'd to account with him; and thus passing for a Man's, it has been play'd at least a hundred times.</p>
<p>And why this Wrath against the Womens Works? Perhaps you'll answer, because they meddle with things out of their Sphere: But I say, no; for since the Poet is born, why not a Woman as well as a Man? Not that I wou'd derogate from those great Men who have a Genius, and Learning to improve that Genius: I only object against those ill-natur'd Criticks, who wanting both, think they have a sufficient claim to Sense, by railing at what they don't understand. Some have arm'd themselves with resolution not to like the Play they paid to see; and if in spite of Spleen they have been pleas'd against their Will, have maliciously reported it was none of mine, but given me by some Gentleman: Nay, even my own Sex, which shou'd assert our Prerogative against such Detractors, are often backward to encourage a Female Pen.</p>
<p>Wou'd these profest Enemies but consider what Examples we have had of Women that excell'd in all Arts; in Musick, Painting, Poetry; also in War: Nay, to our immortal Praise, what Empresses and Queens have fill'd the World? What cannot <hi>England</hi> boast from Women? The mighty <hi>Romans</hi> felt the Power of <hi>Boadicea</hi>'s Arm; <hi>Eliza</hi> made <hi>Spain</hi> tremble; but <hi>ANN,</hi> the greatest of the Three, has shook the Man that aim'd at Universal Sway. After naming this Miracle, the Glory of our Sex, sure none will spitefully cavil at the following Scenes, purely because a Woman writ'em. This I dare venture to say in their behalf, there is a Plot and Story in them, I hope will entertain the Reader; which is the utmost Ambition of,</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>By Captain <hi>Farqubar.</hi></byline>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. <hi>Betterton.</hi></stage>
<l>REjoice, ye Fair, the <hi>British</hi> Warrior's come,</l>
<l>Victorious o're, to your soft Wars at home.</l>
<l>Each Conqueror flies, with eager Longing's fraught,</l>
<l>To clasp the Darling Fair, for which he fought.</l>
<l>He lays his Trophies down before those Eyes,</l>
<l>By which Inspir'd, he won the Glorious Prize.</l>
<l>Prouder, when wellcom'd by his Generous Fair,</l>
<l>Of dying in her Arms, than Conquering there.</l>
<l>O! cou'd our Bards of <hi>Britains</hi> Isle but write</l>
<l>With the same Fire with which our Hero's fight:</l>
<l>Or cou'd our Stage but represent a Scene,</l>
<l>To Copy that on great <hi>Ramillis</hi> Plain;</l>
<l>Then we with Courage wou'd assert our Plays,</l>
<l>And to your glorious Laurels joyn our Bays.</l>
<l>But our poor <hi>Pegasus,</hi> a Beast of ease,</l>
<l>Cares not for foraging beyond the Seas:</l>
<l>Content with <hi>London</hi> Provender, he flyes,</l>
<l>To make each Coxcomb he can find, a Prize:</l>
<l>And after trudging long, perhaps he may</l>
<l>Pick up a Set of Fools, to furnish out a Play.</l>
<l>To make him Eat, and you to Entertain.</l>
<l>That for his safety fought beyond the Main.</l>
<l>Your Courage There, but Here your Mercy show;</l>
<l>The Brave scorn to insult a Prostrate Poe.</l>

<stage>Spoken by Mr. <hi>Wilks.</hi></stage>
<l>TO you, the Tyrant Criticks of the Age,</l>
<l>To you, who make such Havock on the Stage;</l>
<l>Assault with Fury every coming Scene,</l>
<l>Like Hero's arm'd at <hi>Ramellis,</hi> or <hi>Turin.</hi></l>
<l>Whilst vanquish'd Wit, shrunk from her Native-Glory,</l>
<l>Like the Cow'd <hi>Gaul,</hi> too weakly stands before Ye.</l>
<l>Since then the Poets play this Loosing Game,</l>
<l>I, a poor Suppliant in the Muses Name,</l>
<l>Beg to avert our trembling Author's Fate;</l>
<l>And, like the sad <hi>Bavarian</hi> Advocate,</l>
<l>Resistance Vain, we to your Mercy fly.</l>
<l>And court you now to lay your Thunder by.</l>
<l>Of Slaughter'd Wits, let the Effusion cease,</l>
<l>We, like the Humble <hi>Lewis,</hi> sue for Peace.</l>

<lg>
<l>WHat mighty pains our Scribling Sot has shown,</l>
<l>To Ridicule our Sex, and Praise his own.</l>
<l>As if we Women muster'd all our Charms,</l>
<l>To tempt an odious Fellow to our Arms.</l>
<l><pb facs="6"/>
One Lady proves so fond, or rather mad,</l>
<l>She'd fain confess a Child she never had.</l>
<l>Alas! how many Nymphs about this Town,</l>
<l>Have pretty Moppits, that they dare not own?</l>
<l>Then a West-country Dam'sel trots to Town,</l>
<l>And talks of Paint, False-hair, and Rumpt-up-Gown,</l>
<l>Things which to Men shou'd never be reveal'd,</l>
<l>But equally with Cuckoldom conceal'd.</l>
<l>Yet, tell me, Sirs, don't you as nice appear,</l>
<l>With your false Calves, Bardash, and Fav'rites here?</l>
<stage>[Pointing to her Forehead.</stage>
<l>Nay, in Side-Boxes too, I've often known,</l>
<l>'Mongst Flaxen-Wiggs, Complexions not their own;</l>
<l>Who hiss good Plays, and to <hi>Camilla</hi> fly,</l>
<l>Draw out their Pocket-glasses, Squint, and Cry,</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l><stage>[Sings.]</stage> <hi>These Eyes are made so killing,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
<l>Young Templers too, with upstart forward Graces,</l>
<l>When Pummis-stone has travell'd o're their Faces,</l>
<l>March hither, where Mobb'd Hoods too often ply,</l>
<l>And want a Lodging, tho' Six-stories high;</l>
<l>Where the fond Youth the modest Dame implores,</l>
<l>And at Day-break ejects her out of Doors.</l>
<l>Some Cheapside-Bobbs too trudge it to our Play,</l>
<l>Faith, <hi>Jack,</hi> this <hi>Hay-Market's</hi> a cursed way:</l>
<l>What signifie the Quality or Wits,</l>
<l>The Money, <hi>Daniel,</hi> rises from us Cits.</l>
<l>Who, like Cock-Sparrows, hop about the Benches,</l>
<l>And court, with Six-pences, fat Orange-Wenches.</l>
<l>In short, you Men have more Fantastick ways,</l>
<l>More Follies, than can e're be stuft in Plays:</l>
<l>But since all Satyr's for your Mirth design'd,</l>
<l>Excuse the Errors, which to Night you find,</l>
<l>And to this Play be Gen'rous, Just, and Kind.</l>

<head>ACT I.</head>
<div2 type="scene">
<stage>Enter Mr. <hi>Sharper,</hi> and <hi>Equipage</hi> his Man.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>AS I was saying, Sir, I have advanc'd the Expences of our Summers Expedition from <hi>Epsom</hi> to <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> from <hi>Tunbridge</hi> to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London</hi> here; where instead of Board-wages, I have liv'd upon Hopes that some of these Places wou'd furnish you with a Bubble, and me with my Money; but I see no appearance of it: Therefore pray let you and I discount.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Prithee, <hi>Equipage,</hi> have but Patience to see what this Winter produces.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir; the Affront you put upon me at <hi>Tunbridge</hi> I can't forget, when you had lost fifty Guineas to the Knight upon Honour, and pretended you had sent
<pb n="2" facs="9"/>
me Post to <hi>London</hi> to your Scrutore for the Money, and that I had robb'd you and run away with your Keys; when you ordered me to keep out of the way till he had left the Town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Thou know'st I had no other quibble to avoid paying the Debt, and quitting the Place with Honour: Come, don't reflect upon my Misfortune; we have seen better Summers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>In troth, Sir, I thought <hi>Bath</hi> promis'd well; I am sure 'twas very full of Company; and if you had not fallen in Love, you might have paid me out of the Subscription.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>How must I have liv'd like a Gentleman then, Sirrah? I shall break your Head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>I have done upon that Subject, Sir; I only desire my Discharge and Wages; that's all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Do you know what you ask, <hi>Equipage?</hi> A Gamester and a Soldier are both Sons of Fortune; now to quit my Service, is directly to embroil your self with Fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>I have been embroil'd with her from the first Day I enter'd into your Service: But I thank my Stars I am above Fortune, and design to forsake the World.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, forsake the World!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, I have lately made some moral Reflections on the Uncertainty of worldly Pleasures. I am weary of being well beaten, and ill fed; of passing the Night at a Tavern Door, and the Day in carrying Messages from one Miss to another. In short, Sir, I am weary of the subservient Title, without the subservient Money, and resolve to marry; that is, when I can find a Woman that deserves me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>A difficult matter truly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>So it is, Sir; but this Digression makes you forget that there is a small Rule in Arithmetick to be adjusted. I have serv'd you these eight Years at twenty-five
<pb n="3" facs="10"/>
Crowns a Year, which in plain <hi>English</hi> is forty-two Pounds Sterling; of which I have received now and then a broken Pate: Nevertheless there remains two and forty Pounds; which I desire you'd give me immediately, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Two and Forty Pounds‚Äîa great deal of Money‚Äîeight Years Service; Mercy upon me! How have I had Patience to endure this Dog so long?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>How have I had Patience to stay thus long for my Wages?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Are not you a Rogue, Sirrah?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>And deserve to be hang'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>As Affairs stands now it seems. Whilst I was silent I was a very honest Fellow; but now I ask for my Wages, I'm fit for the Gallows: Faith, Sir, you might be a Duke by your Conscience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sirrah, you know I am good natur'd; hang me if I am not very unwilling to part with thee: I will not turn thee away, go get my Cloak.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>Turn me away! why, 'tis not you that turn me away; 'tis I that turn you away, if you go to that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, we won't dispute about that; thou shalt not leave me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>Be pleas'd to pay me then; for I design the Money for my Wife's Jointure: Look ye, Sir, here's the Receipt ready.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>The Devil's in the Fellow, I think; thy Noddle runs of nothing but thy own Business; prithee let's think a little of mine. Mrs. <hi>Brazen</hi> the Match-maker, is to help me to a <hi>Somersetshire</hi> Widow worth fifty thousand Pound; she's just come to Town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>But pray, Sir, consider my Business.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>I tell you, I am in haste to see her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>'Tis done in one word, Sir; my Wages.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Well, since you are so resolute, we will part, tho' it trouble me never so much. Give me the Receipt: Let's see how you have drawn it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>There, Sir. <stage>[Gives it him.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Now begon; I discharge you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>But my Wages, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Ah, <hi>Equipage, Equipage,</hi> the parting with thee softens me even into Tears. If I stay I shall unman my self: Farewel.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Equi.</speaker>
<p>The Devil! did not I know him well enough not to trust him with the Receipt till I had the Money? But, egad, I'll be even with him one way, I'll have his cowardly Bones well beaten, if my Project takes.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Toy.</speaker>
<p>I can't imagine from whence proceeds this change. You that us'd to love Parks, Plays, Balls, Drawing-Rooms, Picquet, Baslett, and such nice Conversation: You'd not endure my Lady <hi>Lockup,</hi> because she entertain'd you with nothing but railing at her Servants; of their Waste, and her good House-wifery; nor Mr. <hi>Self-love,</hi> because he always got to the Glass before you; my Lady <hi>Wrinkle</hi> laid on too much White, and my Lady <hi>Blouze</hi> too much Red, and Mrs. <hi>Coquet</hi> engross'd the whole Company: My Lady <hi>Prattle</hi> fill'd your Ears with the Beauty and Wit of her Children.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>And is there any thing so disagreeable on Earth, as the Sayings of Miss and Mass repeated: But what of all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Toy.</speaker>
<p>Why then, I wrack my poor Brain in finding out why you spend so much time with your Country Cousin, Mrs. <hi>Dowdy;</hi> who is the very reverse of every thing you us'd to admire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>Charity, <hi>Toylet,</hi> perfect Charity. You know my aukward Cousin wants Instructions: She's left a rich Widow, and comes to <hi>London</hi> on purpose to Dress and make a Figure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toy.</speaker>
<p>Born and bred in <hi>Somersetshire;</hi> never five Miles from Home before, wore the Cloath of her own Spinning, dain'd to make her own Butter, paid the Labourers their Wages on Work-days, and took a Jigg with them on Holy-days. She will make a Figure indeed, by that time the Fashion-mungers have done with her. Pardon me, Madam, if I can't help thinking you have some stronger Motive than Charity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>What does your Wisdom guess?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toy.</speaker>
<p>Why truly, Madam, I should guess your Ladyship may have some small Pulse for the handsome young Officer that Mrs. <hi>Dowdy</hi> is so much affraid you should see, and thrust you into the Bed-Chamber, when he came into the Dining-Room: I remember with what Fury you catch'd up the red-hot Poker, and burnt a Hole through the Door to look at him: <hi>Belvil,</hi> I think they call his Name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>Upon my Life thou hast hit it, Girl; I'll not conceal my Plot, since I design thee Chief Instrument. If you remember, I told you that five Years since I was in <hi>France;</hi> and my Mother's Sister being of the <hi>Romish</hi> Perswasion, had enter'd her self among the <hi>Augustines</hi> in <hi>Paris:</hi> She over-perswaded me to Board there too, hoping (I suppose) from her endeavours to make me quit my Religion, and profess my self a Nun: During my aboad there, this very Gentleman us'd to make me frequent Visits at the Grate; the first time I saw him he came a long with another
<pb n="6" facs="13"/>
that paid a Compliment to a young Lady of the same Convent: Our Acquaintance held near two Months. 'Twas then, <hi>Toylet,</hi> that I felt the force of Love, but not without a thousand Protestations of the same from him. But my Father hearing of my Aunts design, and apprehending my Youth, (for I was then not full sixteen) might be prevail'd upon to change my Faith, sent for me to <hi>England</hi> in such haste, that I was not permitted to stay one Hour in the Monastery after the Messenger arrived; so had no opportunity to inform <hi>Belvil</hi> of my Departure.</p>

<p>I presume you've kept a Correspondence ever since.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>No, I knew not how to direct to him; he told me he had been bred in the <hi>Spanish-Netherlands,</hi> and came to <hi>France</hi> only for his Pleasure: His Parents (he said) were <hi>English,</hi> and he spoke the Language very well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toy.</speaker>
<p>Nor did not you inform him of your Family?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>He often prest it, and I promis'd to satisfie him; but my Father's unexpected Commands broke all our Measures; and from that Day, till I saw him here, I never heard of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toy.</speaker>
<p>And what is your Design now, Madam? I fear he is a Man of Gallantry; besides you know he makes love to your Cousin; you cannot love him still sure?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>Indeed I do; nay more, can love nothing else.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>What will you do with Sir <hi>Charles Richley</hi> then? who your Father upon his Death-Bed enjoyn'd you to marry, whom he contracted you to in your Childhood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>I cannot love him; it was in my Nonage, and the Barter's illegal; and therefore I'll not Mind it; besides I'm inform'd he is in Love elsewhere, and cares as little for me as I for him; and I would not be a Wife i'th' Mode.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toy.</speaker>
<p>In my Opinion, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> has all the Accomplishments of his Sex, and a fair Estate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>I own it; but I have a whimsical Heart, not to be touch'd with Jointures and Settlements.</p>

<speaker>Toy.</speaker>
<p>And if I have any skill in Faces, <hi>Belvil</hi> is a general Lover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>No matter; my Conquest will be the greater to get him from them all; besides, I will run any risk to break this unreasonable Contract.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toy.</speaker>
<p>What you please, Madam; I am ready to convey a Letter or a Message to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>No, I have a Stratagem to try his Temper, and fathom his Inclinations, I do not intend to discover my self to him, till I have him within my Power, beyond a possibility of retreat. Come in with me, and I'll give thee a full Relation, and prepare our selves for my design.</p>

<sp>

<p>I'm sure there's no pleasure in that Business where a Woman is not concern'd.</p>

<sp>

<l><hi>Bright as the Morn, when first the World began,</hi></l>
<l><hi>And I am doom'd to be the happy Man.</hi></l>

<p>I fear so, <hi>Belvil.</hi></p>

<sp>

<p>Then she is in Love with me? where does she live? what's her Name? how dignify'd or distinguish'd? by Mistress, Madam, or Right Honourable‚ÄîMaid, Wife or Widow? Quick, quick disclose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>'Tis <hi>Lucinda.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>The Devil! have you rais'd my expectation to this height, then pall me with an Acquaintance? But what of her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="18"/>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>You brought me into the Danger; I came wounded off, and have no hopes of Cure, but from your roving Temper. You weigh the Sex alike, and without a Pang may give me leave to try my Fortune with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>This comes of carrying a Friend to see one's Mistriss. Why, I thought you had been engag'd from your Childhood. Come will you be upon the square, bring me to your Mistriss; if I like her as well as I do <hi>Lucinda,</hi> perhaps we may agree upon the change.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>I will: she cannot fail to charm thee; all Eyes, but mine, adore her: And sure 'twas the Malice of our Stars caus'd our Fathers to conclude the Match, where Interest only held the Scale, and gentle Love fled from either side: But be serious. How far are you engag'd with <hi>Lucinda?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Faith, 'tis a kind of intricate Story, but you must be satisfied. I have been bred a Soldier of Fortune, and am to this Day ignorant who my Parents were. The Man who took care of me, always told me <hi>England</hi> was my Native Country, taught me the Language; and for ought I know, some travelling Prince begot me: My Foster-Father was in Battle kill'd, and never gave me farther Light: I had still an Inclination to see this Country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>This Story seems Romantick‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>You'll think it so before I have done: Being landed, and travelling with my Servant towards <hi>London,</hi> I lost my way; Night came on; when, at a distance, we discovered Lights and made up to 'em. It proved <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Country House: Her Uncle, Sir <hi>Thomas Beamont,</hi> kindly receiv'd and entertain'd us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>Lucky Chance!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>So it prov'd to them; for that very Night her House was beset with Thieves: Their number must have prevail'd but for our unexpected Aid; we beat them off, preserv'd their Wealth, and perhaps their Lives. The Lady
<pb n="12" facs="19"/>
express'd a thousand Thanks. The old Man grew Inquisitive, who I was, and whence I came. I frankly told him the Story of my Life: He stood amaz'd, and ask'd me fifty Questions, and seem'd surpriz'd at every Answer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>Well; and what ensu'd upon that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Why, he has ever since been mighty fond of me, and forc'd Money upon me, which I could scarcely make him take my Note for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>You're establish'd every way; his kindness promotes you Interest with his Niece.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Quite contrary: His generous Carriage has oblig'd me to swear to him, never to attempt to marry her, if she should consent without his leave, which he seems still averse to. I confess I love her beyond the rest of her Sex, except one I saw thro' a Grate in <hi>France,</hi> that I could never hear of since: yet this restraint keeps me from pressing my Suit for Marriage, and I have too much respect to attempt the other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>Does she know the Injunction?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>No; that he forbad me too‚ÄîBesides, she is devoted to Platonick Notions</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>I never mind that in a handsome Woman: This generous Declaration draws another Question, why do you address Mrs. <hi>Dowdy?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>That's another Injunction of the old Gentleman's, to procure the Writings of an Estate out of her Hands, that her Husband cheated a Relation of his of. You see, Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> I have a World of Business cut out, and have made you entirely my Confident: No foul play; do ye hear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>There can be none with a Prince that aims at universal Monarchy. But setting Love apart, last Night after you left us, there came a Fellow into the Chocolate-House, who pretended he had made a Campaign in the Nature of a Voluntier; and amongst a number of palpable
<pb n="13" facs="20"/>
Lyes, swore, at the Battle of <hi>Blenheim,</hi> he pursu'd a <hi>French</hi> General over the <hi>Danube,</hi> and took him Prisoner on the other side, then brought him over upon his Back; the Enemies Cannon playing at him all the while: The Company laugh'd: I confess it rais'd my Spleen, and I cou'd not forbear saying, That Action was too Glorious in it self to want a Romance to illustrate it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>So I suppose you brought a squabble upon your Hands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>No; he swore, look'd big, bluster'd, and walk'd off.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Robin,</hi> and a Porter.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> here's a Porter with a Letter.</p>

<stage>[Exit Porter.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>

<p>Suppose it true, 'tis not fair to carry a second when the Inviter names none. But 'tis no such thing: Adieu.</p>
<stage>[Exit Sir <hi>Charles.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>If this shou'd be a Duel now‚ÄîI cou'd never forgive my self for letting him go alone, especially if he comes to any harm.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p>Why; suppose he should be kill'd, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Rascal, I had rather suppose you hang'd, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p>A sudden Death prevents a great deal of Vexation, Sir, sometimes</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>How do you make that out?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Robin.</speaker>
<p>Why, when a Man takes his sick Bed, the sad Formalitics that attend it, are more dreadful than Death it self: His Friends and Relations all weeping round his
<pb n="14" facs="21"/>
Bed; a Lawyer, brib'd by his Spouse to urge the Will: That made, the Sorrow is finish'd; each then enquire after their Legacy: And the disconsolate Wife having borrowed a Weed of her Neighbour, is consulting her Glass to see how it becomes her. Her Thoughts are where to find another Husband; the Servants Heads full of their Mourning: So that if the dying Man calls for a Cordial; slap, they give him a Bolous‚ÄîHe desires to be rais'd‚ÄîThey pull away the Pillow.</p>

Now, Sir, a Builet, or an Oilet-hole in the Guts prevents all this.</p>

<p>Ah! the Study's as crabbed as the Law‚ÄîAnd the Practice as unpleasant as Pennance. <hi>Imprimis,</hi> that I must take Pains to make the World understand our Conversation is only Friendship, and tho' no Body will believe me‚ÄîSwear I admire the Beauties of your Mind‚Äîwithout regarding those of your Person‚ÄîProtest I have no desire to Kiss those rosie Lips‚Äîpress that soft white Hand‚Äîand Sigh my Soul, out in your Bosome‚Äî</p>

<sp>
<p><stage>[Lucinda aside,]</stage> The Devil! How the Fellow talks‚Äî</p>
<p><stage>[To him,]</stage> All this you must positively observe‚ÄîBut then consider the freedoms I allow Ballances the restraint. I promise you all publick Marks of my Favour; my Conduct is sincere and open, I hate a false Prude who won't know a Gentleman in Company, tho' three Hours before she had held private Conference with him in her Bed-chamber; that solemnly declares she never writ or receiv'd a <hi>Billet doux</hi> in her Life, and knows at the same time she keeps a Woman on purpose for the Business.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Like your reforming Ladies, who all the while they are giving a young Fellow advice against Wenching, their Looks slyly insinuate a liking to his Person.</p>

<p>Or Mrs. <hi>Prim</hi> the Poetical She-Philosopher, whose Discourse and Writings are fill'd with Honour and strict Rules of Virtue; that vows she cou'd not Sleep if she was

guilty of one criminal Thought‚Äîyet is terribly wrong'd if she has not twice slipt aside for a natural Tympany.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Oh! How I hate the noise of Virtue in my Ears from a Woman‚Äîwhom I know lives by Vice; and 'tis a Maxim with me‚ÄîThat she who rails most, yields soonest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<p>I have the same Opinion of those Men, who boast much of their Secrecy, only for an opportunity to gain something to betray‚ÄîWell, I think our Sentiments agree, therefore I hope you submit to the Conditions.</p>

<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<p>Nay, don't believe I am jealous, but it wou'd touch my Pride, to have it said the Man that I esteem'd worthy to be seen with‚Äîwas Mistress such a Ones conquest‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>So by what I can discover, you'd have me have no other Affair upon my Hands, but waiting upon you to no purpose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<p>To no purpose! Is not Friendship the noblest Aim of human Kind?</p>

<p>Egad and so I did, for she shriek'd out, and drove away like the Devil, when she saw us engag'd.</p>

<p>Nay, if she has such an early Inclination to the <hi>Bath,</hi> thank thy Stars thou art not Marry'd Boy, for the <hi>Bath</hi> is a Pregnant Place; I know a Virgin that went there to be cur'd of the Green-sickness, and came back with a Timpany, ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p>True, because I thought her in the Wrong.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>And have you not promis'd she shall come to my Lodgings to see the Embassadour go by? Do you make any Scruple of letting her be seen in my Company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>No, for I don't think thee Scandalous, and she shall come to thy Lodgings, and I'll come with her; yet this is nothing to the Purpose‚ÄîThou art a pretty Fellow faith‚Äîbut a Little too impudent to expect Twenty Thousand Pound, with nothing but a red Coat and a Commission.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Is this your Probity, I shall begin to suspect every Thing, I find why you extorted the Promise from me, never to marry her without your Consent.</p>

<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>What! do you know of another Marriage Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> ha?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>No, but I know that which you don't know, Boy‚ÄîWhy I'll hold you Fifty Pound you don't know your own Name‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="68" facs="75"/>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>No, that's very hard indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>As hard as it is, 'tis true‚ÄîWhat's your Name now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p><hi>James Belvill,</hi> I never had any other Name that I know of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>Why look ye there now, did not I tell you, you did not know your Name, then there's the Wrigtings again, you young Dog you, which intitles you to Two Thousand a Year, and <hi>James Beamont</hi> Sirrah, ha, ha.</p>

<p>How's this, my Name?</p>

<p>My Brother!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>My Sister!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<p>What is this he I have so often heard you lament? Why did you conceal it from me thus long?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>Her Brother, oh lucky Turn! <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>Because I was resolv'd he should get the Writings of his Estate before he was known, that he might not be plagu'd with Law as I have been.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>Then <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s free. Oh Transport‚ÄîDear Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> unfold.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>Thus then, My Brother was a Merchant, a thriving Man, there were not so many Privateers Abroad in his Time, nor the French so powerful.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Very well, go on Sir <hi>Thomas‚Äî</hi>I shall have a Father at last‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>This Daughter, upon his Death-Bed he bequeath'd to me, you his Son he did not think fit to trust in my Hands, being wheedled by that old Rogue <hi>Roger Dowdy</hi> his Steward, who insinuated that I being next Heir, was not proper for your Guardian, so prevail'd with my Brother to let him have you, and with you the Writings, Care and Management of the Estate‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
<p>Happy Story.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Then you are my Uncle, Sir‚Äî</p>

<sp>
<pb n="69" facs="76"/>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>Certainly Boy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<p>But how are you sure this is my Brother, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>If you'll give me Leave, dear Madam, you shall hear. <stage>[Sliely.]</stage> Your Father left Effects in <hi>Spain,</hi> whether <hi>Dowdy</hi> went to adjust 'em, and with him took this proper Fellow, then an Infant; at his Return pretended he was Dead, and produc'd a forg'd Will, wherein he was left my Brother's Heir, in case of your Death; but I had private Intelligence from <hi>Spain,</hi> that he had Boarded you there, and chang'd your Name to <hi>Belvill‚Äî</hi>I have ever since been in Law with him till he dy'd: I got him into <hi>Chancery</hi> which we call the Court of Equity, but 'tis the Court of the Devil, for the old Rascal brib'd the Lawyers so high, that I have hung there these Twenty Years.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>Oh how my Heart leaps at this Relation. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>I sent for you several Times, but the Distance of Place, and the Man that had the Care of you being a Soldier, you was still remov'd, at last I lost my Intelligence of you in the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> till that lucky Night that brought you to our House, and being weary of Law, I put you upon that Stratagem to get the Writings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>It agrees with every Circumstance of my Life; thus let me pay you a Son's Duty for your Care; <stage>[Kneels]</stage> and now Sister let me Embrace you with a Brother's Love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<p>And all my Passion shall be turn'd to a Sister's Fondness‚ÄîWhilst what I as a Lover lik'd, I recommend to fair <hi>Isabella.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p><hi>Isabella,</hi> oh that Name rouzes a Thought within my Breast, which I cou'd wish for ever lost, since the Cause is never to be found.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>You do not wish to find it I presume, our Inclinations may possibly alter with the Air, we do not breath the same in <hi>London</hi> which we did in <hi>Paris.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Ha!</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
<p>What, another turn?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<p>Pray unriddle this Brother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>You shall know it all at large within; let this suffice at present, this Lady is my Wife by Promise, five Years ago in <hi>France</hi> we plighted Faiths, and nothing now shall part us.</p>
