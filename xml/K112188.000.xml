<div1 type="scene">
<head>SCENE, <stage><hi>The</hi> Piazza <hi>in</hi> Covent-Garden.</stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Goose-cap <hi>and</hi> Sauney, <hi>embracing each other:</hi> Sauney <hi>in a Scotch Dress, and</hi> Goose-cap <hi>in Black, his Coat daub'd all o'er with Snuff, a Dirty Neckcloth round his Neck, and his Peruke hanging to one side.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>YOu're welcome, dear <hi>Sauney,</hi> from the <hi>Northern</hi> Climate to a more Friendly Air, and this famous Metropolis; where your great and exalted Genius will meet with its merited Reward, and your poetical Abilities shine in their full Splendor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>Upon my Soul Man you say too much to an unworthy Brother—I am a Stranger to <hi>England,</hi> but extraordinarily pleas'd with your good Acquaintance, which recompences the Toil of my fatiguing Journey from the City of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Your Toil, my Friend, you'll think the greatest Pleasure of your Life, when you find by my unequall'd Pen your Character is rais'd to the Top Pinacle of Fame—<hi>Virgil</hi>'s Shade will envy the Reputation I am capable of giving you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p><hi>Virgil</hi> was an Eminent Poet: He's unequall'd in this Age, unless it be in you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>You speak like a Man of Judgment, Brother, and I doubt not to convince the ignorant World, that <hi>Virgil,</hi> amidst his soaring Flights and pompous Elegance, was an Ass to <hi>S—l.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>But we shall find it a plaguy Task to persuade the giddy Multitude to this Opinion: You may seem to resemble the Style and Manner of the Ancients, but I fear the Colours are faint, and will not bear Examination—They are <hi>strong and sublime,</hi> we <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>spiritless.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>I thought you Gentlemen had more of the <hi>Hibernian</hi> Quality than to entertain a mean Opinion of your selves, and your own Capacities: Lay aside Humility, if you intend to thrive in the <hi>English</hi> Territories, and let Conceit, Hypocrisy and Pride take place; be bold and audacious in self-praises; learn to Cabal, flatter, and Condemn, and the Game's your own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>To all these I'm a Stranger, my Dear—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>For what did you desert your Native Country?—Can you expect Services from me, and you entirely unqualified?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>But hold! 'tis not too late to learn—I believe I can despise Merit, and for a considerable Sum be a considerable Flatterer; but the greatest Work is to compliment my self.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Pugh, that's the easiest Thing in the World; you've Nature on your side, which incites Fondness in all to Works of their own Production; I can do it with an Air of Gravity, and damn with a Grace the Misbelievers of an Untruth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>But you have the Happiness, Brother, to be Establish'd, and it requires some Time for a Man to be Entered in any thing, altho' it be in Iniquity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Every airy Female tells ye her Ware is the best, most charming, the most inviting, and all that—And cannot we extoll our own Verses, many whereof describe those Beauties they falsly pretend to be Mistresses of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>Woud'nt it be better that like a fair virtuous Woman, we make no Boastings of our selves, but let our own real Worth recommend us to Mankind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="6"/>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>There's no such thing as real Worth, my Friend, 'tis all imaginary: The whole Universe is a sham, and false Representation—Generals are not always made with Fighting, Scholars by Learning, nor Divines by Study: No, Management and Caballing will save infinite Trouble of that kind—'Tis but to place proper Fame-brokers at the most remarkable Parts of the Town, Fellows of good Lungs to bellow out your Praise, the Work is done; the ignorant Populace, fam'd for Credulity, will believe it with as much Eagerness as they entertain Scandal against true Merit; and thus is a Reputation at once acquired.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>But this seems, according to my Notion of Things, to be inconsistent with true Sense, and 'tis contrary to all Scottish Politicks; we are equally backward in Praising as in Condemning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Sense, Sir, is nothing else but a Rule of acting on the Principle of Interest; so that if it promotes my Profit, I'll applaud my self, or any senseless Wretch; and if my Fortune cannot be raised without calumniating what is truly Great and Glorious, the doing it is an Argument of sound Sense, and perfectly consonant with the Dictates of Nature, and the great <hi>SENECA</hi>'s Philosophy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>I cannot be of your Opinion, Brother, I must term that <hi>Abuse,</hi> which you are pleas'd to call Sense, in Spite of the greatest Oratory to recommend it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="7"/>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>You must learn to think more advantagiously, if you expect Prosperity here—But that I may not be tedious in my first Lectures, we'll quit this Conversation, and retire to a House of Diversion in the Hundreds of <hi>Drury;</hi> we'll drink 'till we rival the Sun with our ruddy Complexions; set up all Night with the Moon; lye with half a Dozen Virgins; break all the Windows of the Mansion; and then, like true Sons of <hi>Parnassus,</hi> make a hasty Escape, and pay no Reckoning, but leave that to be accounted for by the Gods.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>Will not the Substitutes of <hi>Venus</hi> exhaust our Poetical Fire?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>No, they'll encrease it.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>But have ye no Salamanders—I fear I shall be metamorphiz'd to a Glow-worm.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>None at all, my Dear—I'll help ye to an agreeable Female with whom Safety will be your Lot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>The Deel damn me, if I don't think the Lot of <hi>Jonas</hi> will be mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>You'll be in no Belly of a Whale, I'll assure ye.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Saun.</speaker>
<p>But perhaps of something worse—or the Jaws of some terrible Monster—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="8"/>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Let not your Courage be cast down—Come, we'll away to Mother <hi>W—yb—ns.</hi></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Smart.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>Have I found my Enemy at last.— <stage>(<hi>To Goosecap</hi>)—</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>I'm an Enemy to nothing, but that Merit which is of a superiour kind, Sir.—Dear <hi>Sauney,</hi> repair to <hi>Button</hi>'s; I'll be with you presently. <stage>(<hi>To</hi> Sauny.)</stage></p>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Sauny.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>Have you any Pretence, Sir, to Merit?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>As much as you have to be a <hi>Coxcomb,</hi> Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>The Coxcomb does not belong to me at present.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>I can write <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> a Capacity you are unacquainted with.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>In your Walk to St. <hi>J—</hi>'s-<hi>street,</hi> there is neither English, Sense, nor Grammar; and your best Pieces of Poetry are but Trifles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>It would be an Honour to you, Sir, to be the Author of such Trifles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>I can receive no Honour from your Accomplishments.—You have by good Fortune indeed wrote one Piece that has sold, but more from the Popularity of the Subject, than the Performance;
<pb n="9" facs="9"/>
your best Scenes of Love are notoriously worse than those of the lowest Poet in this or any other Age.—The few Similies are no way adapted, and really appear like Flowers in a Dunghill.—In your other Poetical Writings all the Beauties are borrow'd: If we divest you of your Thefts, you'll resemble the Crow in the Fable, and little will remain but Froth and Rhime.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Thou foolish Boy, do'st Thee pretend to criticise on the Greatest Genius of the Age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>You may compliment your Genius as you please, and your Friends may give it out, but I shall take Liberty to affirm that 'tis far from being a perfect one in Poetry: A perfect Genius is capable of producing a finish'd Piece of the greatest Length, which is what you will never be Master of.—A few good Lines I confess you sometimes happen to write, but more from a <hi>Flashy Wit,</hi> than a true <hi>Native Genius.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>My Genius is eminently conspicuous in every thing I do—Can you peruse any Performance of mine, where I don't strike out with a surprizing Strength of Poetical Fury?—And in my Odes, my Flights are very Extraordinary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>Your Flights are like those of the Owl, never Soaring or Lofty. If you intend to gain a solid Reputation, you must <hi>strike out</hi> the greatest part of what you have written: Leave off recommending the Works of others, in order to assume the Honour of the Whole yourself, and
<pb n="10" facs="10"/>
blaming that which you cannot mend, for no other Reason than because you've had no Hand in't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Why all this unmerited Calumny?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>Your Talent is Calumny, Brother, tho' preposterously mix'd with Panegyrick.—You can condemn and praise even the same thing, and at such times as it merits neither your Censure, nor Approbation.—You can lampoon your best Friends, and abuse your greatest Benefactors, in their Absence; and, supported by a Gamester, you think to Bully Mankind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>This is provoking with a Vengeance; wou'd any one but a Poet bear all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>You are born to bear the Burthen of your Folly, and the Repetition of your Faults.—A first RateMinister of State was first your Patron; him you've commended to Excess; since you've let fly at him at least twenty Satyrs. On a great Statesman whom you've lately prais'd, first a Satyr, then a Panegyrick: On a certain Noble Lord first a Panegyrick, then a Lampoon: A great Commoner, first a Satyr, then a Compliment; and many other Instances of this kind I could enumerate: And as Hypocrisy is your Principle, the Whigs have your present Praises, but the Tories and Jacobites your Affections.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>If I should gain any Honour by beating of a Monkey, I wou'd do it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>Come on—I've some Inches of my Sword at your Service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>But few Inches for a Lady I presume.—You're a Child, and deserve the Rod—Farewell.</p>
<stage>(<hi>Exit.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>Adieu.—What a vain conceited Wretch is this? He gives me an Aversion to all Poetry and Poets, and almost to my self as one of the Number.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Aimat.</speaker>
<p>Your Servant, Mr. <hi>Smart</hi>—I've been looking for you an Age, and want to consult you in an Affair of the greatest Consequence.</p>

<speaker>Smart.</speaker>
<p>I am at your Service.—What is your Business, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>O Dear Sir, I am much obliged t'ye; but I'm no Angel as yet.</p>

<speaker>Wealth.</speaker>
<p>A Lord Treasurer is nothing to us—We have superior Methods for the acquiring of Fortunes to any of our Treasurers, and can make them attend our Levees with an obsequious Air; they are first to give the Congee on all Approaches.—We expect to be Dukes by Title, and Princes by Possessions.</p>

<p>I can swear gracefully; speak what I never mean incessantly; ravish Virgins decently; lie with other Mens Wives, and beat their Husbands out of Door couragiously; I can contemn my Betters, who have less Money, audaciously: I can flatter, cringe to and carress a Minister of State; build magnificent Houses, and never pay for 'em; Cheat Gamesters, and deceive a Stockjobber.</p>

<l>THE Farce is o'er, I hope my Breth'ren all,</l>

<l>He must Revenge himself without his Cloke;</l>
<l>And, if He'd well his Adversary Cuff,</l>
<l>He shou'd e'en strip himself, and Arm in Buff:</l>
<l>Nor does our Author <hi>Sauney</hi>'s Ire regard;</l>
<l>He's sure his Play will meet with this Reward,</l>
<l>Be Read once through—then curs'd, by Modern Bard.</l>
<l>But he no <hi>Quixot,</hi> nor Knight-Errant, fears,</l>

<l>If Cheats must only Flourish in this Isle,</l>

<l>What may not Villany in Time engage;</l>
<l>And what can we expect will end our Care,</l>
<l>But that we should the worst of Mis'ries share:</l>
<l>But may all <hi>Harpies</hi> this, this, justly see,</l>
<l>That there's a Debt due to their Infamy;</l>
<l>That Halters, Gibbets, and the Ax attend,</l>
