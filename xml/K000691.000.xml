<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. <hi>PAGET.</hi></stage>
<lg>
<l>IN ancient <hi>Greece,</hi> the Infant <hi>Muse</hi>'s School,</l>
<l>Where <hi>Vice</hi> first felt the Pen of <hi>Ridicule,</hi></l>
<l>With honest Freedom and impartial Blows</l>
<l>The <hi>Muse</hi> attack'd each <hi>Vice</hi> as it arose:</l>
<l>No Grandeur could the <hi>Mighty Villain</hi> screen</l>
<l>From the just <hi>Satyr</hi> of the <hi>Comick</hi> Scene:</l>
<l>No Titles could the <hi>daring Poet</hi> cool,</l>
<l>Nor save the great <hi>Right Honourable Fool.</hi></l>
<l>They spar'd not even the Aggressor's Name,</l>
<l>And Publick <hi>Villany</hi> felt Publick <hi>Shame.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Long hath this gen'rous Method been disus'd,</l>
<l>For <hi>Vice</hi> hath grown too great to be abus'd;</l>
<l>By Pow'r, defended from the Piercing Dart,</l>
<l>It reigns, and triumphs in the <hi>Lordly Heart</hi>;</l>
<l>While <hi>Beaus,</hi> and <hi>Cits,</hi> and <hi>Squires,</hi> our Scenes afford,</l>
<l><hi>Justice</hi> preserves the <hi>Rogues</hi> who weild the Sword;</l>
<l>All <hi>Satyr</hi> against her Tribunal's quash'd,</l>
<l>Nor lash the <hi>Bards,</hi> for fear of being lash'd.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But the Heroick <hi>Muse</hi> who sings To-night,</l>
<l>Through these neglected Tracks attempts her Flight:</l>
<l><hi>Vice,</hi> cloath'd with Pow'r, she combats with her Pen,</l>
<l>And fearless, dares the <hi>Lyon</hi> in his Den.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Then only Reverence to <hi>Pow'r</hi> is due,</l>
<l>When <hi>Publick Welfare</hi> is its only View:</l>
<l><pb facs="3"/>
But when the <hi>Champions,</hi> whom the <hi>Publick</hi> arm</l>
<l>For their own Good with <hi>Pow'r,</hi> attempt their <hi>Harm,</hi></l>
<l>He sure must meet the <hi>general Applause,</hi></l>
<l>Who 'gainst those <hi>Traytors</hi> fights the <hi>Publick Cause.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And while these Scenes the conscious <hi>Knave</hi> displease,</l>
<l>Who feels within the <hi>Criminal</hi> he sees,</l>
<l>The <hi>Uncorrupt</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> must smile, to find</l>
<l>No Mark for <hi>Satyr</hi> in his <hi>Generous Mind.</hi></l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>MULLART.</hi></stage>
<lg>
<l><hi>RAPE upon Rape</hi>! what Author ever chose</l>
<l>A Name so sure to make the Fair his Foes!</l>
<l>And, Ladies, I can read in all your Faces,</l>
<l>Our Author is not much in your good Graces;</l>
<l>But pray, confess, does all this Fury fall,</l>
<l>Because these Scenes <hi>Rape upon Rape</hi> we call?</l>
<l>Or is it—that we have no Rape at all?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Our modern Beaus in Vigour are so hearty,</l>
<l>And modern Dames so very full of Vartue,</l>
<l>So scarce immodest Women, Men so urging,</l>
<l>A Rape's almost as common as a—Virgin.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Oh! may our Youth whose Vigour is so parlous,</l>
<l>To <hi>Italy</hi> be wafted with <hi>Don Carlos</hi>;</l>
<l>There should one Victory but give them Scope,</l>
<l>They would not leave one Maidenhead for the Pope;</l>
<l>Or should some new Pope <hi>Joan</hi> the Chair possess,</l>
<l>They'd play the Devil with her—Holiness.</l>
<l>Rape upon Rape should follow Blows on Blows,</l>
<l>And New <hi>Rome</hi> fall, by what the Old arose.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l><hi>Lucretia</hi> surely, tho' her Fame has sounded,</l>
<l>With Ardour for her Country ne'er abounded;</l>
<l>Who so abhorr'd, what had her Country founded.</l>
<l><pb facs="5"/>
Heathenish Wretch! the Pious Christian Wife,</l>
<l>Tho' ravish'd, still contents herself with Life:</l>
<l>So zealous from Self-Murther we refrain,</l>
<l>We live, tho' sure of ravishing again.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>What need has She of Penance or Repenting,</l>
<l>Who undergoes it all without consenting?</l>
<l>She sure, tho' with her Sword <hi>Lucretian</hi> swagger,</l>
<l>Requires a Cordial rather than a Dagger.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But may no fear of Ravishing affright</l>
<l>The beauteous kind Spectators of To-night;</l>
<l>Safe to your Husbands Arms may you escape,</l>
<l>And never know that dreadful thing, a <hi>RAPE.</hi></l>

<stage>Hilaret, Cloris.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HILARET.</speaker>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ELL, <hi>Cloris,</hi> this is a mad Frolick. I am horridly frighted at the Thoughts of throwing my self into the Power of a young Fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clo.</speaker>
<p>It is natural to us to be frighted at first: I was in a little Terror my self on my Wedding-Day, but it went all off before the next Morning; a Husband, like other Bugbears, loses all his Horror when we once know him thoroughly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>But if he should not prove a good Husband—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clo.</speaker>
<p>Then you must not prove a good Wife—If he keeps a Mistress, do you keep a Gallant; if he
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
stay out with his Friends at a Tavern, do you be merry with your Friends at home.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>You give fine Advice indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clo.</speaker>
<p>Upon my Word, Madam, it was such as I followed my self. I had a Rogue of a Husband that robbed me of all I had, and kept a Mistress under my Nose: but I was even with him: for it hath been ever my Opinion that a Husband, like a Courtier, who is above doing the Duties of his Office, should keep a Deputy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>But suppose you had been in Love with your Husband?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clo.</speaker>
<p>Why so I was, Madam, as long as he deserved it: but Love, like Fire, naturally goes out when it hath nothing to feed on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Well, if it be possible to be assured of a Lover's Sincerity, I think I may be assured of <hi>Constant:</hi> at least it is adviseable to persuade my self of his Truth whom I should Love, tho' he wanted it:—Ah, <hi>Cloris!</hi> you may as easily remove a Rock as a Woman's Passion—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clo.</speaker>
<p>And yet it is very often built on a sandy Foundation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Love is the same, whatever be its Object: We as often like Men for imaginary as real Perfections; we all look through a Prismatick Glass in Love, and whatever Beauties we have once fancied, we never lose the Opinion of—our Amorous Faith is as implicit as our Religious.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clo.</speaker>
<p>If I have any Judgment in Mankind, and I am sure I have had some Experince in them, your Passion could have been no where better fixed: Capt. <hi>Constant</hi> hath all the Qualities any Woman can desire. He hath Youth, Beauty, Vigour, Gallantry, Constancy, and as Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> says, a long <hi>&amp;c.</hi></p>

<head>SCENE II.</head>
<stage>Politick, Hilaret, Cloris.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>Ay there it goes, tick tack, tick tack, like the Pendulum of a Clock. What Mischief are you hatching,
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
hey?—It is impossible that two Women should be together without producing Mischief.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clo.</speaker>
<p>I always thought a Man and Woman the more likely to produce Mischief: and yet I think them the properer Company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>I suppose you will tell my Daughter so too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Indeed Papa she need not: for I was always of that Opinion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>You was! but I shall prevent your Wishes—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>You may be mistaken.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>I do not believe the Head of Cardinal <hi>Fleury</hi> can be more perplexed, than mine is with this Girl. To govern your self, is greater than to govern a Kingdom, said an old Philosopher; and to govern a Woman is greater than to govern twenty Kingdoms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>I wish you would not perplex your self with Cardinals or Kingdoms, I wish you would mind your own Business, instead of the Publick's; dear Papa, don't give your self any more trouble about <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> unless you can get him for a Son-in-Law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>Not if I were a King. I will make you a little sensible who <hi>Don Carlos</hi> is.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I do not understand one Word of your Politicks.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>I am sorry you do not—A News-Paper would be a more profitable Entertainment for you than a Romance. You would find more in one half Sheet, than in the grand <hi>Cyrus.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>More Lies very probably—You know I do read the Home Paragraphs in the <hi>Whitehail</hi> Evening Post: and that's the best of them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>If you would be informed in these Matters, you must read all that come out: about forty every Day, and some Days fifty: and of a <hi>Saturday</hi> about fourscore. Would you continue in such a Course but one Twelvemonth, I do not question but you might know as much of Politicks as—any Man that comes to our Coffee-house. And I had rather see you a Politician, than a Woman of Quality.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>If I may speak freely, it would have been better for me that you had been less a Politician.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>You are deceived, very much deceived: but some Fool hath put this into your Head. You may live to see me one of the greatest Men in <hi>England.</hi> Did I not say at the Siege of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> that within one three Years, we should see whether we should have Peace or no. And yet I am an <hi>Ignoramus</hi>; I know nothing I warrant you: I had better have continued a Merchant no doubt: but then what had become of my Projects? where had been all those twenty different Schemes which I have now ready to lay before the Parliament, greatly for my own Honour and the Interest of my Country? Harkye, I have contrived a Method to pay off the Debts of the Nation, without a Penny of Money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>And you will not get a Penny by it, I dare swear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>No, no, no certainly: tho' I would not take twenty thousand Pounds for the Advantage which will arise to me from it. It hath lain these three Years in a Friend's Hands of mine of the House of Commons; who assured me not many Days ago that it should be taken shortly into Consideration, tho' he believed it could not be this Sessions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Nor this Age, I am confident.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>And how do you think it is to be compassed! why, by procuring a Machine to carry Ships by Land about a hundred Miles: and so prosecute the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, thro' the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi></p>
</sp>

<p>Sir, I look on <hi>Don Carlos</hi> to be an errant Blank in the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi>—and let me observe to you, the <hi>Turks</hi> give me much greater Uneasiness than <hi>Don Carlos</hi> can: What the design of their Preparations can be, is difficult to determine—this I know, that I know nothing of the matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dab.</speaker>
<p>I think we have no need to travel so far for Apprehensions, when Danger is so near us: the Prospect of Affairs in the <hi>West</hi> is so black, that I see no Reason to regard the <hi>East</hi>: the monstrous Power which <hi>Don Carlos</hi> may be possessed of by the Death of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>—</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>As large as the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>—you might as well compare this Tobacco-Pipe to a Canon. Why <hi>Tuscany,</hi> Sir, is only a Town, a Garrison to be admitted into <hi>Tuscany</hi>; that is, into the Town of <hi>Tuscany</hi>—</p>

<p>My Daughter gone! that is some allay to my Happiness, I confess: but the loss of twenty Daughters would not balance the Recovery of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>—However, Gentlemen, you will excuse me, I must go enquire into this Affair.</p>

<p>Why, thou wilt not leave us yet, and sneak away to some nasty little Whore? A Pox confound them, they have spoiled so many of my Companions, and forced me to Bed sober at three-a-Clock in the Morning so often—that if the whole Sex were going to the Devil, I would drink a Bumper to their good Journey.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ram.</speaker>
<p>And I would go thither along with them. The dear charming Creatures! Woman! It is the best Word that ever was invented. There's Musick, there's Magick in it. <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> knew well to lay out his Money, and when he gave the World for a Woman—he bought a lumping Pennyworth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>If he had given it for a Hogshead of good Claret, I would have commended the Purchase more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Wine is only the Prologue to Love: it only serves to raise our Expectation. The Bottle is but a Passport to the Bed of Pleasure. Brutes drink to quench their Appetites—but Lovers to enflame them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>'Tis Pity the generous Liquor should be used to no better a Purpose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>It is the noblest use of the Grape, and the greatest Glory of <hi>Bacchus</hi> is to be Page to <hi>Venus.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>Before I go into a Tavern again with a Man who will sneak away after the first Bottle, may I be cursed with the odious sight of a Pint as long as I live: or become Member of a City-Club where Men drink out of Thimbles, that the Fancy may be heightened by the Wine, about the same time that the Understanding is improved by the Conversation: I'll sooner drink Coffee with a Politician, Tea with a fine Lady, or 'Rack Punch with a fine Gentleman, than thus be made a Whetstone of, to sharpen my Friends Inclinations, that some little Strumpet may enjoy the Benefit of that good Humour which I have raised.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Why, thou art as ill-natured and as angry as a Woman would be, who was disappointed in the last Moment, when her Expectations were at the highest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>And have I not the same Cause?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Truly, honest <hi>Nol,</hi> when a Man's Reason begins to stagger, I think him the properest Company for the Women: One Bottle more, and I had been fit for no Company at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>Then thou hadst been carried off with Glory.—An honest Fellow should no more quit the Tavern while he can stand, than a Soldier should the Field; but you fine Gentlemen are for preserving your selves safe from both, for the Benefit of the Ladies.—'Sdeath! I'll use you with the same Scorn that a Soldier would a Coward: So, Sir, when I meet you next, be not surprized if I walk on the other side the way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Nay, pr'ythee, dear <hi>Silenus,</hi> be not so enraged; I'll but take one refreshing turn, and come
<pb n="9" facs="15"/>
back to the Tavern to thee. <hi>Burgundy</hi> shall be the Word, and I will fight under thy Command till I drop.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>Now thou art an honest Fellow—and thou shalt Toast whomsoever thou pleasest.—We'll bumper up her Health, till thou dost enjoy her in Imagination. To a warm Imagination there is no Bawd like a Bottle. It shall throw into your Arms, the soberest Prude or wildest Coquet in Town; thou shalt rifle her Charms, in spight of her Art. Nay, thou shalt encrease her Charms more than her Art: and when thou art surfeited with the luscious Pleasure, wake cooly the next Morning, without any Wife by your side, or any fear of Children.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>What a luscious Picture hast thou drawn!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>And thou shalt have it, Boy! thou shalt triumph over her Virtue, if she be a Woman of Quality—or raise her Blushes, if she be a common Strumpet. I'll go order a new Recruit upon the Table, and expect you with Impatience—<hi>Fill every Glass.</hi></p>

<p>(Whu— <stage>[whistles]</stage> Ignorance of your Quality!

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>You look, Sir, so much like a Gentleman, that I am persuaded this Usage proceeds only from your mistaking me. I own it looks a little odd for a Woman of Virtue to be found alone in the Street, at this Hour—</p>

<p>But when you know my Story, I am confident you will assist me, rather than otherwise. I have this very Night escaped with my Maid from my Father's House; and as I was going to put my self into the Hands of my Lover, a Scuffle happening in the Street, and both running away in a Fright to avoid it, we unluckily separated from each other—Now, Sir, I relie on the Generosity of your Temper to assist an unhappy Woman, for which you shall not only have my Thanks, but those of a very pretty Fellow into the Bargain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>I am that very pretty Fellow's very humble Servant. But I find I am too much in Love with you my self, to preserve you for another: Had you proved what I at first took you for, I should have parted with you easily; but I read a Coronet in your Eyes: (she shall be her Grace if she pleases, I had rather give her a Title than Money)</p>

<p>One is an Half-pay Officer; another an Attorney's

</sp>
<sp>

<p>Discharge the Officer and the Clerk, there is nothing to be got by the Army or the Law; the one hath no Money, and the other will part with none. But be not too forward to quit the <hi>Templers.</hi></p>
</sp>

<p>Asking your Worship's Pardon, I don't care to run my Finger into the Lion's Mouth. I would not willingly have to do with any Limb of the Law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Fear not; these bear no nearer Affinity to Lawyers, than a Militia Regiment of Squires do to Soldiers; the one gets no more by his Gown, than the other by his Sword. These are Men that bring Estates to the <hi>Temple,</hi> instead of getting them there.</p>

<p>I'll secure them.—We went to the House where your Worship commanded us, and heard the Dice into the Street, but there were two Coaches with Coronets on them at the Door, so we thought it proper not to go in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>You did right. The Laws are Turnpikes, only made to stop People who walk on Foot, and not to interrupt those who drive through them in their Coaches.—The Laws are like a Game at Loo, where a Blaze of Court Cards is always secure, and the Knaves are the safest Cards in the Pack.</p>

<p>You shall, my Dear; and I shall be obliged to you, if you can let me have the Coach this Morning.</p>

<speaker>Mrs. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>I shall use it my self.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Then I must get Horses put into the Chariot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>I am not determined whether I shall use the Coach or Chariot, so it is impossible you should have either. Besides, a Hack is the properest to do Business in, and as I cannot spare you a Servant, will look better.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Well, Child, well, it shall be so.—Let
<pb n="18" facs="24"/>
me only beg the Favour of Dining a little sooner than ordinary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>That is so far from being possible, that we cannot Dine 'till an Hour later than usual, because I must attend at an Auction, or I shall lose a little <hi>China</hi> Basin which is worth its Weight in Jewels, and it is probable I may get it for its Weight in Gold, which will not be above One Hundred Guineas, and those you must give me, Child.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>A Hundred Guineas for a <hi>China</hi> Bason! Oh the Devil take the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade! The Clay of the one <hi>Indies</hi> runs away with all the Gold of the other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>I may buy it for less; but it is good to have rather too much Money about one, than too little.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>In short, I cannot support your Extravagance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>I do not desire you to support my Extravagance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>I wish you would not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Thus stands the Case: You say I am extravagant; I say, I am not; sure, my Word will ballance yours every where but at <hi>Hicks</hi>'s<hi>-Hall.</hi>—And heark'e, my Dear, if whenever I ask for a Trifle, you object my Extravagance to me, I'll be reveng'd, I'll blow you up, I'll discover all your midnight Intrigues, your protecting Ill Houses, your bribing Juries, your snacking Fees, your whole Train of Rogueries. If you do not allow me what I ask, I'll bid fair to enter on my Jointure, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Well, my Dear, this Time you shall be indulged.—Trust a Thief or Lawyer with your Purse, a Whore or Physician with your Constitution, but never trust a dangerous Secret with your Wife; for when once you have put it into her Power to hang you, the sooner you are hang'd, the better.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I have nothing to say against him. I desire you would give us both our Liberty. He was a little frolicksome last Night, which made me call for these People's Help, and when once they had taken hold of us, they would not suffer us to go away.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>They did their Duty.—The Power of Discharging lieth in us, and not in them.</p>
</sp>

<p>Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I beg we may not be interrupted. Heark'e, young Woman, if this Gentleman hath treated you in an ill manner, do not let your Modesty prevent the Execution of Justice. Consider, you will be guilty your self of the next Offence he commits; and upon my Word, by his Looks, it is probable he may commit a Dozen Rapes within this Week.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I assure you he is innocent.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Staff,</hi> what say you to this Affair?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Staff.</speaker>
<p>May it please your Worship, I saw the Prisoner behave in a very indecent manner, and heard the Woman say he had ravished away her Senses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Fye upon you, Child, will you not swear this?</p>

<p>No, Sir; but I shall swear something against you, unless you discharge us.</p>

<p>That cannot be, Madam, the Fact is too plain. If you will not swear now, the Prisoner must be kept in Custody 'till you will.</p>

<p>Very fine, faith! this Justice is worse than a Grand Inquisitor. Pray, honest, formidable Sir, what private Pique have you against me, that you would compel the Lady to deserve the Pillory, in order to promote me higher?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>My Dear, did you ever see such a ravishing Look as this Fellow hath! Sir, if I was a Judge I would hang you without any Evidence at all. They are such Fellows as these who sow Dissention between Man and Wife, and keep up the Names of Cuckold and Bastard in the Kingdom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if that be all you accuse me of, I will confess it freely, I have employ'd my Time pretty well: Tho' as I do not remember ever to have done you the Honour of Dubbing, Mr. <hi>Justice,</hi> I cannot see why you should be so incensed against me; for I do not imagine you any otherwise an Enemy to these Amusements, than a Popish Priest to Sin, or a Doctor to Disease.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>You are very civil, Sir, to threaten to dub my Husband before my Face.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>I ask Pardon, Madam; I did not know with whom I had the Honour to be in Company; it was always against my Inclination to affront a Lady; but a Woman of your particular Merit, must have claimed the most particular Respect.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>I should have expected no Rudeness from a Gentleman of your Appearance, and would much rather attribute any misbecoming Word to Inadvertency, than Design.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I know not how to thank so much Goodness; but do assure you, I would buy an Introduction to your Acquaintance at a much greater Danger than this Prosecution, which, I believe, you already see the Malice of. I hope, Madam, I stand already acquitted in your Opinion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>I hope, Sir, it will only appear to have been a Frolick: I must own I have been always a great Enemy to Force—since there are so many willing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Well, Child, can you find any thing against this Gentleman?</p>

<p>The Woman is difficult of confessing in publick: but I fancy when I examine her in private I may get it out of her—So, Mr. <hi>Constable,</hi> withdraw your Prisoner.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Nay he appears so much of a Gentleman, that till there be stronger Evidence, I will take Charge of him—Come, Sir, you shall go drink a dish of Tea with me—You may stay without.</p>

<p>Come, come, Child, you had better take the Oath, tho' you are not altogether so sure. Justice should be rigorous.

<p>Would you persuade me to perjure my self?</p>

<p>By no means. Not for the World. Perjury indeed! do you think I do not know what Perjury is, better than you? He did attempt to Ravish you, you own; very well. He that attempts to do you an Injury, hath done it in his Heart.

<p>Come, come, I see you are but a Novice, and I like you the better: For yours is the only Business, wherein People do not profit by Experience—You are very handsome—It is Pity you should continue in this abandoned State—Give me a Kiss—Nay be not coy to me—I protest you are as full of Beauty as the Rose is of Sweetness, and I of Love as its Stalk is full Briars—Oh! that we were as closely joined together too.</p>

<p>Ay, this it is to teach Daughters to write.

<p>Well, Sir, is the Lady determined to swear stoutly?</p>

<p>Truly, it is hard to say what she determines; she is gone to ask the Advice of a Divine and a Lawyer.</p>
</sp>

<p>Then the odds is against me: for the Lawyer will certainly advise her to swear, and it is possible the Priest may not contradict her in it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>It is indeed a ticklish Point, and it were advisable to make it up as soon as possible. The first Loss is always the least. It is better to wet your Coat than your Skin, and to run home when the Clouds begin to drop, than in the middle of the Storm. In short, it were better to give a brace of hundred Pounds to to make up the Matter now, than to venture the Consequence. I am heartily concerned, to see a Gentleman in such a Misfortune. I am sorry the Age is so corrupt. Really I expect to see some grievous and heavy Judgment fall on the Nation. We are as bad as ever <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were, and I wish we may not be as miserable.</p>

<p>A Gentleman, and poor! Sir, they are Contradictions. A Man may as well be a Scholar without Learning, as a Gentleman without Riches. But I have no time to dally with you. If you do not understand good Usage, while it is dealt you, you may, when you feel the Reverse. The Affair may now be made up for a Trifle; the time may come when your whole Fortune would be too little—An Hour's Delay in the making up an Offence is as dangerous as in the sewing up of a Wound.</p>

<p>That I do indeed. And to give you the most substantial Instance of it, I will ask a Favour, which is expected only from the most intimate Friendship—which is, that you would be so kind to lend me the Money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Alack-a-day, Sir, I have not such a Sum in my Command. Besides, how must it look in me, who am an Officer of Justice, to lend a Culprit Money wherewith to evade Justice! Alas, Sir, we must consider our Characters in Life, we must act up to our Characters; and tho' I deviate a little from mine, in giving you Advice, it would be entirely forsaking the Character of a Justice to give you Money.</p>

<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>But me no buts—what can be the Reason of all this warlike Preparation, which all our Newspapers have informed us of. Yes, and the same Newspapers a hundred times in the same Words. Is the Design against <hi>Persia?</hi> Is the Design against <hi>Germany?</hi> Is the Design against <hi>Italy</hi>—Suppose we should see <hi>Turkish</hi> Gallies in the Channel? We may feel them, yes, we may feel them in the midst of our Security; <hi>Troy</hi> was taken in its Sleep, and so may we.</p>

<p>Sure, Sir, you are asleep, or in a Dream—</p>

<p>Yes, yes, these things are called idle Dreams—the justest Apprehensions may be styled Dreams—but let me tell you, Sir, Men betray their own Ignorance often, in attacking that of other Men.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>But what is all this to your Daughter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>Never tell me of my Daughter, my Country is dearer to me than a thousand Daughters; should the <hi>Turks</hi> come among us, what would become of our Daughters then? and our Sons, and our Wives, and our Estates, and our Houses, and our Religion, and our Liberty.—When a <hi>Turkish</hi> Aga should command our Nobility, and Janizaries make Grandfathers of Lords? Where should we look for <hi>Britain</hi> then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>Truly, where I may look for Mr. <hi>Politick</hi> now, in the Clouds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>Give me leave, Sir, only to let you a little into the present State of <hi>Turkey.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>I must beg to be excused, Sir; if I can be of any Service to you, in relation to your Daughter, you may command my Attention: I may probably defend you from your own Countrymen, but truly from the <hi>Turks</hi> I cannot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>I am glad to hear you have some Apprehension of them, as well as my self.—That you are not so stupidly besotted, as I meet with some People at the Coffee-house; but perhaps you are not enough apprized of the Danger. Give me leave only to shew you, how it is possible for the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to find an Ingress into <hi>Europe.</hi>—Suppose, Sir, this Spot I stand on to be <hi>Turkey</hi>—then here is <hi>Hungary</hi>—Very well—here is <hi>France,</hi> and here is <hi>England</hi>—granted—then we will suppose he had Possession of <hi>Hungary</hi>—what then remains but to conquer <hi>France,</hi> before we find him at our own Coast.—But, Sir, this is not all the Danger; now I will shew you how he can come by Sea to us.</p>

<p>It would be unpardonable in me to entertain so flagrant a Belief at the first hearing, against a Man who hath given me such substantial Proofs of his Constancy: Besides, an Affair of my own makes me the more doubtful of the Truth of this; but if there appear any Proof of such a Fact I will drive him for ever from my Thoughts.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>You would not take my Advice. I have cautioned thee never to trust any thing on the same Bottom with a Woman. I would not ensure a Ship that had a Woman on Board, for double the Price.—The Sins of one Woman are enough to draw down a Judgment on a Fleet.</p>

<p>Nor ever will—I heartily hope. Tho' as for the Innocent Chests, those I wish deliver'd out of the

<p>The most impudent Fellow, sure, that ever was born!</p>

<p>So; my Affair with my Friend's Mistress is happily over.—That I should not know a modest Woman!

<p>From your great Humanity, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Alas, Sir! it was to try whether you were really the Man you were reported to be; and I am certain I found you as inoffensive, quiet, civil, well-bred a Gentleman as any virtuous Woman could have wished. Your Behaviour was so modest, that I can never imagine it possible you should have been guilty of a Rape. No over-grown Alderman of Sixty, or taper Beau of Six and Twenty, could have been more innocent Company.</p>

<p>I'll take care, Madam, never to forfeit your good Opinion of me; you may trust your self with me any where; I'll never behave in any other manner than becomes the best-bred Man alive with the best-bred Lady.

That Consideration may sufficiently compensate the staying of my Stomach. This Adventure of mine begins to put on a tolerable Aspect. An Intrigue with a rich Justice's Wife, is not to be slighted by a young Fellow of a desperate Fortune. I do not doubt but in a very short Time, when I am taken up for the next Rape, to bribe the Justice with his own Money.—Lend a Man your Gold, he may forget the Debt; venture your Life for him, he may forget the Obligation; but once engage his Wife, and you secure his Friendship. There is no Friend in all Extremity so sure as your

There is no Honesty in Man or Woman, that will not drink. Honesty is tried in Wine, as Gold is in the Fire. Madam, you have made a Conquest of me. I'll drink your Health as long as I can stand, and that's as long as a reasonable Woman can require.</p>

<p>It was because they none of them had your Merit; a Parcel of Tea-drinking Sluts.—If I had a Daughter that drank Tea, I would turn her out of Doors.

<p>Of what, Sir?</p>

<p>I am afraid that I am not the only Person free with her, and that I am free of the Corporation of Cuckolds.</p>

<p>Then your Worship is free of all the Corporations in <hi>England.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Now thou knowest that there are very wholesome Laws against Cuckoldom; the Advantage of a Man's Horns is, that he may shove his Wife out of Doors with them.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Quill.</speaker>
<p>And that is no inconsiderable Advantage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>But there must be a Discovery first. It is not enough that a Man knows himself to be a Cuckold, the World must know it too. He that will keep his Horns in his Pocket, must keep his Wife in his Bosom. Therefore, <hi>Quill,</hi> as it is in your Power to observe my Wife, I assure you a very handsome Reward on her Conviction; for I begin to find, that if I do not discover her, she will shortly discover me, or ruin me by bribing her to hold her Tongue.

<p>Never fear him! he hath Cunning enough, and there hath been so long a War in his Head between Wine and his Senses, that they seem now to have come to an Agreement that he is never to be quite in them, nor ever quite out of them; his Life is one continued Scene of being half Drunk.</p>

<p>Well, as we can be of no farther Use in the Affair, but must stay here and expect the Issue; pr'ythee tell me what hath become of you these three long long Years since you quitted the Service of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, and came over to <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Sotmore?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Why, at my first Return to <hi>England,</hi> the Prospect of War was in every one's Eye, and not only the Reports of the People, but the Augmentation of the Troops assured us of its Approach; upon which, I resolved to embarque my small Remains of Fortune in the Service of my Country, and obtained the same Commission on that Occasion, which I had enjoyed in the <hi>Indies.</hi> My History is not very full of Adventures; I continued therein 'till the Reduction, when I shared the Fate of several unhappy brave Fellows, and was sent a begging with a red Coat on my Back.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>It is the Faculty of the Cloth to be ragged.—Red is as apt to be ragged, as White to be soil'd. It is commonly the Fate of our brave Soldiers to bring home ragged Cloaths, as well as Colours, and both are rewarded by <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi>—the one is hung up in it, and the other is locked up safe by an Order from it; for, Heaven be prais'd! the Goals are always open Hospitals for us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="49" facs="55"/>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>The only Happiness which hath attended me since my Return, is my having contracted an Intimacy with that young Lady whom you saw here; which hath proceeded so far, that last Night we had appointed to meet in order to our Marriage; but as I was just arrived at the Place, a Woman well-dress'd was attacked in the Street by a Russian; I immediately flying to her Assistance, the Fellow quitted her, and left me alone in the Possession of the Watch, who early this Morning carried me before Justice <hi>Squeezum,</hi> and by him I was committed hither.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>What, did she appear against you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>No; they said she was ill of some Bruises she had received, but desired I might be kept in Custody 'till the Afternoon, at which Time she would appear against me. But by what <hi>Hilaret</hi> hath told us, and by some Methods which have been used to extort Money from me, I am inclined to fancy it all a contrived Piece of Villany of the Justice, and not of the Woman's, as I at first imagined.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Be assured of it;—if there be Roguery, the Justice hath the chief Part in it. But, comfort your self with the Expectation of Revenge, for I think he cannot possibly escape the Net we have spread, unless the Devil have more Gratitude than he is reported to have, and will assist his very good Friend at a Crisis.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>But, what do you intend in <hi>England,</hi> where you have no Friends?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>I know not yet whether I have or no. I left an old Father here, and a rich one. He thought fit to turn me out of Doors for some Frolicks, which it is probable, if he yet lives, he may have forgiven me by this. But what's become of him I know not, for I have not heard one Word of him these Ten Years.</p>

<p>I think you have been vastly careless, in neglecting him so long.</p>

<p>'Tis as I have acted in all Affairs of Life; my Thoughts have ever succeeded my Actions; the

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Do—and leave Word if any such comes, to shew her up hither.—I have no Reason to doubt her Company, but I am impatient for it. I protest this Woman hath revived the Vigour of Youth in me; sure, I must have over-reckoned my Years!—I cannot be above Forty-Nine at the most.—I wish this dear Girl was come.—I am afraid I did wrong in giving her those Five Shillings, in a Purse worth above Two Shillings more, which who knows but she may be spending on some Bully, who will perhaps send another Present to me in return?</p>

<p>Oh! are you come—you little, pretty, dear, sweet Rogue!—I have been waiting for you these—these four Hours at least.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Young Lovers are commonly earlier than their Appointment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Give me a Kiss for that.—Thou shalt find me a young Lover, a vigorous young Lover too.—Hit me a Slap in the Face, do.—Bow-wow! Bow-wow! I'll eat up your Cloaths.—Come, what will you drink? White or Red?—Women love White best.—Boy, bring half a Pint of <hi>Mountain.</hi>—Come, sit down; do, sit down.—Come, now let us hear the Story how you were first debauched.—Come—that I may put it down in my History at Home. I have the History of all the Women's Ruin that ever I lay with, and I call it, <hi>The History of my own Times.</hi></p>

<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>I'll warrant it is as big as a Church-Bible.</p>

<p>It is really of a good reputable Size: I have done Execution in my Time.</p>

<p><stage>[Without.]</stage> Half a Pint of Mountain in the <hi>Lion,</hi> score.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Well—But now let me have the History—Where did your Amour begin—at Church, I warrant you: more Amours begin at Church than end there.—Or perhaps, you went to see the Man of War—Going to see Sights hath ruined many a Woman. No wonder Children are Lovers of them, since so many owe their Being to them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside.]</stage> I thank you for that remembrance, I had forgot my Lover.—Ay, Sir, it was there indeed I saw him first, that was the fatal Scene of our Interview.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Well, and was the Amour managed by Letter, or by word of Mouth?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>By Letter, Sir. I believe he writ two Quires of Paper to me before I would send him an Answer, I returned him several un-opened, and then several others opened—But at last—he obtained an Answer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Well, and after your Answer, what followed then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Oh! he thought himself sure of me, as soon as I had answered his Letter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Ay, I have always observed in my Amours, that when I received an Answer, I never failed of the Woman; a Woman follows her Letter infallibly: well, and what did he say in the second Letter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Oh! he swore a thousand fond things, that his Love should last as long as his Life. That his whole Happiness depended on me—and a vast deal of that Nature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, just as I have done my self. I find Whoring is as Methodical as the Law.</p>

<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Well, and how many Letters did you write to him, ey!—before—?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Not many. He did not want much Encouragement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Then passing over the rest of the Suit, let us come to the last fatal Meeting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>It was of a <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Right. My old method: When other People are gone to Church.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>In an exceeding hot Day.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p><hi>May</hi> or <hi>June?</hi>—Women and Cherries are commonly gathered in the same Month.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>I was fatigued with walking in the Garden, and retired to an Arbour to repose my self: guess what was my Surprize, when I found the dear Perfidious had convey'd himself thither before me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>A sly Dog! My old way again. An Ambush is as useful in Love as War.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>At my first Entrance, he pretended a Surprize at seeing me unexpectedly: but on my questioning him how and with what Design he had conveyed himself there, he immediately threw off the Cloak and confessed all: he flew to me, caught me in his Arms with the most eager Raptures, and swore the most violent Love and eternal Constancy. I in the greatest Agony of Rage repelled him with my utmost Force; he redoubled his Attacks, I slackened my Resistance; he entreated, I raved; he sighed, I cry'd; he pressed, I swooned; he—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Oh!—I can bear no longer, my Angel! my Paradise! my Honey-suckle! my Dove! my Darling!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>I mean to eat you up, to swallow you down, to squeeze you to Pieces.</p>

<p>Help there! a Rape, a Rape!</p>

<p>Oh! for Heaven's sake, Sir, assist a poor forlorn, hapless Maid, whom this wicked Man hath treacherously seduced.</p>

<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Oh lud!—Oh lud!</p>

<sp>

<p>Fie upon you, Mr. <hi>Squeezum</hi>! you who are a Magistrate, you who are the Preserver and Executor of our Laws, thus to be the Breaker of them!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Can'st thou accuse me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>You know too well how barbarously you have used me. For Pity's sake, Sir, secure him; do not let him escape, 'till we send for a Constable. If there be any Law for a Justice, I am resolved to hang him.</p>

<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Oh lud! what Shame have I brought my self to! that ever I should live to see this Day!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>If thou hadst stood to thy Bottle like an honest Fellow this had never happened, but you must go a Whoring with a Pox to you, at your Years too; with these spindle Shanks, that weezle Face, that Crane's Neck of a Body. Who would have imagined that such an old withered May-pole as thou art should attempt to fall on a Woman? Why, thou wilt be the Diversion of the whole Town.—<hi>Grubstreet</hi> will dine a Month on your Account. Thou wilt be ushered to <hi>Tyburn</hi> with more Pomp then <hi>Alexander</hi> was ushered into <hi>Babylon.</hi> Justice never triumphs so universally as at the Execution of one of her own Officers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Sir, if there be Truth on Earth, I am as innocent—</p>

<speaker>Sotm.</speaker>
<p>All the Innocence on Earth will not save you—A Man doth not always draw the Rope by the weight of his Sins. Your Innocence will not acquit you in a Court of Justice, against her Oath; and when you come to the Gallows, it will be vain to plead your Innocence. All's Fish that comes to the Net there. The Gallows so seldom gets its due, that it never parts with what it gets.</p>

<p>Ay, ay, I can swear to the Rape with as safe a Conscience as I can drink a Glass of Wine.</p>

<p>I see I am betrayed, I am caught in my own Trap.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Sir, if you would give me Millions, it should not satisfie my Revenge; you shall be hanged for an Example to others.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Here's a cruel Wretch! who prefers my Blood to my Gold, which is almost my Blood.</p>

<speaker>Sotm.</speaker>
<p>Hey-day! what Vehicle is this? a Vinegar Bottle?—half a Pint, by <hi>Jupiter!</hi> Why, thou sneaking Rascal, can'st thou pretend to Honesty, when this Dram Glass hath been found upon thee? Were I thy Judge, or thy Jury, this very sneaking Vehicle should hang thee, without any other Evidence. But come, since you are to be hanged, I'll drink one Bumper to your good Journey to the other World—You will find abundance of your Acquaintance, whom you have sent before you—And now, I'll go call the Drawer to fetch a Constable.</p>

<p>Hold, hold, Sir; for Mercy sake do not expose me so—Will nothing content you, Madam?</p>

<p>Let a Woman alone for a Plot, Mr. <hi>Sotmore.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Madam, a Woman that will drink a Bumper. Wine is the Fountain of Thought, and</p>
<l>The more we drink,</l>
<l>The more we think.</l>
<p>It is a Question with me, whether Wine hath done more Good, or Physick Harm in the World; I would have every Apothecary's Shop in the Town turn'd into a Tavern.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="57" facs="63"/>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>I am afraid the more you have of the one, the more you will require of the other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>It is their Drugs that debauch our Wine: Wine in it self is as innocent as Water, and Physick poisons both. It is not the Juice of the Grape, but of the Drug, that is pernicious. Let me advise you, Madam, leave off your damn'd adulterated Water, your Tea, and take to Wine. It will paint your Face better than Vermilion, and put more Honesty in your Heart than all the Sermons you can read. I'll introduce you to some Clubs of my Acquaintance, a set of honest Fellows that live in the Clouds of Tobacco, and know no Home but a Tavern.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>This Letter, Sir, will produce the Gentleman immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>Here, Drawer—let this Letter be sent whither it is directed. Come honest Justice, our Acquaintance hath an odd Beginning, but we may be very good Companions soon: Let us sit down and expect our Friend in the Manner it becometh us. Remember what you have bargained to do every Day of your Life, and the Obligation shall be dated from this Hour. Come, sit thee down, honest Publican, old Justice Merchant. <stage>[They sit]</stage> Here's a Health to the Propagation of Trade, thy Trade I mean, to the Encrease of Whores, and false Dice—Thou art a Collector of the Customs of Sin, and he that would sin with Impunity, must have thy Permit. Come, pledge me, old Boy; if thou leavest one Drop in the Glass, thou shalt go to Goal yet, by this Bottle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>I protest, Sir, your Hand is too bountiful, you will overcome me with Wine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>Well, and I love to see a Magistrate drunk; it is a comely Sight: When Justice is drunk, she cannot take a Bribe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Do you not remember how the <hi>Athenians</hi> punished Drunkenness in a Magistrate?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>And do not I know that we have no such <hi>Athenian</hi> Law among us? We punish Drunkenness as well as other Sins, only in the Lower Sort: Drink,
<pb n="58" facs="64"/>
like the Game, was intended for Gentlemen—and no one should get drunk, who cannot go home in a Coach—Come, Madam, it is your Glass now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hil.</speaker>
<p>Dear Sir! I beg you would not compel me to it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>By this Bottle, but I will, I'll ravish thee to it before the Justice's Face. Come, it will be better for you than Tea, you will not be obliged to sculk away and take a Dram after this. Come drink the Justice's Health, as a Token of Amity; the Justice is a good honest drunken Fellow. But let me give you some wholesome Advice, <stage>[to the Justice]</stage> leave off fornicating, leave the Girls to the Boys, and stand to thy Bottle: It is a Virtue becoming our Years; and don't be too hard on a wild honest young Rake. Thou hast committed a couple of the pretiest Boys to-day, don't do so any more.—Be as severe as you please to Whores and Gamesters, that offer to act without your License; but if ever you grant a Warrant for a Friend of mine again, you shall not only drink the Wine, but eat the Bottle too. Come, here's your Health, in Hopes of your Amendment; thou shalt pledge thy own Health in a Bumper—Here, Boy, bring up a Gallon of Wine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Not a Drop more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>A Drop! confound the Name. Come, empty your Glass; the Lady is a-dry.</p>

<p>SURE, never Child inherited less of a Father's Disposition than mine; her Mother certainly played me foul in the begetting her: I, who have been my whole Life noted for Sobriety, could never have given Being to so wild a Creature: I begin to recollect having seen a tall Half-pay Officer at my House formerly: Nor do I think the Girl unlike him. I am sure she hath been ever wild enough, to have had any Officer in the Kingdom for her Father. Nature hath been kind to the Male of all Creatures but Man: The Bull, the Horse, the Dog are not encumbered even with their own Off-spring; that Care falls only to the Females: But Man, when once a gabling Priest hath chattered a few mischievous Words over him, is bound to have and to hold from that Day forward all the Brats his Wife is pleased to bestow on him. Yet I must own the Girl hath been ever dutiful to me, till she became acquainted with this cursed Fellow in a Red Coat. Why should Red have such Charms in the Eyes of a Woman? The <hi>Roman</hi> Senate kept their Armies abroad to prevent their sharing in their Lands at home, we should do the same to prevent their sharing in our Wives. A tall lusty Fellow shall make more work for a Midwife in one Winter at home, than he can for a Surgeon in ten Summers abroad.</p>

<p>Sure Modesty is quite banished from the Age we live in. There was a time when Virtue carried something of a divine Awe with it, which no one durst attack; but now the Insolence of our Youth is such, no Woman dare walk the Streets but those who do it for Bread.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>And yet our Laws, Brother <hi>Worthy,</hi> are as rigorous as those of other Countries, and as well executed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>That I wish they were; but Golden Sands too often clog the Wheels of Justice, and obstruct her Course: The very Riches which were the greatest Evidence of his Villany, have too often declared the Guilty innocent; and Gold hath been found to cut a Halter surer than the sharpest Steel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>Well, I am resolved to take care how I venture a step again after it is dark: I find the Sun is the only Guard to us Women; for however chaste the Moon may be in her self, she takes but very little care of ours.</p>

<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>What is the occasion of all this Passion, Mr. <hi>Squeezum?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Occasion! I have scarce Power to tell you. I have discovered one of the most damnable Conspiracies, that hath been invented since the Gunpowder-Treason Plot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>Nothing against the Government, I hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Marry, but it is; for that which is against the Officers of the Government, is against the Government. In short, Sir, it is a Conspiracy against me, against my self. What do you think, Brother <hi>Worthy,</hi> but that moved and seduced by the Instigation of the Devil, a vile Woman hath conspired to swear a Rape against me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>A Rape against you! foolish Jade! Why your very Face would acquit you—you have Innocence in your Looks, Brother <hi>Squeezum.</hi></p>

<p>I hope my Character will acquit me against such an Accusation.</p>

<p>I think it ought; a Man whose Character would not, is very unfit for that honourable Commission you bear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>True! these Slurs reflect on us all. The accusing a Member, is accusing the Body. We should consider it may be our own case. We should stand by one another, as the Lawyers do.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>To discountenance it by the Innocence of our Lives, is indeed laudable, but no farther. It is a cursed Law, which exempts the Maker, or the Executor of it, from its Penalty.</p>

<p>Did you write this Letter, Mr. <hi>Squeezum?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, as I am ready to swear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Squeez.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I will swear it to be his Hand—</p>

<p>And so will I—I lived with him a Twelvemonth, and therefore should know it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>And I carried it to the Lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, Justice, thou hast Proof enough of her Innocence. I will give you the Word of a Man of Honour, which is more than the Oaths of twenty such Scoundrels as these, that she never intended more than to frighten him to the Acquittal of Captain <hi>Constant</hi> here, whom he had unjustly committed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>And offered to acquit for a Sum of Money.</p>

<p>Captain <hi>Constant!</hi> is your Name <hi>Constant,</hi> Sir?</p>

<p>Captain <hi>Constant</hi>! It is happy for me that I do—I thank you, Sir, for your generous Rescue last Night, which my Fright at that time prevented my acknowledging.</p>

<p>And was it you, Madam?—</p>

<p>Very lucky Stars they appear now; but they had a confounded ugly Aspect some time ago.</p>

<p>Surprizing! Brother, let that Fellow be secured. He was the Person from whose Hands this Gentleman delivered me.</p>

<p>Surprizing Villany!—secure them instantly. And particularly that Justice,—whom I shall no longer treat as a Gentleman, but as his Villany hath merited—Constable, I charge you with them all—and let them be kept below in the Parlour, whither I will come immediately and sign their Commitment.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>My dear <hi>Isabella,</hi> I am so overjoyed at this unexpected Meeting, that I do not ask for the Safety of our Treasure. Since the Sea hath refunded <hi>Isabella,</hi> let it take the Jewels.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>The Sea hath been even kinder than your Wish, it hath return'd you both.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>I should have soon forgotten that Loss, in having <hi>Isabella</hi>; yet for her sake, the Teasure is welcome too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Politick,</hi> I am heartily concerned at this Misfortune which hath befallen your Daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Politick!</hi>—By Heavens, his Features are the same. Had you not a Son, Sir, once?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, I had; but I turn'd him out of Doors, and believe he was hanged long ago.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Then I am his Ghost, just arrived from the <hi>Indies.</hi> When you turn'd me out of Doors, I got admitted into the <hi>East-India</hi> Company's Service; I changed my Name in order to escape your Discovery—and I hope you will now give us both your Blessing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>And are you really that wild Follow my Son?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>I am that very identical wild Person, I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>I don't know whether I'll give you my Blessing or no, till I see how you are married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Politick,</hi> I rejoice in the Union of our Families; this Lady, your Son's Wife, is my Sister—and if fourscore thousand Pounds can make the Match agreeable to you, it will be so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="76" facs="82"/>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>Hath the wild Rogue made his Fortune at last! Well, Son, I give you my Blessing; and my dear Daughter I give you Joy, and I hope the Boy will give it you, ay, and lasting constant Joy—If he doth not make you a good Husband, I'll not own him; if he doth not make you blessed, he shall have no Blessing of mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isa.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I doubt him not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Well, Father, I have nothing more to ask of you, but in Favour of my Friend Captain <hi>Constant,</hi> whose Love I am certain will compleat the Happiness of my Sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>I think I have never been witness to such a Complication of Villany. Sir, <stage>[to Constant]</stage> I assure you, and all of you, you shall have sufficient Reparaton for the Injuries you have suffer'd. And Sir, by the Characters which I have had from my Sister of that Gentleman, I do not think your Daughter can be better disposed of, let the Difference of Fortune be what it please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Besides, tho' his Estate be not equal now, it may become so; for no Man hath a better Insight into Politicks.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if his Studies bend that Way, no Man indeed can tell to what his Estate may come—Had I known this sooner, my Doors should never have been shut against him. Sir, I shall be glad to confabulate with you at my House—and if you should set your Heart on my Daughter, I do not believe I shall do any thing to break it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir, there is no Hour like the Present: This Hour hath proved lucky to your Family—Give me leave to present your Daughter to one whom if she deserves, I shall be proud of calling her Sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p><hi>Ramble,</hi> you have crown'd my Obligations with a Gift, far dearer than the Earth could prove.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I only wish you may always think so, Captain. And now, Pappa, I hope you will pardon this Night's Sally, to both me and poor <hi>Cloris</hi>; we have been already

sufficiently punished; and since the Event is happpy, imitate in this one thing the <hi>Turks,</hi> and consider it favourably, as it hath been prosperous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>The <hi>Turks!</hi> I wish you were better acquainted with them than in Romances; I hope that Gentleman will take care to instruct you in publick Affairs.—Well <hi>Jack</hi> <stage>[to Ramble]</stage> I long to have some Communication with you about the Affairs of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the Posture of our Trade there—I hope you left the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> in good Health—</p>

<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p>Very slightly indisposed of a Cold at my Departure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>I heartily forgive you all: So let me see you all embrace one another—This is the Comfort of Age, Mr. <hi>Worthy.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>Let me embrace you all together—I have found this Day two good Women—and they have fallen to the Share of my Friends—and I will get drunk this Night, if the Spirit of Wine will do it—I'll drink to your Happiness, while you are enjoying it—While you are tasting the Joys of <hi>Venus,</hi> I will swallow down the Delights of <hi>Bacchus</hi>—I despair of either of your Company this Month yet—but the Justice shall celebrate this Night with me—Come, honest Justice—I have found one honest Justice too—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>Really, Sir, I think you have sufficiently celebrated already—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sot.</speaker>
<p>No, but I have not—and you, Sir, will be drunk at your Children's Wedding-Night.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Pol.</speaker>
<p>I never drink any thing but Coffee, Sir.</p>

<p>Damn your Coffee—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ramb.</speaker>
<p><hi>Sotmore,</hi> thou shalt have Justice—Mr. <hi>Worthy,</hi> I assure you, notwithstanding this Humour, the World hath not an honester Man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wor.</speaker>
<p>It is pity he should besot himself so. Your Character of him encourages me to employ some Labour in advising him, to quit so beastly a Pleasure.—Come Gentlemen, I desire you would celebrate this Day at my House to-morrow. I will proceed to take
<pb n="78" facs="84"/>
all possible Measures to your receiving Satisfaction for your Injuries, and making publick Example of so great a Villain: for the Crimes of a Magistrate give the greatest Sanction to Sin.</p>
