<p>THE Earl of Warwick, A TRAGEDY, As it is perform'd at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</p>
<p>LONDON: Printed for T. DAVIES, Russel-Street, Covent-Garden; R. BALDWIN, Pater-Noster-Row; and W. GRIFFIN, Catharine-Street, in the Strand. M.DCC.LXVI. [Price ONE SHILLING and SIXPENCE.]</p>

<head>Advertisement. To the PUBLIC,</head>
<p>THE author takes this opportunity to acknowledge his obligation to the public, for their favourable reception of THE EARL OF WARWICK. He flatters himself, that the license so necessary to his plan, which he has taken in common with other writers, in deviating from historical truth, especially in a period so distant and obscure, will meet with indulgence.</p>
<p>For the many faults and imperfections of this piece, he can only plead that title to pardon, which is generally extended in favour of a first essay, and shall hope, that the same candour which approv'd on the stage, will accompany it to the closet.</p>
<p>He cannot, without the most manifest injustice, forbear to add, that the more than ordinary exertion of dramatic powers, display'd by the principal actors concerned in it, contributed in a great measure to the success of the performance.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE,</head>
<byline>Written by GEORGE COLMAN, <abbr>Esq</abbr> Spoken by Mr. BENSLEY.</byline>
<lg>
<l>SEVERE each poet's lot; but sure most hard</l>
<l>Is the condition of the playhouse bard:</l>
<l>Doom'd to hear all that wou'd-be critics talk,</l>
<l>And in the go-cart of dull rules to walk!</l>
<l>"Yet authors multiply," you say. 'Tis true.</l>
<l>But what a numerous crop of critics too!</l>
<l>Scholars alone of old durst judge and write;</l>
<l>But now each journalist turns Stagyrite.</l>
<l>Quintilians in each coffee-house you meet,</l>
<l>And many a Longinus walks the street.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>In Shakespear's days, when his advent'rous muse,</l>
<l>A muse of fire! durst each bold licence use,</l>
<l>Her noble ardour met no critic's phlegm,</l>
<l>To check wild fancy, or her flights condemn:</l>
<l>Ariels and Calibans unblam'd she drew,</l>
<l>Or goblins, ghosts, and witches, brought to view.</l>
<l>If to historic truth she shap'd her verse,</l>
<l>A nation's annals freely she'd rehearse;</l>
<l>Bring Rome's or England's story on the stage,</l>
<l>And run, in three short hours, thro' half an age.</l>
<l>Our bard, all terror-struck, and fill'd with dread,</l>
<l>In Shakespear's awful footsteps dares not tread;</l>
<l>Thro' the wide field of hist'ry fears to stray,</l>
<l>And builds upon one narrow spot his play;</l>
<l>Steps not from realm to realm, whole feas between,</l>
<l>But barely changes twice or thrice his scene:</l>
<l>While Shakespear vaults on the poetic wire,</l>
<l>And pleas'd spectators fearfully admire,</l>
<l>Our bard, a critic pole between his hands,</l>
<l>On the tight-rope, scarce balanc'd, trembling stands;</l>
<l>Slowly and cautiously his way he makes,</l>
<l>And fears to fall at ev'ry step he takes:</l>
<l>While then fierce Warwick he before you brings,</l>
<l>That setter-up and puller-down of kings,</l>
<l>With British candour dissipate his sear!</l>
<l>An English story fits an English ear.</l>
<l>Tho' harsh and crude you deem his first essay,</l>
<l>A second may your favours well repay;</l>
<l>Applause may nerve his verse, and chear his heart,</l>
<l>And teach the practice of this dangerous art.</l>

<stage>MARGARET of ANJOU, Lady CLIFFORD.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>THANKS! gracious heav'n, my royal mistress smiles,</l>
<l>Unusual gladness sparkles in her eye,</l>
<l>And bids me welcome in the stranger joy</l>
<l>To his new mansion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Yes, My faithful Clifford,</l>
<l>Fortune is weary of oppressing me:</l>
<l>Through my dark cloud of grief, a chearful ray</l>
<l>Of light breaks forth, and gilds the whole horison.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>Henry in chains, and Edward on the throne</l>
<l>Of Lancaster, thyself a pris'ner here,</l>
<l>Thy captive son torn from his mother's arms,</l>
<l>And in the tyrant's pow'r, a kingdom lost:</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="6"/>
Amidst so many sorrows, what new hope</l>
<l>Hath wrought this wond'rous change?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>That which alone</l>
<l>In sorrow's bitt'rest hour, can minister</l>
<l>Sweet comfort to the daughters of affliction,</l>
<l>And bid misfortune smile, the hope of vengeance:</l>
<l>Vengeance, benignant patron of distress,</l>
<l>Thee I have oft invoked, propitious now</l>
<l>Thou smil'st upon me, if I do not grasp</l>
<l>The glorious opportunity, henceforth</l>
<l>Indignant frown, and leave me to my fate!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>Unhappy Princess! that deceiver hope</l>
<l>Hath often flatter'd, and as oft betray'd thee:</l>
<l>What hast thou gain'd by all its promises?</l>
<l>What's the reward of all thy toils?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Experience—</l>
<l>Yes, Clifford, I have read th' instructive volume</l>
<l>Of human nature, there long since have learn'd</l>
<l>The way to conquer men is by their passions;</l>
<l>Catch but the ruling foible of their hearts,</l>
<l>And all their boasted virtues shrink before you.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Edward and Warwick, those detested names,</l>
<l>Too well thou know'st, united to destroy me.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>That was indeed a fatal league.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>But mark me;</l>
<l>If we cou'd break this adamantine chain,</l>
<l>We might again be free: this mighty warrior,</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="7"/>
This dread of kings, th' unconquerable Warwick,</l>
<l>Is plighted to the fair Elizabeth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>The lady Gray, you mean, the beauteous widow,</l>
<l>Whose husband fell in arms for Lancaster.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>The same, my Clifford—Warwick long has lov'd—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>And means to wed her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>But if I have art,</l>
<l>Or she ambition, that shall never be.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>Can'st thou prevent it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Yes, my Clifford, Warwick</l>
<l>Were a mean choice for such transcendent beauty;</l>
<l>I shall provide her with a fitter husband,</l>
<l>A nobler far, and worthier of her charms,</l>
<l>Young Edward.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>Ha! the king! impossible!</l>
<l>Warwick, ev'n now, commission'd by the state,</l>
<l>To treat with Lewis, offers England's throne</l>
<l>To France's daughter, and e'er this, perhaps,</l>
<l>Hath sign'd the solemn contract.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Solemn trifles!</l>
<l>Mere cobweb ties—Love's a despotic tyrant,</l>
<l>And laughs, like other kings, at public faith,</l>
<l>When it opposes private happiness:</l>
<l>Edward is youthful, gay, and amorous;</l>
<l>His soul is ever open to the lure</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="8"/>
Of beauty, and Elizabeth hath charms</l>
<l>Might shake a hermit's virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>Hath he seen</l>
<l>This peerless fair one?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Yes,—by my contrivance,</l>
<l>When last he hunted in the forest, some,</l>
<l>Whom I had planted there, as if by chance</l>
<l>Alone directed, led him cross the lawn</l>
<l>To Grafton, there—ev'n as my soul had wish'd,</l>
<l>The dazzling lustre of her charms surpris'd</l>
<l>His unsuspecting heart—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>What follow'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>O!</l>
<l>He gaz'd and wonder'd; for a while his pride</l>
<l>Indignant rose, and struggled with his passion,</l>
<l>But love was soon victorious: and last night,</l>
<l>The earl of Suffolk, so my trusty spies</l>
<l>Inform me, was dispatch'd on wings of love,</l>
<l>To plead his master's cause, and offer her</l>
<l>The throne of England.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>What if she refuse</l>
<l>The golden bribe?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>No matter; all I wish</l>
<l>Is but to make them foes: the gen'rous Warwick</l>
<l>Is fiery, and impatient of reproof,</l>
<l>He will not brook a rival in his love</l>
<l>Though seated on a throne; besides, thou know'st,</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="9"/>
The haughty earl looks down with scorn on Edward,</l>
<l>As the mere work of his all-pow'rful hand,</l>
<l>The baby monarch of his own creation.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, madam, Edward still reveres</l>
<l>And loves him, still as conscious of the debt,</l>
<l>Pays him with trust and confidence; their souls</l>
<l>Are link'd together in the strictest bonds</l>
<l>Of sacred friendship.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>That but serves my cause:</l>
<l>Where ties are close, and interests united,</l>
<l>The slightest inj'ries are severely felt;</l>
<l>Offended friendship never can forgive.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>Now the full prospect opens to my view,</l>
<l>I see thy distant aim, and trace the paths</l>
<l>Of vengeance: England soon will be a scene</l>
<l>Of blood and horror, discord's fatal torch</l>
<l>Once lit up it in this devoted land,</l>
<l>What pow'r shall e'er extinguish it? alas!</l>
<l>I tremble at the consequence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>And I</l>
<l>Enjoy it:—O! 'twill be a noble contest</l>
<l>Of pride 'gainst pride, oppression 'gainst oppression;</l>
<l>Rise but the storm, and let the waves beat high,</l>
<l>The wreck may be our own: in the warm struggle,</l>
<l>Who knows but one or both of them may fall,</l>
<l>And Marg'ret rise triumphant on their ruin!</l>
<l>It must be so; and see the king approaches:</l>
<l>This way he passes from the council—mark</l>
<l>His down-cast eye, he is a stricken deer,</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="10"/>
The arrow's in his side—he cannot 'scape:</l>
<l>We'll meet and speak to him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>What mean you, madam?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>To ask him—what, I know, he will refuse;</l>
<l>That gives me fair pretext to break with him,</l>
<l>And join the man I hate, vindictive Warwick;</l>
<l>But soft, he comes—</l>

But that is past, great Warwick's arm prevail'd,</l>

<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Since the hour,</l>
<l>When fortune smil'd propitious on the cause</l>
<l>Of justice, and gave vict'ry to our arms;</l>
<l>You have been treated with all due respect,</l>
<l>All your condition, or your sex cou'd claim;</l>
<l>Serv'd like a queen, and lodg'd within our palace:</l>
<l>Is there ought more you can with reason ask,</l>

<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Give me back</l>

<l>You talk too proudly, madam; but to shew you</l>
<l>I cannot fear, you have your liberty.</l>
<l>Letters this morning I receiv'd from France,</l>
<l>Have offer'd noble ransom for your person;</l>
<l>Without that ransom—for the soul of Edward</l>

<l>Quick, tell me ev'ry circumstance, each word,</l>
<l>Each look, each gesture; didst thou mark them, Suffolk?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SUFFOLK.</speaker>
<l>I did, and will recount it all;—last night</l>
<l>By your command, in secret I repair'd</l>
<l>To Grafton's tufted bow'r, the happy seat</l>
<l>Of innocence and beauty, there I found</l>
<l>Thy soul's best hope, the fair Elizabeth,</l>
<l>Ne'er did these eyes behold such sweet perfection:</l>
<l>I found her busy'd in the pious office</l>

<l>That was a lucky moment, to prefer</l>

<l>You urg'd our royal purpose, then?</l>

<l>I did,</l>

<l>Was not that</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="14"/>
A kind propitious omen?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SUFFOLK.</speaker>
<l>Such indeed</l>
<l>Hoping to find it, I call'd in the pow'rs</l>
<l>Of flattery to my aid, and gaz'd upon her,</l>
<l>As if confounded by her dazling beauties—</l>
<l>Conscious she smil'd; but when, at length, I spake</l>
<l>Of England's monarch sighing at her feet—</l>
<l>The crimson glow of modesty o'erspread</l>
<l>Her cheek, and gave new lustre to her charms;</l>
<l>She turned aside, and as she silent bow'd</l>
<l>Her doubtful thanks, I mark'd the pearly tear</l>
<l>Steal down its secret track, and from her breast</l>
<l>Heard a deep sigh, she struggled to conceal;</l>
<l>If I have any judgment, or can trace</l>
<l>The hidden feelings of a woman's heart,</l>
<l>Her's is already fix'd: I fear, my liege,</l>
<l>With all that England, all that thou coud'st give,</l>
<l>The crown wou'd fit but heavy on her brow.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>

<l>Not heavier, Suffolk, than it sits on mine:</l>
<l>My throne is irksome to me; who wou'd wish</l>
<l>To be a sov'reign, when Elizabeth</l>
<l>Presers a subject?—Then th' impetuous Warwick,</l>
<l>His awful virtue will chastise my weakness.</l>
<l>I dread his censure, dread his keen reproaches,</l>
<l>And dread them more because they will be just.</l>

<l>I know him well—Believe me, Sir, the high</l>
<l>And haughty spirit, when it meets rebuke,</l>
<l>Is easiest check'd, and sinks into submission.</l>
<l>Let him, my liege, who ventures to arraign</l>
<l>His master's conduct, look into his own:</l>
<l>There ever is a corner in the heart</l>
<l>Open to folly; Warwick is not free</l>
<l>From human frailties.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>No: ambition fires</l>
<l>His noble breast, love triumphs over mine:</l>
<l>But well thou know'st, our eyes are ever open</l>
<l>To other's faults, and shut against our own.</l>

<l>England has long been rent by civil broils,</l>
<l>And fain wou'd rest her in the arms of peace:</l>
<l>Her wounds scarce clos'd, shall Edward open them,</l>

<l>O! Suffolk, did they know but half the cares</l>

<l>Their wretched master a few private hours</l>

<l>I am undone: and Warwick hath e'er this</l>

<l>Who knows but he may link me to a wretch;</l>

<l>I wou'd not cross my royal master's will;</l>

<l>It cannot last; we are by nature foes,</l>

<l>You've had, my lord, I fear,</l>

<l>A like distinguish'd, and a like successful.</l>

<l>What says our cousin France?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>By me, my liege,</l>
<l>He greets you well, and hopes in closer ties</l>

<l>The nurse of science, art's fair patroness,</l>
<l>And merit's best protector; but if France</l>
<l>Wou'd chain us down to ignominious terms,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Mistake me not, good Warwick, well I know</l>
<l>Thy spotless truth, thy honour, and thy love;</l>
<l>But glory has no further charms for me:</l>
<l>Rais'd by thy pow'rful aid to England's throne,</l>
<l>I ask no more:—already I am great</l>
<l>As fame and fortune with their smiles can make me,</l>
<l>And all I wish for now is—to be happy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>That too my liege, hath been thy Warwick's care;</l>
<l>Happy thou shalt be if the fairest form</l>
<l>That ever caught a gazing lover's eye,</l>
<l>Join'd to the sweetest most engaging virtues</l>
<l>Can make thee so:—Bona accepts with joy</l>
<l>Thy proffer'd hand: she is indeed a gem</l>
<l>Fit to adorn the brightest crown: to see</l>
<l>Is to admire her; trust me, England's self</l>
<l>The seat of beauty, and the throne of love,</l>
<l>Boasts not a fairer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Beauty, good my lord,</l>
<l>Is all ideal, 'tis the wayward child</l>
<l>Of fancy, shifting with the changeful wind</l>
<l>Of fond opinion; what to you appears</l>
<l><pb n="19" facs="23"/>
The model of perfection, may disgust</l>
<l>My strange capricious taste.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Such charms would fix</l>
<l>Inconstancy itself:—her winning virtues,</l>
<l>Ev'n if her beauty fail'd, would soon subdue</l>
<l>The rebel heart, and you wou'd learn to love her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Is passion to be learn'd then? woud'st thou make</l>
<l>A science of affection, guide the heart,</l>
<l>And teach it where to fix? impossible!</l>
<l>'Tis strange philosophy.</l>
<stage>(Rises and comes forward.)</stage>
<l>My lord, of Warwick,</l>
<l>Your zeal in England's, and in Edward's cause</l>
<l>Merits our thanks; but for th' intended marriage</l>
<l>With France's daughter—it may never be.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Not be! it must: your sacred word is pass'd,</l>
<l>And cannot be recall'd: but three days since</l>
<l>I sign'd the contract, and my honour's pledg'd</l>
<l>For the performance: heav'n's! whilst fickle France</l>
<l>Is branded 'midst the nations of the earth,</l>
<l>For breach of public faith, shall we, my liege,</l>
<l>Practise ourselves the vices we condemn,</l>
<l>Pass o'er a rival nation's ev'ry virtue,</l>
<l>And imitate their persidy alone?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>You'll pardon me, my lord, I thought it part</l>
<l>Of a king's pow'r to have a will, to see</l>
<l>With his own eyes, and in life's little feast,</l>
<l>To cater for himself; but 'tis, it seems,</l>
<l>A privilege his servants can refuse him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Kings, my lord, are born</l>

<l>Or of a weak and wav'ring boy?—henceforth,</l>
<l>Choose from the herd of fawning sycophants,</l>
<l>Some needy slave for your mock ambassys,</l>
<l>To do your work, and stain the name of England</l>
<l>With foul reproach—Edward, I blush for thee,</l>
<l>And for my country; from this hour, expect</l>
<l>From injur'd France contempt, with deep resentment</l>
<l>For broken faith, and enmity eternal.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Eternal be it then; for, as I prize</l>
<l>My inward peace, beyond the pomp of state,</l>
<l>And all the tinsel glare of fond ambition,</l>
<l>I will not wed her. Gracious heav'n! what am I?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The meanest peasant in my realm may chuse</l>
<l>His rustic bride, and share with her the sweets</l>
<l>Of mutual friendship and domestic bliss;</l>
<l>Why shou'd my happier subjects then deny me</l>
<l>The common rights, the privilege of nature,</l>
<l>And in a land of freedom thus conspire</l>

<l>Marg'ret, I thank thee—yes, it must be so:</l>
<l>His blushes, his confusion, all confirm it,</l>
<l>And yet I am amaz'd, astonish'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Wherefore?—</l>
<l><pb n="25" facs="29"/>
Is it so strange a youthful prince shou'd love?</l>
<l>Is it so strange, a mind, unfraught with wisdom,</l>
<l>And lifted high with proud prosperity,</l>
<l>Shou'd follow pleasure thro' the crooked paths</l>
<l>Of falshood, shou'd forsake a useless friend,</l>
<l>For the warm joys of animating beauty?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>No: but 'tis strange, that he who knows how much</l>
<l>He ow'd to Warwick, he, who ev'ry hour</l>
<l>Tastes the rich stream of bounty, should forget</l>
<l>The fountain whence it flow'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Alas! my lord,</l>
<l>Had you been chasten'd in affliction's school</l>
<l>As I have been, and taught by sad experience</l>
<l>To know mankind, you had not fall'n a prey</l>
<l>To such delusion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Was it like a friend,</l>
<l>Was it like Edward to conceal his love?</l>
<l>Some base insinuating, artful woman,</l>
<l>With borrow'd charms, perhaps.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Hold, hold, my lord,</l>
<l>Be not too rash: who fights in darkness oft</l>
<l>May wound a bosom friend: perhaps you wrong</l>
<l>The best, and most accomplish'd of her sex.</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Amazement! no: it must not, it cannot be:</l>
<l>Elizabeth! he cou'd not, dare not do it!</l>
<l>Confusion! I shall soon discover all.</l>
<stage>(aside.)</stage>
<l>But what have I to do with Edward's choice,</l>
<l>Whoe'er she be, if he refuses mine?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Dissimulation sits but ill, my lord,</l>
<l>On minds like yours: I am a poor weak woman,</l>
<l>And so, it seems, you think me; but suppose</l>
<l>That same all-knowing spirit which you rais'd,</l>
<l>Who condescends so kindly to instruct me,</l>
<l>Shou'd whisper—Warwick knows the pow'r of love</l>
<l>As well as Edward, that Elizabeth</l>
<l>Was his first wish, the idol of his soul;</l>
<l>What say you?—might I venture to believe it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Marg'ret, you might; for 'tis in vain to hide</l>
<l>A thought from thee; it might have told you too,</l>
<l>If it be so, there is not such a wretch</l>
<l>On earth as Warwick: give me but the proof—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Lord Suffolk was last night dispatch'd to Grafton,</l>
<l>To offer her a share in Edward's throne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Which she refus'd: did she not, Marg'ret? say</l>
<l>She did.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>I know not that, my lord, but crowns</l>
<l><pb n="27" facs="31"/>

<l>Such strong temptations, few of us, I fear,</l>

<l>Elizabeth</l>

<l>Edward is young and handsome.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Curses on him!</l>
<l>Think'st thou he knew my fond attachment there?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>O passing well, my lord, and when 'twas urg'd,</l>
<l>How deeply 'twou'd affect you, swore by heav'n,</l>
<l>Imperious Warwick ne'er shou'd be the master</l>
<l>Of charms like hers; 'twas happiness, he said,</l>
<l>Beyond a subject's merit to deserve,</l>
<l>Beyond his hope to wish for or aspire to.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>But for that Warwick, Edward's self had been</l>
<l>A subject still—and—may be so—hereafter.</l>
<l>Thou smil'st at my misfortunes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>I must smile</l>
<l>When I behold a subtle statesman thus</l>
<l>Duped and deluded by a shallow boy,</l>
<l>Sent on a fruitless errand to expose</l>
<l>His country and himself—it was indeed</l>
<l>A master stroke of policy, beyond</l>
<l>One shou'd have thought, the reach of years so green</l>
<l>As Edward's, to dispatch the weeping lover,</l>
<l>And seize the glorious opportunity</l>
<l>Of tamp'ring with his mistress here at home.</l>

<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Did Nevil, Rutland, Clifford, bleed for this?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>For this doth Henry languish in a dungeon,</l>
<l>And wretched Marg'ret live a life of woe:</l>
<l>For this you gave the crown to pious Edward,</l>
<l>And thus he thanks you for his kingdom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Crowns</l>
<l>Are baubles, fit for children like himself</l>
<l>To play with, I have scatter'd many of them:</l>

<l>Without or love or rev'rence be my portion!</l>
</lg>

<l>Henceforth, good Marg'ret, know me for thy friend,</l>
<l>We will have noble vengeance;—are there not</l>

<l>Some busy spirits who wish well to thee</l>
<l>And to thy cause?</l>

<l>There are: resentment sleeps,</l>

<l>Of loyalty, the slumb'ring ashes lye</l>
<l>Unheeded, Warwick's animating breath</l>
<l>Will quickly light them into flames again.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Then, Edward, from this moment I abjure thee:</l>

Be quick, good Marg'ret, haste e'er I repent,</l>

<stage>[to a gentleman.</stage>
<l>DISPATCH these letters strait; to Scotland—this</l>
<l>To the French envoy—these to th' earl of Pembroke.</l>
<stage>[turning to lady Clifford.</stage>
<l>Thus far, my friend, hath fortune favour'd us</l>
<l>Beyond our hopes: the soul of haughty Warwick</l>
<l>Is all on fire, and puling Edward loves</l>
<l>With most romantic ardour—O my Clifford,</l>
<l>You wou'd have smil'd to see how artfully</l>
<l>I play'd upon him: flatter'd, sooth'd, provok'd,</l>
<l>And wrought him to my purpose: we are link'd</l>
<l>In firmest bonds of amity and love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Hath Warwick then so soon forgot his Edward?</l>
<l>Think'st thou the frantic earl will e'er exert</l>

<l>The royal structure, which himself had rais'd?</l>
<l>Never.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>What is there disappointed love</l>
<l>And unrestrain'd ambition will not do?</l>
<l>I tell thee, we are sworn and cordial friends.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>Thou know'st he hates the house of Lancaster.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>No matter—he has marvellous good skill</l>
<l>In making kings, and I—have business for him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="35"/>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>And can'st thou then forget the cruel wrongs,</l>
<l>The deep-felt inj'ries of oppressive Warwick,</l>
<l>To join the hand that forg'd thy husband's chains</l>
<l>And rob'd thee of a crown?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>But what—my Clifford,</l>
<l>If the same hand that ravish'd shou'd restore it!</l>
<l>'Tis a court friendship and may last as long</l>
<l>As int'rest shall direct: I've not forgot,</l>
<l>No, nor forgiv'n; I hate, abhor, detest him,</l>
<l>But I will use him as my instrument;</l>
<l>My necessary tool, I'll make him draw</l>
<l>His trait'rous sword, to sheath it in the breast</l>
<l>Of him he loves, then point it to his own:</l>
<l>Yes, Clifford, I have twin'd me round his heart;</l>
<l>Like the fell serpent crept into his bosom,</l>
<l>That I might sting more surely: he shall perish;</l>
<l>I keep him for the last dear precious morsel,</l>
<l>To crown the glorious banquet of revenge.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>'Tis what he merits from us, yet th' attempt</l>
<l>Were dang'rous, he is still the people's idol,</l>

<l>And so perhaps shall Marg'ret be; applause</l>
<l>Waits on success; the fickle multitude,</l>
<l>Like the light straw that floats along the stream,</l>
<l>Glide with the current still and follow fortune.</l>
<l>Our prospect brightens every hour:—the people</l>
<l>Are ripe for a revolt: by civil wars,</l>
<l>Long time inur'd to savage scenes of plunder</l>
<l>And desolation, they delight in war:</l>
<l>These English heroes, when once flesh'd with slaughter,</l>

Like the keen mastiff, lose not soon the track</l>
<l>Of vengeance, nor forget the taste of blood.</l>

<l>What further succours have we to depend on,</l>
<l>Beside earl Warwick's?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>O his name alone</l>
<l>Will be an army to us.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLIFFORD.</speaker>
<l>If we have it:</l>
<l>Resentment is a short-liv'd passion—what</l>
<l>If Warwick should relent, and turn again</l>
<l>To Edward?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Then I have a bosom friend</l>
<l>That shall be ready to reward him for it;—</l>
<l>But I have better hopes: without his aid;</l>
<l>We are not friendless: Scotland's hardy sons</l>
<l>Who smile at danger, and defy the storm,</l>
<l>Will leave their barren mountains to defend</l>
<l>That liberty they love: add too the aid</l>
<l>Of gallant Pembroke, and the pow'rs which France</l>
<l>Will send to vindicate her injur'd honour:</l>
<l>E'er Edward can collect his force and take</l>
<l>The field, we shall be thirty thousand strong.</l>

<l>But what becomes of the young prince?</l>

<sp>

<l>I fear we've gone too far: th' indignant Warwick</l>

<l>With what an eye of scorn he turn'd him from us,</l>

<l>Some friends, perhaps,</l>
<l>Are better lost: you'll pardon me, my liege,</l>

<l>Wou'd soon convince you—Warwick is as weak—</l>

<l>As Edward thou woud'st say.</l>

<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Then by thee</l>

<l>Aye, what of him? quick, tell me, hast thou found</l>
<l>The happy traitor? give me but to know</l>
<l>That I may wreak my speedy vengeance on him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SUFFOLK.</speaker>
<l>Suppose that rival were the man whom most</l>
<l>You lov'd, the man, perhaps, whom most you fear'd;</l>
<l>Suppose 'twere—Warwick.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Ha! it cannot be:</l>
<l>I would not think it for a thousand worlds—</l>
<l>Warwick in love with her, impossible!</l>
<l>Now, Suffolk, do I fear thou speak'st from envy</l>
<l>And jealous hatred at the noble Warwick,</l>
<l>Not from the love of justice or of Edward;</l>
<l>Where didst thou learn this falshood?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SUFFOLK.</speaker>
<l>From the lips</l>
<l>Of truth, from one whose honour and whose word</l>
<l>You will not question; from—Elizabeth.</l>

<l>When last I saw her, for again I went</l>

<l>Was master of, I urg'd your ardent passion.</l>
<l>Told her how much, how tenderly you lov'd her,</l>
<l>And press'd with eagerness to know the cause</l>
<l>Of her unkind refusal, till at length</l>
<l>Reluctantly, with blushes she confess'd</l>
<l>There was a cause;—she thank'd you for your goodness,</l>
<l>'Twas more she said, much more than she deserv'd,</l>
<l><pb n="35" facs="39"/>
She ever shou'd revere her king: and if</l>
<l>She had a heart to give it shou'd be—Edward's.</l>

<l>So kind, and yet so cruel: well, go on.</l>

<l>Then told me all the story of her love,</l>
<l>That Warwick long had woo'd her—that her hand</l>
<l>Was promis'd; soon as he return'd from France,</l>
<l>Though once her father cruelly opposed it,</l>

<l>Are these his arts, is this the friend I lov'd?</l>
<l>By heav'n! she shall be mine; I will assert</l>
<l>A sov'reign's right, and tear her from him—what</l>
<l>If he rebel—another civil war!</l>

<l>This cumbrous garb of majesty that clings</l>
<l>So close around me, meet him man to man,</l>
<l>And try who best deserves her! but when kings</l>

My lord of Suffolk's leave—there was a time</l>

<l>There was a time perhaps,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Never; I've been a foolish faithful slave;</l>
<l>All my best years, the morning of my life,</l>
<l>Hath been devoted to your service: what</l>

<l>I thought, my lord, I had full well repay'd</l>
<l>Your services with honours, wealth, and pow'r</l>
<l>Unlimited: thy all-directing hand</l>
<l>Guided in secret ev'ry latent wheel</l>

<l>Who gave that cypher worth, and seated thee</l>

<l>And moulder'd in oblivion, had not Warwick</l>
<l>Dug from its sordid mine the useless ore,</l>
<l>And stamp'd it with a diadem. Thou know'st,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l>You may despise, perhaps, that useless aid</l>

<l>He who forgets a friend, deserves a foe.</l>

<l>These gusts of passion,</l>
<l>Will but inflame them; if I have been right</l>
<l>Inform'd, my lord, besides these dang'rous scars</l>
<l>Of bleeding honour, you have other wounds</l>
<l>As deep, tho' not so fatal: such perhaps</l>
<l>As none but fair Elizabeth can cure.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Elizabeth!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Nay, start not, I have cause</l>
<l>To wonder most: I little thought indeed</l>
<l>When Warwick told me I might learn to love,</l>
<l>He was himself so able to instruct me:</l>
<l>But I've discovered all.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>And so have I;</l>
<l>Too well I know thy breach of friendship there,</l>

<sp>
<pb n="39" facs="43"/>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>I scorn it, sir,—Elizabeth hath charms,</l>
<l>And I have equal right with you t'admire them:</l>
<l>Nor see I ought so godlike in the form,</l>
<l>So all-commanding in the name of Warwick,</l>
<l>That he alone shou'd revel in the charms</l>
<l>Of beauty, and monopolize perfection.</l>
<l>I knew not of your love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>By heav'n, 'tis false!</l>
<l>You knew it all, and meanly took occasion,</l>
<l>Whilst I was busy'd in the noble office,</l>
<l>Your grace thought fit to honour me withal.</l>
<l>To tamper with a weak unguarded woman,</l>
<l>To bribe her passions high, and basely steal</l>
<l>A treasure which your kingdom cou'd not purchase.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>How know you that? but be it as it may,</l>
<l>I had a right, nor will I tamely yield</l>
<l>My claim to happiness, the privilege,</l>
<l>To choose the partner of my throne and bed:</l>
<l>It is a branch of my prerogative.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Prerogative!—what's that? the boast of tyrants:</l>
<l>A borrow'd jewel, glitt'ring in the crown</l>
<l>With specious lustre, lent but to betray,</l>
<l>You had it, sir, and hold it—from the people.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>And therefore do I prize it; I wou'd guard</l>
<l>Their liberties, and they shall strengthen mine:</l>
<l>But when proud faction and her rebel crew</l>
<l>Insult their sov'reign, trample on his laws,</l>
<l>And bid defiance to his pow'r, the people</l>
<l><pb n="40" facs="44"/>
In justice to themselves, will then defend</l>
<l>His cause, and vindicate the rights they gave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Go to your darling people then; for soon,</l>
<l>If I mistake not, 'twill be needful; try</l>
<l>Their boasted zeal, and see if one of them</l>
<l>Will dare to lift his arm up in your cause,</l>
<l>If I forbid them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Is it so, my lord,</l>
<l>Then mark my words: I've been your slave too long,</l>
<l>And you have rul'd me with a rod of iron,</l>
<l>But henceforth know, proud peer, I am thy master,</l>
<l>And will be so: the king, who delegates</l>

<l>My friend!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>My Pembroke, welcome:</l>
<l>Thee I have ever found most just and kind;</l>
<l>But, in the darkness of adversity</l>
<l>The jewel friendship shines with double lustre.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>I am not of the infect train that bask</l>
<l>In fortune's sunshine, and when ev'ning damps</l>
<l>Arise, are seen no more: no, Warwick, what</l>
<l>I speak, I mean: you have been hardly treated.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>O! Pembroke, didst thou know but half the wrongs</l>
<l>That I have suffer'd, thou wou'dst pity me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>I wou'd do more, much more, my Warwick: he</l>
<l>Who only pities but insults the wretched;</l>
<l>I come with nobler views, I come to tell thee,</l>
<l>That I have felt thy inj'ries as my own,</l>
<l>And will revenge them too.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>How kind thou art</l>
<l>To feel for Warwick!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>Ev'ry honest breast</l>
<l>Must feel the inj'ries that a good man suffers:</l>
<l>Thine is the common cause of all: adieu</l>
<l>To English freedom, when our liberty</l>
<l><pb n="45" facs="49"/>
Shall be dependent on a sov'reign's nod,</l>
<l>When years of honest service shall be paid</l>
<l>With infamy and chains.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>I've not deserv'd them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>Nor shalt thou wear them long: for thou hast great</l>
<l>And pow'rful friends—the noble duke of Clarence.</l>
<l>Behold his signet—this, my Warwick, gain'd me</l>
<l>Admission here—we must be secret.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Then I am not forsaken: Clarence!—Ha!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>Yes:</l>
<l>The gallant youth, with honest zeal, declar'd</l>
<l>He lov'd his brother much, but justice more.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Then, Edward, I defy thee: gen'rous Clarence!</l>
<l>Thou know'st, the man who thus cou'd treat a friend,</l>
<l>Wou'd soon forget a brother—but say, Pembroke,</l>
<l>How stands the duke of Buckingham?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>Fast bound</l>
<l>To Edward; he and that smooth courtier Suffolk</l>
<l>Are the two rotten pillars that support</l>
<l>His tott'ring throne: but Marg'ret—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Aye: how fares</l>
<l>My new ally? has she escaped the tyrant?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>She has: and by some wond'rous means contriv'd</l>
<l>To free her captive son.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="46" facs="50"/>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Tho' I abhor,</l>
<l>I must admire that enterprising woman:</l>
<l>Her active mind is ever on the wing</l>
<l>In search of fresh expedients, to recover</l>
<l>The crown she lost.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>Already she has rais'd</l>
<l>A pow'rful army; all the secret foes</l>
<l>Of York's ambitious line rush forth in crowds,</l>
<l>And join her standard: e'er to-morrow's sun</l>
<l>Shall dawn upon us, she will set thee free.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>O! Pembroke, nothing wounds the gen'rous mind</l>
<l>So deep as obligations to a foe.</l>
<l>Is there no way to liberty, my friend,</l>
<l>But through the bloody paths of civil war?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>I fear there is not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Then it must be so:</l>
<l>I cou'd have wish'd—but freedom and revenge</l>
<l>On any terms are welcome.</l>

<l>Our hearts.</l>
</sp>

<l>Now, Warwick, be thou firm</l>
<l>In thy resolves; let no unmanly fears,</l>
<l>No foolish fond remembrance of past friendship</l>
<l>Unnerve thy arm, or shake thy steady purpose.</l>
</sp>

<pb n="47" facs="51"/>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>No: by my wrongs it shall not: once, thou know'st,</l>
<l>I lov'd him but too well, and these vile chains</l>
<l>Are my reward,—O give me but the use</l>
<l>Of this once pow'rful arm, and thou shalt see</l>
<l>How it shall punish falshood.—are thy forces</l>
<l>Prepar'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>They are, and wait but for my orders;</l>
<l>Clarence will join us soon: our first great end</l>
<l>Is to secure thy liberty; that done,</l>
<l>We haste to seize the palace and redeem</l>

<lg>
<l>A moment's patience, and I'll tell thee all.</l>
<l>Marg'ret, thou know'st, had rais'd a pow'rful force,</l>
<l>That doubled Edward's troops: elate with pride,</l>
<l>And almost sure of victory, she urg'd</l>
<l>The tardy spearmen; on they rush'd, as if</l>
<l>Secure of conquest: the unhappy king</l>
<l>Stood nobly firm, and seem'd to brave his fate,</l>
<l>When Warwick like a guardian god appear'd:</l>
<l>His noble mien and all-commanding look</l>
<l>Struck deep attention; ev'ry eye was bent</l>
<l>Upon him, and an awful silence reign'd</l>
<l>O'er either host, he rais'd his voice on high,</l>
<l>And stop, he cry'd, your sacrilegious hands,</l>
<l>Nor touch my friend: who pierces Edward's breast,</l>
<l>Must pass through mine: I rais'd him to the throne,</l>
<l>And will support him there: to you I gave,</l>
<l>From you my fellow-soldiers I expect him:</l>
<l>Howe'er his cruel wrongs have wounded me,</l>
<l>He never injur'd you, and, I—forgive him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>He spake, and instant thro' the gazing croud</l>
<l>A murmur ran; down dropp'd their nerveless arms,</l>
<l>As if enchanted by some magic pow'r,</l>
<l>And with one voice they cry'd, long live king Edward!</l>

On like a modest virgin wishing came,</l>

<l>They ran with speechless joy: the tender scene</l>
<l>Affected ev'ry heart, and the rough soldier,</l>
<l>Unused to melting sympathy, forgot</l>

<l>A ponyard forth, and plung'd it in his heart.</l>

<l>If it be true,</l>
<l>As much I fear it is, a thousand deaths</l>

<l>Thou shalt be tortur'd.</l>

<l>Tyrant, I defy thee;</l>
<l>Thy threats appall not me: prepare your tortures,</l>

All that ingenious malice can suggest,</l>

<l>They cannot be so great as those you feel.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Guards, take the monster hence, let her be chain'd</l>
<l>In some deep dungeon, dark as her own thoughts,</l>

<l>My Warwick! my preserver!—she shall bleed</l>
<l>For this in ev'ry vein.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Think not of her,</l>
<l>She has no pow'r to hurt thee; and with guilt</l>
<l>Like hers, 'tis punishment enough to live:</l>
<l>This is no time for vengeance; death comes on</l>
<l>With hasty strides, 'tis but a little while,</l>
<l>A few short moments, and we part for ever.</l>
<l>My friend—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>I am not worthy of the name,</l>
<l>For I disgrac'd, dishonour'd, murther'd thee;</l>
<l>Edward's unkindness was the cause of all:</l>
<l>Can'st thou forgive me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>O! may Warwick's crimes</l>
<l><pb n="68" facs="72"/>
Ne'er meet forgiveness from offended heav'n,</l>
<l>If from my soul, I do not pardon, love,</l>

</sp>

<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Away, let me support him;</l>
<l>'Tis the last office I shall e'er perform</l>
<l>For thee, my Warwick—wilt thou lean upon me</l>
<l>And seal my pardon with one kind embrace?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>We never hated.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>But my love was blind.</l>

<l>I forgot</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Shock'd at the news</l>
<l>Of thy untimely fate, she sunk beneath it,</l>

<l>O! give me way,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>O!</l>
<l>This is too much, the bitterness of death</l>

<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Why wou'd you bring her here!</l>
<stage>(to the attendants.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Elizabeth,</l>
<l>Be comforted.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZABETH.</speaker>
<l>O no, it is my doom</l>
<l>Never to taste of joy or comfort more:</l>
<l>No; from this hateful world will I retire,</l>
<l>And mourn my Warwick's fate, imploring heav'n</l>
<l>That I may soon wear out my little store</l>
<l>Of hopeless days, and join thee in the tomb.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>That must not be: I've done my friend a wrong,</l>

<l>Thy hand, Elizabeth, if e'er thou lov'st,</l>
<l>Observe me now—thine, Edward—for my sake</l>

O! I will guard her with a parent's care,</l>

<l>The rising sigh, wipe off the flowing tear,</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>Wilt thou indeed? then I shall die in peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZABETH.</speaker>

<sp>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<l>Impossible:—I feel</l>
<l>The hand of death press cold upon my heart,</l>
<l>And all will soon be o'er:—I've liv'd to save</l>
<l>My falling country, to repent my crimes,</l>
<l>Redeem my honour, and restore my king.</l>

<l>O Edward, if thou hop'st that length of days,</l>

<l>Discourage faction, banish flatt'rers, keep</l>

<head>EPILOGUE,</head>
<byline>Written by DAVID GARRICK, <abbr>Esq</abbr> Spoken by Mrs. YATES.</byline>
<l>EXHAUSTED quite with prisons, racks, and death,</l>
<l>Permit me here to take a little breath!</l>
<l>You who have seen my actions, known their springs,</l>
<l>Say, are we women such <hi>insipid</hi> things?</l>
<l>Say, lords of the creation, mighty men!</l>
<l>In <hi>what</hi> have you surpass'd us, <hi>where?</hi> and <hi>when?</hi></l>
<l>I come to know to <hi>whom</hi> the palm is due,</l>
<l>To us weak vessels, or to stronger you?</l>
<l>Against your conqu'ring swords, I draw—my fan,</l>
<l>Come on!—now parry Marg'ret, if you can.</l>
<stage>(Sets herself in a posture of defence.</stage>
<l>Stand up, ye boasters! <stage>(to the pit)</stage> don't there sneaking sit;</l>
<l>Are you for <hi>Pleasure, Politics,</hi> or <hi>Wit?</hi></l>
<l>The boxes smile to see me scold the pit.</l>
<l><hi>Their</hi> turn is next—and tho' I will not wrong 'em,</l>
<l>A woeful havock there will be among 'em.—</l>
<l>You our best friends, <stage>(to the pit)</stage> love, cherish, and respect us;</l>
<l>Not take our fortunes, marry, and neglect us.</l>
<l>You think indeed, that as you please, you rule us,</l>
<l>And with a strange importance often school us!</l>
<l>Yet, let each citizen describe a brother,</l>
<l>I'll tell you what you say of one another.</l>
<l><hi>My neighbour leads, poor foul, a woeful life,</hi></l>
<l><hi>A worthy man—but govern'd by his wife!</hi></l>
<l>How, say you? what, all silent?—then, 'tis true:</l>
<l>We rule the city—Now, great Sirs; to you. <stage>(to the boxes.)</stage></l>
<l>What is your boast?—Wou'd you, like me, have done,</l>
<l>To free a captive wife, or fare a son?</l>
<l>Rather than run such dangers of your lives,</l>
<l>You'd leave your children, and lock up your wives.</l>
<l>When with your noblest deeds, a nation rings!</l>
<l>You are but puppets, and we play the strings.</l>
<l>We plan no battles—true—but out of fight,</l>
<l>Crack goes the fan,—and armies halt or fight!</l>
<l>You have th' advantage, Ladies—wisely reap it,</l>
<l>And let me hint the only way to keep it.</l>
<l>Let men of vain ideas, have their fill,</l>
<l>Frown, bounce, stride, strut,—while you, with happy skill,</l>
<l>Like anglers, use the finest silken thread;</l>
<l>Give line enough—nor check the tugging head:</l>
<l>The fish <hi>will</hi> flounder—you with gentle hand,</l>
<l>And soft degrees, must bring the <hi>trout</hi> to land;</l>
<l>A more specific nostrum cannot be—</l>
<l><hi>Probatum est</hi>—and never falls with <hi>Me.</hi></l>
