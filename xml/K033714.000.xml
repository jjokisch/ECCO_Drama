<head>PROLOGUE;</head>
<byline>Written by EDMOND MALONE, Esq.</byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. KEMBLE.</byline>
<sp>
<l>FROM Thespis' days to this enlighten'd hour,</l>
<l>The stage has shewn the dire abuse of power;</l>
<l>What mighty mischief from ambition springs;</l>
<l>The fate of heroes, and the fall of kings.</l>
<l>But these high themes, howe'er adorn'd by art,</l>
<l>Have seldom gain'd the passes of the heart:</l>
<l>Calm we behold the pompous mimick woe,</l>
<l>Unmov'd by sorrows we can never know.</l>
<l>Far other feelings in the soul arise,</l>
<l>When private griefs arrest our ears and eyes;</l>
<l>When the false friend, and blameless, suffering wife,</l>
<l>Reflect the image of domestick life:</l>
<l>And still more wide the sympathy, more keen,</l>
<l>When to each breast responsive is the scene;</l>
<l>And the sine cords that <hi>every</hi> heart intwine,</l>
<l>Dilated, vibrate with the glowing line.—</l>
<l>Such is the theme, that now demands your ear,</l>
<l>And claims the silent plaudit of a tear.</l>
<l>One tyrant passion all mankind must prove;</l>
<l>The balm or poison of our lives—is <hi>love.</hi></l>
<l>Love's sovereign sway extends o'er every clime,</l>
<l>Nor owns a limit or of space or time.</l>
<l>For love, the generous fair one hath sustain'd</l>
<l>More poignant ilis than ever poet feign'd.</l>
<l>For love, the maid partakes her lover's tomb,</l>
<l>Or pines long life out in sad foothless gloom.</l>
<l><pb facs="6"/>Ne'er shall Oblivion shroud the Grecian wife<note n="*" place="foot">—Spectant subeuntem fata mariti, <bibl><hi>Alcenstem. JUV.</hi></bibl></note>,</l>
<l>Who gave her own, to save a husband's life.</l>
<l>With her contending, see our Edward's bride,</l>
<l>Imbibing poison from his mangled side.</l>
<l>Nor less, though proud of intellectual sway,</l>
<l>Does haughty man the tyrant power obey:</l>
<l>From youth to age by love's wild tempest tost,</l>
<l>For love, even mighty kingdoms has he lost.</l>
<l>Vain—wealth, and fame, and Fortune's fost'ring care<note n="†" place="foot"><l>Thou art slave, whom Fortune's tender arm</l><l>With favour never clasp'd.</l><bibl><hi>Timon of Athens.</hi></bibl></note>,</l>
<l>If no fond breast the splendid blessings share;</l>
<l>And, each day's bustling pageantry once past,</l>
<l><hi>There, only</hi> there, his bliss is found at last.</l>
<l>For woes fictitious oft your tears have flow'd;</l>
<l>Your cheek for wrongs imaginary glow'd.</l>
<l>To-night our poet means not to assail</l>
<l>Your throbbing bosoms with a fancy'd tale.</l>
<l>Scarce sixty suns their annual course have roll'd,</l>
<l>Since all was real that our scenes unfold.</l>
<l>To touch your breasts with no unpleasing pain,</l>
<l>The Muse's magick bids it live again:</l>
<l>Bids mingled character, as once in life,</l>
<l>Resume their functions, and renew their strife;</l>
<l>While pride, revenge, and jealousy's wild rage,</l>
<l>Rouse all the genius of the impassion'd stage.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>LOOK up, sir; you are safe. The tempest's wildness</l>
<l>Seems hush'd on shore. Where was your vessel bound?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANOA.</speaker>
<l>Ancona was her port; the hurricane</l>
<l>Baffled our pilot's skill, and drove us headlong</l>
<l>(Just as your ship made good her anchorage,)</l>
<l>On the sharp rock, where you beheld her split.</l>
<l>All my companions, fifty luckless men,</l>
<l>Sunk in my sight; and I had shar'd their fate,</l>
<l>Had not your strong arm sav'd me. But, alas,</l>
<l>We are in Genoa, if mine eyes deceive not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>The same.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="9"/>
<speaker>MANOA.</speaker>
<l>Too well I know it. Shield me Heaven!</l>
<l>For what am I reserv'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>I hope, to lose</l>
<l>The memory of your grief, and find peace here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANOA.</speaker>
<l>O no! to lose my life, if I'm found here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Pray, let me know your story. By your habit</l>
<l>I guess you are not of our faith or nation.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANOA.</speaker>
<l>I am by birth of Syria; but here sojourn'd</l>
<l>Twice twenty years in wealth and fair repute,</l>
<l>Till Christian malice, or my nation's curse,</l>
<l>Or both combining, turn'd me forth a wanderer.</l>
<l>Look there, that very mansion once was mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>I now recall some traces of that face:</l>
<l>Your name is Manoa?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANOA.</speaker>
<l>Ay, that wretch am I.</l>
<l>Thou hast an aspect to benign and noble,</l>
<l>Thou could'st not injure me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS,</speaker>
<l>Myself much sooner.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANOA.</speaker>
<l>This state, for its late levies 'gainst the Turk,</l>
<l>Call'd on all traffickers for sums of gold;</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="10"/>Our tribe, at my persuasion, furnish'd them,</l>
<l>On rates so easy to the borrowers,</l>
<l>The native merchants' offers were refus'd,</l>
<l>And publick clamour, and disgrace, pursued them:</l>
<l>Thence grew their hate. Of black and monstrous crimes,</l>
<l>Avouch'd on oath by witnesses suborn'd,</l>
<l>They charg'd me guiltless: flight alone was left,</l>
<l>To save my hunted life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>And I remember,</l>
<l>'Twas rumour'd you had perish'd by the sea,</l>
<l>Attempting your escape; and so believ'd:</l>
<l>Knaves call'd your fate a judgment.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANOA.</speaker>
<l>To prevent</l>
<l>A hot pursuit, the Hebrews here in Genoa</l>
<l>By common concert spread abroad that rumour.</l>
<l>The death they feign'd, this morning, but for thee,</l>
<l>My brave preserver, had indeed o'erta'en me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>I can do more to serve you. Name your wish.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANOA.</speaker>
<l>At present, this. Not far from hence resides</l>
<l>The lord Durazzo, whose great wealth and power,</l>
<l>As heaven sends dews and sunshine, are dispens'd</l>
<l>To gladden every humble thing beneath them.</l>
<l>Let your men help me there, for I am feeble;</l>
<l>And this disguise may save me from the note</l>
<l>Of those who pass,—though in this slothful city</l>
<l>Few leave their down so early.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Sir, farewel!</l>
<l>You shall hear more of me.</l>

<head>SCENE II.</head>
<stage>CAMILLO, MARCELLUS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>A gentle invitation. Ha! Marcellus!</l>
<l>Welcome once more to Genoa, my dear cousin, <stage>embracing.</stage></l>
<l>We heard you had escap'd with some slight hurts</l>
<l>That bloody lingering business there at Candia;</l>
<l>But such fierce storms of late have swept our coasts,</l>
<l>Our fears were, lest the angry elements,</l>
<l>Leaguing alike against the Christian cross,</l>
<l>Might prove worse foes even than the infidels.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>We had rough weather, but our sturdy bark</l>
<l>Out-rode it. Is my mother well? At leisure</l>
<l>I shall fatigue your ear with other questions</l>
<l>My ignorance and your kindness must excuse.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="12"/>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>You have not seen her then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>No. I arriv'd</l>
<l>Within this hour; and knowing how she lov'd,</l>
<l>Lov'd even to dotage, my poor brother Claudio,</l>
<l>(Lost by a fate so strange and horrible,)</l>
<l>I would not rush at once into her presence,</l>
<l>Till some kind friend, like you, should first inform me,</l>
<l>How best to assuage her grief, and hide my own.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>Thought like a son. But O, his vanish'd form,</l>
<l>Again presented in your living likeness,</l>
<l>Will with the strong extreme convulse her soul,</l>
<l>And joy so mix'd with anguish doubly shake her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>'Twas what I fear'd, Camillo. I must try then</l>
<l>To fix her fond attention on myself,</l>
<l>And shun that direful theme.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>Direful indeed!</l>
<l>(How my heart shrinks even now think of it!)</l>
<l>'Tis ever present to her tortur'd fancy:</l>
<l>And we who daily see her, have observ'd,</l>
<l>Our care to give the current of her thoughts</l>
<l>A different course, but swells up her impatience.</l>
<l>You know the lady Fulvia's ardent temper,</l>
<l>How sudden, yet how strong in every feeling.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Our burning mountains, when their fires burst forth,</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="13"/>Rage not more fiercely than her breast inflam'd.</l>
<l>But is it possible, in all this time,</l>
<l>Months after months elaps'd, no light, no spark,</l>
<l>To guide to a discovery has been trac'd?</l>
<l>The Turkish gallies so o'erspread the sea,</l>
<l>My letters rarely reach'd me while at Candia.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>What have you heard?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>But thus much, and no more:</l>
<l>Two days ere that for his intended marriage</l>
<l>With good Durazzo's daughter, lovely Julia,</l>
<l>Was Claudio missing; two days more were pass'd</l>
<l>In fruitless search, and sad anxiety:</l>
<l>When on the fifth, some weary mariners,</l>
<l>Flying for shelter from a furious storm,</l>
<l>Midst the white caverns on the western shore,</l>
<l>A mile from Genoa, found his lifeless body:</l>
<l>In his clench'd hand was his own blood-stain'd sword,</l>
<l>And in his manly breast a mortal wound.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>And there ends all our knowledge. Proclamation</l>
<l>Of vast rewards to find his murderer,</l>
<l>Is still abroad through all the Italian states.</l>
<l>The untouch'd jewels of his costly habit,</l>
<l>Bright and conspicuous, clearly manifest</l>
<l>'Twas not the crime of men who kill for spoil.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Alas, Camillo, well I know the place;</l>
<l>When we were boys it was our favourite haunt.</l>
<l>He could not sure have fall'n by his own sword?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="14"/>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>Impossible: A thought so black and sullen</l>
<l>Ne'er dim'd the sunshine of his chearful breast.</l>
<l>The joy he long had sigh'd for in his reach,</l>
<l>Possess'd of all that gilds the morn of life,</l>
<l>And each fair prospect bright'ning to his hopes;</l>
<l>Besides, the exalted tenour of his mind,</l>
<l>Too firm and full for wild extremities;</l>
<l>They crush that black conclusion: nay, the skilful,</l>
<l>Who search'd the wound with closest art and care,</l>
<l>Pronounc'd it, not the execrable work</l>
<l>Of his own sword, but some assassin's steel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>May wakeful conscience, like a writhing snake,</l>
<l>If still he lives, curl round the villain's heart,</l>
<l>With sharpest venom to consume and gnaw him!</l>
<l>I know our base, Italian, stabbing spirit;</l>
<l>In the close art of murder none excell us.</l>
<l>We read the very earth, breathe the same air,</l>
<l>With our old Latian fires; but, for their virtues,</l>
<l>As well might eagles rustle their large plumes</l>
<l>Where owlets roost, or filthy kites engender.</l>
<l>As they find shelter in our dastard breasts.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>Let others rail; but thine's a nobler task;</l>
<l>To shame desen'racy by fair example:</l>
<l>For twenty forward spirits, like thine own,</l>
<l>Might shake this state from its inglorious trance.</l>
<l>And rouse our sloth to gallant enterprise.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>I left it a luxurious, worthless city,</l>
<l>Proud of its trash, its wealth, if such I find it,</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="15"/>I will not strike my lazy root at home,</l>
<l>To rot in rank contagious apathy,</l>
<l>But seek again a scene of vigorous action.</l>
<l>The unskilful perseverance of the Turk</l>
<l>Still wakes excitement for a soldier's ardour.—</l>
<l>But who are those to earnest in discourse?</l>
<l>This way they move.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>Durazzo is the eldest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Fair Julia's father; him I know. The other?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>Mentevole his name, a noble youth,</l>
<l>And suitor (hopelessly, I think,) to Julia,</l>
<l>Though vulgar fame calls him a favour'd wooer.</l>
<l>But this report, startling your mother's ear,</l>
<l>(Who brooks no slight to her son's memory,)</l>
<l>Has much estrang'd her from Durazzo's house:</l>
<l>And thus, the bonds of their long amity</l>
<l>The lie with many mouths has puff'd asunder.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>My care all be to reunite their friendship.</l>
<l>But how must I esteem Mentevole?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>As one accomplish'd, brave, and liberal.</l>
<l>Soon after your departure for the siege,</l>
<l>He came from travel home, and was to Claudio</l>
<l>A second self.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>So shall he be to me;</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="16"/>I'll wear him here. But go thou to my mother,</l>

<l>O welcome, to thy country! thy smooth cheek</l>

<l>But for these well-known kindred lineaments,</l>

<head>SCENE IV.</head>
<stage>DURAZZO, MENTEVOLE.</stage>
<sp>
<l>Is he not like to Claudie?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Rather say,</l>
<l>Is't not himself, as ere the tomb receiv'd him?</l>
<l>But dear my lord, by all that charm'd your youth,</l>
<l>Forgive me, though I seem importunate:</l>
<l>O, win your daughter to accept my vows;</l>
<l>For I have lov'd to such a mad excess,</l>
<l>So stor'd up every thought of happiness</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="18"/>In that fond hope, should I prove bankrupt there,</l>
<l>I dare not look to earth or Heaven for comfort.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Mentevole, I doubt not of your love;</l>
<l>My daughter too believes it; a feign'd passion</l>
<l>Speaks not your fervent language:—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>A feign'd passion!</l>
<l>Thus hear me swear—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Oaths are unnecessary.</l>
<l>My tongue has not been niggard of your praise;</l>
<l>I've tried entreaties too. A harsh command,</l>
<l>Heard with repugnancy, that she should love,</l>
<l>Because her anxious father deems it meet,</l>
<l>Or you would have it so, might change at once</l>
<l>The indifference you complain of to aversion.</l>
<l>Thus the calm lake that slept at peace before,</l>
<l>Turns a strong tide, and sets against your wishes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>O, the degrees, my lord, are infinite,</l>
<l>Between a harsh command, and such persuasion</l>
<l>As every day the fondest parents use,</l>
<l>In tender strife with a coy maid's reluctance.</l>
<l>Were I to plead as a feed advocate,</l>
<l>Even for a scanty rood of barren earth,</l>
<l>I should account me faithless to my charge,</l>
<l>My rhetorick o'erpriz'd at one poor ducat,</l>
<l>Did I neglect a gloss, or argument,</l>
<l>Might sway the unwilling judge to my decision.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="19"/>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Instruct me to speed better. I shall thank you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>My words, my action, should have life and grace;</l>
<l>I'd probe his reason, try his every humour,</l>
<l>Wind to his inmost soul, grow to his eye,</l>
<l>Watch where impression stole upon his sense;</l>
<l>There ply my strength, where most I found him weak,</l>
<l>Nor cease to urge till I had conquer'd him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Passion thus blindfold sees no obstacle.</l>
<l>Young man, young man, be calm a while, and hear me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Yet tell me not, my suit is desperate;</l>
<l>Sooth, though you cannot heal; and I will listen,</l>
<l>As if I liv'd by every sound you utter'd,</l>
<l>And death and inattention were the same.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>You knew long since, to see my daughter wedded,</l>
<l>Without a variance 'twixt her choice and mine,</l>
<l>Was my prime wish. Malignant destiny</l>
<l>Marr'd that fair prospect. The assassin's stab</l>
<l>Had almost pierc'd with one pernicious stroke</l>
<l>Two faithful breasts. Anguish unutterable</l>
<l>On her soft frame lay'd such a deadly grasp,</l>
<l>Too long I trembled for her life and reason.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Spare me, my lord, O spare me the remembrance;</l>
<l>It harrows me too deeply.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="20"/>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Can you question,</l>
<l>I wish to see her unavailing sorrow</l>
<l>Chang'd to gay festivals, and bridal joy?</l>
<l>Or think you, that supinely I can view</l>
<l>(Thus childless, but in her,) my house's honours,</l>
<l>My large estates, sunk in a virgin's tomb,</l>
<l>Or scatter'd 'mongst remote and thankless kindred;</l>
<l>When, by alliance with your well-match'd love,</l>
<l>Such near and natural heirs may spring to bless me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Why, grant it all, yet how have I prevail'd?</l>
<l>My presence she endures, for you desir'd it;</l>
<l>Yet, if the only theme can touch me nearly,</l>
<l>But trembles from my tongue, her cheek turns pale;</l>
<l>Her blood runs back, as mustering to her heart,</l>
<l>To fortify the access more strong against me.</l>
<l>I pity him, who thinks he has known distress,</l>
<l>And never felt the pang of hopeless love:</l>
<l>The consummation of all other ills</l>
<l>Is light and trivial to that misery.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Time may do much, nor shall my aid be wanting.</l>
<l>Urge me no more, nor doubt me. Your kind sister,</l>
<l>Olympia, the companion she holds dear,</l>
<l>May unobserv'd watch every soft approach,</l>
<l>And steal a lover's image on her fancy.</l>
<l>But lo, she comes. Farewel! I go to serve you.</l>

<stage><hi>To him</hi> OLYMPIA.</stage>
<sp>
<l>Tell me, Olympia, are not women woo'd</l>
<l>By constancy, and deep-protested oaths?</l>
<l>By living on their smiles, by nice attentions?</l>
<l>By yielding up our reason to their humours?</l>
<l>By adoration of their beauty's power?</l>
<l>By sighs, and tears, by flattery, kneeling, fawning?</l>
<l>Tell me how many ways a manly mind</l>
<l>Must be debas'd, to win a lady's smile?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLYMPIA.</speaker>
<l>That which by baseness only can be gain'd,</l>
<l>Were better undesir'd. But say, good brother,</l>
<l>Why do you question with such angry haste,</l>
<l>And what strange fury ruffles all your mien?</l>
<l>Give me your hand: it burns. You are not well.</l>
<l>Your mind unquiet fevers thus your blood.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>No, no: a woman's coldness. Your fair friend,—</l>
<l>Teach her to smile, and my distemper dies.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLYMPIA.</speaker>
<l>She has no sense of joy: that beauteous flower</l>
<l>Bows its sweet head o'er Claudio's bloody grave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="22"/>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Must that eternal sound grate on me still!</l>
<l>Hast thou been faithful to me? Hast thou told her,</l>
<l>How thou hast seen these lids, even at her name.</l>
<l>Swell with unbidden tides or melting fondness?</l>
<l>Whole nights how I have fill'd thy patient ear,</l>
<l>And she my only theme? How many times,</l>
<l>When chance has given her beauties to my sight,</l>
<l>Thou hast beheld me, trembling, try to speak,</l>
<l>And gaze away my meaning?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLYMPIA.</speaker>
<l>Nay, my lord,</l>
<l>Endeavours true as mine disdain suspicion:</l>
<l>And let me say, if she should ne'er consent,—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>How's that? take heed! if she shou'd ne'er consent?</l>
<l>Put not my life on chilling supposition;</l>
<l>Make it the doubt, Olympia, of a moment,</l>
<l>And though thou art my sister, and a dear one.</l>
<l>By heaven, I almost think that I shall hate thee:</l>
<l>For here I swear, deeply and calmly swear it,</l>
<l>The hour which sees me desperate of her love,</l>
<l>Shall be my last.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLYMPIA.</speaker>
<l>For shame! be more a man.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>By the great power which gave me sense and being,</l>
<l>I'll wrest from fate my folly's chastisement,</l>
<l>And this right hand shall end me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLYMPIA.</speaker>
<l>Oh! how shocking,</l>
<l>To hear with what devout impiety,</l>
<l><pb n="16" facs="23"/>Thou dar'st call heaven the witness of an oath,</l>
<l>Outrageous to its own bless'd providence!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Well, be it as it may, I have sworn it.</l>
<l>Knows she that young Marcellus is arriv'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLYMPIA.</speaker>
<l>Yes; and the pleasing tidings for a moment</l>
<l>Dispell'd the cloud that dim'd her beauteous eyes.</l>
<l>Instant she beg'd me, and with warmth unusual,</l>
<l>To bear her greetings to his mother Fulvia;</l>
<l>I now was on my way.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Then, bear thy message;</l>
<l>Go, be the agent to destroy thy brother.</l>
<l>This compliment, I know, is but the prelude,</l>
<l>To invite a second Claudio, in Marcellus.</l>

<l>If peace be worth a wish, and love be such</l>

</sp>

<l>You never wish'd more wisely: but forgive me:</l>
<l>Pardon my infirmity, 'tis too like madness.</l>
</sp>

<l>Their words, their looks, let not a glance escape thee.</l>
<l>Promise me so, and from this hour, Olympia,</l>
<l>Thy prudence shall be my sole counsellor:</l>
<l>Though you enjoin me to be blind and mute,</l>

<l>And mount up to my cheek, at such glad tidings?</l>
<l>The time has been, I should have glow'd at this,</l>
<l><pb n="20" facs="27"/>Counting the impatient moments till her coming:—</l>
<l>But my repining heart deserves no blessings.</l>

<l>To labour to forget, I know, is vain;</l>

<l>Unprofitable all.</l>
<l>How have I dragg'd about this weary load,</l>
<l>Through every change of place and circumstance!</l>
<l>I mingled with the young, the gay, the happy;</l>
<l>Forcing a hollow smile at giddy joy,</l>
<l>While my pale heart sat mocking it within:</l>
<l>The arrow sticking here, from scene to scene</l>
<l>You led my sad insensibility,</l>
<l>The objects varying, but my soul the same.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLYMPIA.</speaker>
<l>Too much, I fear, we try'd, and you endur'd</l>
<l>Our well-meant, unavailing services.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Could I forbear, I would not weep, Olympia;</l>
<l>Indeed I would not; for it pains my friends.</l>
<l>'Twas such a black, unapprehended horrour,</l>

<l>I sometimes for a moment close my eyes,</l>

<l>That, quite awake, 'twill vanish from my brain;</l>
<l>That, still he lives, and I again shall see him:</l>
<l>Ah, no! the short illusion is the dream;</l>
<l>Claudio, thy death the dire reality.</l>

<speaker>OLYMPIA.</speaker>
<l>The volume of his days too soon was clos'd;</l>

<l>This was the hour, when my dear father came,</l>

<l>That instant, mighty ruler of our fates!</l>
<l>Had thy exterminating arm reach'd here,</l>

<l>Tame languid minds, whose course glides dully on,</l>
<l>Yield, as the stream to the sharp severing keel,</l>
<l>To close as quickly on each transient wound;</l>
<l>But woe's deep traces never leave thy breast.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Was I not mad, Olympia? I remember,</l>
<l>I felt the stab in Genoa.—When I wak'd,</l>
<l>The place, nor aught around me, were the fame:</l>
<l>I saw the smooth Bisagnio, as I lay,</l>
<l>Rolling his quiet tide beneath my window;</l>
<l>It seem'd Elysium, and the peaceful shades</l>
<l>Where guiltless lovers are no more divided.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLYMPIA.</speaker>
<l>But now, my friend, collect your fortitude;</l>
<l>Nor start, when you behold your Claudio's image</l>

<l>I know, he'll soon be here.</l>

<l>Why should I dread it?—</l>

<l>You turn pale, my Julia;</l>
<l>Shall I forbid his coming?</l>
</sp>

<l>No. This weakness</l>
<l>Will pass away. A treacherous hectick wastes me:</l>

<l>So very like his brother?</l>

<l>Features, stature,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>Lovely Julia,</l>
<l>In this embrace I hop'd to have clasp'd a daughter;</l>
<l>To have call'd thee mine, by an endearing tie,</l>
<l>That yields alone to nature's closest bond:</l>
<l>But though that fleet delusive dream is vanish'd,</l>
<l>With pride I own thy native excellence.</l>
<l>These eager throbbings, while I hold thee thus,</l>
<l>Are stronger protestations how I prize thee,</l>
<l>Than all the lavish praise my tongue could utter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Here let me grow for ever, none divide us!</l>
<l>Methinks, when these protecting arms enfold me,</l>
<l>Long-vanish'd peace seems to return once more,</l>
<l>And spread her dove-like wings again to shield me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>They told me truth, I never saw such beauty.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>Vile slander, on my life, has wrong'd her virtue.— <stage>aside,</stage></l>
<l>Have I not seem'd unkind, so many months</l>
<l>A stranger here, where ever-new delight</l>
<l>Sprung in our paths; where each returning morn,</l>
<l>Among the happy, found me happiest?</l>
<l>But O, I fear'd for thee, and for myself;</l>
<l>Our walks, these chambers, every senseless object,</l>
<l><pb n="27" facs="34"/>By known relation to our common loss,</l>
<l>Had conjur'd up to our accustom'd sense</l>
<l>Sad visions of his looks, his gestures, words,</l>
<l>And multiplied the ideas we should banish.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>I judg'd it not unkindness, for I know</l>
<l>Your generous nature feels for all who suffer.</l>
<l>And if to have been once supremely bless'd,</l>
<l>To have reach'd the height of every human wish,</l>
<l>Then sudden—but your swelling eyes reproach me.</l>
<l>You own'd him first, before his birth you lov'd him;</l>
<l>But O, this selfish grief forgets all titles.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>Yet join with me to bless that providence,</l>
<l>Which bending gracious to a parent's prayer,</l>
<l>'Midst all the perils of destructive war,</l>
<l>Preserv'd one pillar of my falling house.</l>
<l>Come near, my son; and in this fair perfection.</l>
<l>Behold, what, next to thee, the world contains</l>
<l>Most precious to thy mother.</l>

<l>Am I awake, or is this mockery?</l>
<l>O, I could gaze for ever on that face,</l>
<l>Nor wish to rouse me from the dear delusion.</l>
<l>Still let me know him only by my eyes!</l>
<l>O, do not speak, lest some unusual sound,</l>
<l>An alien to my ear, dissolve this vision,</l>
<l>And tell me thou but wear'st my Claudio's outside!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="28" facs="35"/>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>If it commend me, Madam, to your favour,</l>
<l>I would not change it for the comliest form</l>
<l>That ever charm'd the eye with fair proportion.</l>
<l>But stop not at the exterior, search me deeply;</l>
<l>For proof, command me instant to your service:</l>
<l>Though peril walk with death in the achievement,</l>
<l>Swifter than falcons through the trackless air</l>
<l>My eager thoughts shall fly to your obedience.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Take heed, take heed, tempt not the dangerous shore;</l>
<l>Rocks, shelves, and quicksands lurk, I fear, around me;</l>
<l>And let one gallant vessel's shipwreck warn thee,—</l>
<l>Shun the same course, and find a happier fortune.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>I fear no shelves, no quicksands, but thy frown.</l>
<l>Aw'd and enraptur'd I behold such beauty;</l>
<l>And while I talk thus, wish to find some language</l>
<l>Fit for a being of a sphere above me.</l>

<stage><hi>A</hi> Servant <hi>enters, and whispers</hi> OLYMPIA.</stage>

<l>Julia, a word. Mentevole attends, <stage><hi>to</hi> JULIA <hi>aside.</hi></stage></l>
<l>And asks to be admitted.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Now! Not now;</l>
<l>Indeed I cannot see him. Quick, my Olympia.</l>
<l>Prevent his entrance. My poor fluttering heart,</l>
<l>(If suddenly that name is founded to me,)</l>
<l>Beats, like a prison'd bird against its cage,</l>
<l>When some annoying hand is stretch'd to seize it.</l>

<pb n="29" facs="36"/>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Madam, this day which brings you back to us, <stage><hi>to</hi> FULVIA.</stage></l>
<l>We should make festival. Your presence here</l>
<l>Has wrought a miracle. I have not seen</l>
<l>A smile of joy enlighten that dear face,</l>
<l>Heaven knows how long, till you brought sunshine with you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>I have upbraidings for my absence, <hi>here;</hi></l>
<l>The cause, I'm sure, a false one. In atonement,</l>
<l>Let me observe her with a mother's care.</l>
<l>Invention shall be rack'd to find new means,</l>
<l>To lure her thoughts to sweet serenity.</l>
<l>She shall not see the frequent tears that wear</l>
<l>Their woeful channel down a parent's cheeks;</l>
<l>And to the brightest source of mortal comfort,</l>
<l>I will commend her, when I kneel to heaven.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>May plumes of seraphs waft your pious prayers!</l>
<l>The tenderness of women has a charm,</l>
<l>Our rougher natures can attain but rudely.</l>
<l>Your voices are such dulcet instruments,</l>
<l>They steal the listening soul from its affliction,</l>
<l>To wind it gently in the soft enchantment.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>O, may that power be mine! Observe, my Julia,</l>
<l>My lord commits you to my guardianship;</l>
<l>Do you confirm the trust?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>An outcast's fortune</l>

<l>To bend with reverence for your dear protection.</l>
</sp>

<l>Come, let us hence; the air is mild abroad.</l>
<l>Julia, we must not sink, but strive to banish</l>
<l>That restless inbred foe to the afflicted,</l>
<l>Reflection, from our bosoms.</l>
</sp>

<l>My soul and all its faculties go with her: <stage><hi>looking after</hi> JULIA.</stage></l>
<l>Grace, beauty, sweetness, all that captivates,</l>
<l>And holds us long in dear delicious bonds,</l>

<l>For change, or casualty, are summ'd up there.</l>
<l>Divinity of love, absolute master,</l>
<l>From this white hour, to thy all-potent sway</l>
<l>Thus I submit me: hence, all idle thoughts,</l>
<l>I chase you forth. Full-plum'd ambition, glory,</l>

<l>Pride and suspicion, in her violent temper,</l>
<l>From this short scroll will work rare mischief for me;</l>
<l>One spark will set her passions in a blaze:</l>
<l>A hint to her is proof demonstrative.—</l>
<l><pb n="31" facs="38"/>So,—I must bear this too; she will not see me,</l>
<l>Her health is delicate. But young Marcellus,</l>

<l>Soft as Favonius,—and a cherub's cheek</l>
<l>Is not so smooth and rosy. Precious minion!</l>
<l>They think me sure a tame enduring slave,</l>
<l>A trampled clod: they shall not find me such.</l>
<l>The scanty drop which once was patience here,</l>
<l>Flames as it flows, and kindles all my nature</l>

<l>Ay, there's the attraction. Thou unconscious house,</l>
<l>Thy turrets should be cased with beaten gold;</l>
<l>For thou enshrin'st a goddess.—Can it be?</l>
<l>Not three years pass'd, regardless of her charms</l>
<l>Day after day I saw her, and forgot them.</l>
<l>Or does the beauty of the full-blown rose</l>
<l>Surpass the promise of the opening bud?</l>
<l>I sure lov'd Claudio well; no brother's bond</l>
<l>Was truer to a brother; yet self! self!</l>
<l>This sudden flower now springs up from his grave,</l>
<l>That in a brother lies a rival buried.</l>

<l>My lord, well met. You then have seen this wonder.</l>
<l>Has fame exceeded, think you?</l>

<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Spoke Julia fairer than your eyes confess her?</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>All eyes, all hearts, with rapture must confess her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Then I must think, you do not mean to pine</l>
<l>In silent adoration?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>What bless'd strain</l>
<l>Can touch that gentle bosom?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Take my counsel;</l>
<l>Devote thy soul to any thing but love;</l>
<l>Steep thy drench'd senses in the mad'ning bowl;</l>
<l>Heap gold, and hug the mammon for itself;</l>
<l>Set provinces on dice; o'er the pale lamp</l>
<l>Of sickly science waste thy vigorous youth;</l>
<l>Rush to the war, or cheer the deep-tongu'd hound;</l>
<l>Be thou the proverb'd slave of each, or all;</l>
<l>They shall not be so noxious to thy soul,</l>
<l>As dainty woman's love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>If this be counsel,</l>
<l>It comes with such a harsh and boisterous breath,</l>
<l>I more discern the freedom, than the friendship.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Falsly our poets deck the barbarous god</l>
<l>With roseat hue, with infants' dimpling smiles,</l>
<l>With wanton curls, and wings of downy gold:—</l>
<l>He dips his darts in poisonous aconite;</l>
<l><pb n="33" facs="40"/>The firy venom rankles in our veins,</l>
<l>Infuses rage, and murderous cruelty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>The richest juice pour'd in a tainted jar,</l>
<l>Turns to a nauseous and unwholesome draught,</l>
<l>But we condemn the vessel, not the wine;</l>
<l>So gentle love, lodg'd in a savage breast,</l>
<l>May change his nature to a tyger's fierceness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Away with vain disguise! Mark me, my lord,</l>
<l>I long have lov'd this lady with a passion,</l>
<l>Too quick and jealous, not to find a rival,</l>
<l>Too fierce to brook him. She receives my vows;</l>
<l>Her father favours them. Wealth, titles, honour,</l>
<l>My rank in the state, and many fair additions</l>
<l>(Surpass'd by none) keep buoyant my full hopes.</l>
<l>If yet your heart's untouch'd, I ask, entreat it,</l>
<l>(And strangers grant such common courtesies,)</l>
<l>Forbear your visits to her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Believe this;</l>
<l>Were there a fasting lion in my path,</l>
<l>I'd rather this good steel here by my side</l>
<l>Should grow one piece with the sheath, or in my grasp</l>
<l>Shrink to a bulrush, but to mock the wielder,</l>
<l>Than feed you with the smallest hope or promise</l>
<l>I mean, not to fulfil.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Then we are foes.</l>

<sp>

<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Deadly, irreconcilable.</l>
<l>Two eager racers starting for one goal,</l>
<l>Both cannot win, but shame must find the loser.</l>
<l>You step between me, and the light of heaven,</l>
<l>You strive to rob me of my life's best hope,</l>
<l>(For life without her were my curse, my burden,)</l>
<l>With cruel calmness you pluck out my heart;</l>
<l>Therefore, were the world's bounds more wide and large,</l>

<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Yonder herd,</l>

<l>O, enough; forbear</l>

<l>The meek demeanour of repenting rashness;</l>
<l>And to the foe I hate, thus bending, cry,</l>
<l><hi>Forgive me,</hi> since you will it. Yet remember,</l>
<l>I thus degrade me in mine own esteem,</l>
<l>Only to rise in yours. Your liberal nature</l>
<l>Will give my free compliance its best gloss.</l>
<l>It shews your full dominion o'er my soul,</l>
<l>That joyfully prefers your least command,</l>

<l>Then fiercely burn'd for this enchanting Julia;</l>
<l>Yet, from respect for his precedent claim,</l>

<l>I kept the painful secret. He so lov'd me,</l>

<l>Good Mentevole,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>No, this only.</l>
<l>I cannot speak, or think, of aught but her:</l>
<l>She is my essence; feeds, wakes, sleeps, with me;</l>
<l>Is vital to me as the air I breathe.</l>
<l>But mark, I am compos'd; no violence</l>
<l>Lives in my thoughts, or shall disgrace my tongue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Then, lest I move your temper, let me leave you.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>No, pr'ythee no, not thus unsatisfied.</l>
<l>I'll not contend, but her transcendent beauty,</l>
<l>Even at first sight, must strike the gazer's eye</l>
<l>With admiration, which might <hi>grow</hi> to love.</l>
<l>But is it possible, <hi>one</hi> interview,</l>
<l>(For you but once have seen her,) should so root</l>
<l>Her image in your soul, that all your bliss,</l>
<l>Or future misery, depends on her?</l>

<speaker>MARCELLES.</speaker>
<l>Regard not me, but reason for yourself.</l>
<l>If all your faithful vows, your length of courtship,</l>
<l>Her father's favour, and the nameless aids</l>
<l>Which time and opportunity have furnish'd,</l>
<l>Raise not your hopes above a rival's power;</l>
<l>Say, were it not more wise, and manly too,</l>
<l>To rouse, and shake off such a hard dominion?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>How cold you talk? Good heaven! I might as well</l>
<l>Resolve to change my nature; bid my ear</l>
<l>See for my eye, or turn my blood to milk;</l>
<l>New-stamp my features, and new-mould my limbs;</l>
<l>Make this soft flesh, that yields to every print,</l>
<l>Impassive as thin air; waste time and thought</l>
<l>On any wild impossibility;</l>
<l>As be the thing I am, and cease to love her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Then take, my lord, your course, while I shall follow</l>

<head>SCENE I. <stage>A Chamber in <hi>Durazzo's</hi> Palace.</stage></head>
<stage>DURAZZO, MARCELLUS, <hi>and</hi> CAMILLO.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Not so, not so; deem me not lost to reason;</l>
<l>My breast is ever open to receive you.</l>
<l>Though Fulvia's son, I hold you not allied</l>
<l>To Fulvia's enmity, and violence.</l>
<l>Nay, were we foes, (which I should grieve to think,)</l>
<l>The qualities and virtue of Marcellus</l>
<l>Could find no tongue more prompt in their report,</l>
<l>Than old Durazzo's.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>My much honour'd lord,</l>
<l>These friendly sounds are cordials to my ear.</l>
<l>Soon as I heard my mother's frantick tale,</l>
<l>(Though tears and exclamations scarce gave room</l>
<l>For her distemper'd rage to tell the story,)</l>
<l>Such consternation seiz'd me, as if earth</l>
<l>Convuls'd had yawn'd at once beneath my feet,</l>
<l>And livid flames shot upwards to consume me,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Did I not scorn to mate a woman's malice,</l>
<l>What vengeful spunge, though steep'd in Stygian gall,</l>
<l>Could wipe away my deep-dy'd injuries?</l>
<l>My house's ancient honour set at nonght;</l>
<l>The little spark of health, which, just rekindling,</l>
<l>Glow'd in the check of my dear innocent child,</l>
<l><pb n="56" facs="63"/>And warm'd her father's hopes, rudely extinguish'd;</l>
<l>Her name that like a holy word was utter'd,</l>
<l>Grace and good will still ushering the sound,</l>
<l>Cast for vile question to the publick streets,</l>
<l>'Midst scurril casuists, and the lees of Genoa:—</l>
<l>By my just rage, the sanctity of virtue</l>
<l>Never sustain'd so gross a profanation.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>With burning blushes, as the shame were mine,</l>
<l>And hooting crowds made me derision's scoff,</l>
<l>I own the justice of a father's anger.</l>
<l>Descend, mild patience, to her harrow'd breast!</l>
<l>What fortitude can arm her feeling heart</l>
<l>Against the rankling barb of this fell arrow?</l>
<l>'Gainst galling taunts, 'gains mortal accusations,</l>
<l>From lips whose every sound should sooth and bless her?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>The malice of a foe may be endur'd;</l>
<l>But friendship's stab,—the very plank we cling to</l>
<l>Turn'd to a barbarous engine for destruction!—</l>
<l>And yet her gentle, her forgiving nature</l>
<l>Unwillingly permits my just reproach;</l>
<l>She checks my indignation, by rememb'ring,</l>
<l>How kind, how tender, Fulvia once was to her;</l>
<l>And how the exalted virtues of her soul</l>
<l>Transcend her frailties, and efface this error.</l>

<head>SCENE II.</head>
<stage><hi>Enter an</hi> Officer.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>Be on your guard, my lord; we have certain notice,</l>
<l>The rabble stir'd up by some strange report,</l>
<l>Mustering from every quarter are assembled,</l>
<l>And threaten insult here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>I thank you, sir.</l>
<l>Let them come on, we are prepar'd to meet them.</l>
<l>The love of tumult, and not zeal for justice,</l>
<l>Is their great principle. What think you now?</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Officer.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>The wretch arraign'd, whose gasping expectation</l>
<l>Hangs on the aweful pause that dooms or saves him,</l>
<l>Feels peace and bliss to what my breast endures,</l>
<l>Till, prostrate at her feet, I clear my honour,</l>
<l>My reason, and each spark of manhood in me,</l>
<l>From vile concurrence in this monstrous outrage.</l>
<l>This instant lead me to her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>Hold, Marcellus.</l>
<l>We must not give too loose a rein to passion,</l>
<l>At such a trembling crisis. Good my lord, <stage><hi>to</hi> DURAZZO.</stage></l>
<l>To check the shameful licence, and disorder,</l>
<l>Which hourly spread more wide by our inaction,</l>
<l>One way at least is plain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="58" facs="65"/>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>My mind's distracted.</l>
<l>I should before have told you our resolves;</l>
<l>But my vex'd spirit this way finds relief,</l>
<l>And vents itself in railing. But 'tis thus.</l>
<l>The duke, (and much I'm bound to thank his grace.)</l>
<l>Though urg'd to every harsh extremity</l>
<l>By that fierce woman, kindly has determin'd</l>
<l>To take the milder course. Himself in person,</l>
<l>When I appoint the hour, will visit us.</l>
<l>He knows already every circumstance,</l>
<l>In its true state, nor heeds our foe's perversion;</l>
<l>And resting so, with honour I must own,</l>
<l>Suspicion has its mark.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>Mentevole.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>My favour to that lord, his daily boast,</l>
<l>The prattle of this busy babbling city,</l>
<l>Pregnant and positive in slanderous falshoods,</l>
<l>The picture dropp'd by him, and found with Julia,</l>
<l>But most, her secret meeting him this morning,</l>
<l>(Which, till explain'd, gives colour to suggestion,)</l>
<l>Have so perversely wound us in the snare;</l>
<l>We stand, like him, expos'd the common butt</l>
<l>For every shaft of venom'd calumny.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MASCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Heavens, can it be? That angel! she expos'd</l>
<l>To bear the prying eye, the insidious question,</l>
<l>Of proud, unfeeling, quaint authority;</l>
<l><pb n="59" facs="66"/>Each sauntering varlet, worthless of the honour</l>
<l>To strew her paths with rushes, unabash'd</l>
<l>Gaze on the emotions of her lovely face,</l>
<l>And find a heighten'd zest in her confusion!</l>
<l>I will not trust myself to wear my sword,</l>
<l>Lest, with a firy instinct, from my side</l>
<l>It start at once, and in their blood avenge her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>Reason and justice are her best avengers.</l>
<l>Be calm then, good Marcellus; hear the means.</l>
<l>Just now, an order issued from the state,</l>
<l>That none should pass the city's suburb gates,</l>
<l>Nor vessel leave the port, till the duke's licence</l>
<l>Permits the usual egress. This, though pointed</l>
<l>But at Mentevole, being general,</l>
<l>Wounds not his pride; nor can awake suspicion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>I fear the wise precaution was in vain;</l>
<l>Suspicion will awake, when conscience sleeps not,</l>
<l>And his—but I am to blame;—appearances</l>
<l>Are indexes full oft which point to error.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMILLO.</speaker>
<l>His sister, as we learn; has sought a convent,</l>
<l>And will no more be found.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>I pity her,</l>
<l>Poor wretch! unconsciously, the instrument</l>
<l>To speed perhaps a brother's infamy:</l>
<l>But all she knew already is divulg'd.</l>
<l><pb n="60" facs="67"/>Keep eye, Camillo, on Mentevole.</l>
<l>For you, dear youth, be sure, no mean mistrust</l>
<l>Unworthy my esteem, and your high honour,</l>
<l>Can ever harbour here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Yet, O, Durazzo,</l>
<l>I feel but half assur'd. An ugly shame,</l>
<l>Chilling the native freedom of my spirit,</l>
<l>Hangs on me, loads me, drags me to the ground.</l>
<l>Nor can I shake the vile dejection off,</l>
<l>Till sweeter than the gale from new-born flowers;</l>
<l>Her balmy lips breathe peace into my bosom.</l>
<l>Will you not lead me to her?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Yes, Marcellus,</l>
<l>Deplore with me the ruins of a mind</l>
<l>Where nature lavish'd every grace and virtue,</l>
<l>To make misfortune still more eminent.</l>
<l>Come then, let's on.—Without there? <stage><hi>Enter</hi> Sarv.</stage> Is my daughter</l>
<l>Still in her chamber?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<l>She but now was seen,</l>
<l>Without attendants, near the orange grove.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Ere we return here, should the duke arrive,</l>
<l>You'll find us near the grove. Now I attend you. <stage><hi>to</hi> MAR.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<l>My lord, the stranger we this morn admitted,</l>
<l>Waits in the outward chamber.—If your leisure—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="61" facs="68"/>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>I had forgot. Good man! yes, bid him enter. <stage><hi>Exit</hi> Serv.</stage></l>
<l>Marcellus, for a moment, pardon me.</l>

<stage>DURAZZO, <hi>alone.</hi></stage>

<l>I am too bold.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>No, worthy Manoa;</l>
<l>Pride may intrude, but not the unfortunate.</l>
<l>But how? Thy cheeks are pale; thy started eye</l>
<l>Looks fearfully around. What sudden terrour</l>
<l>Shakes thus thy manhood?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANOA.</speaker>
<l>O, my gracious lord,</l>
<l>In vain I hoped, your pity and protection</l>
<l>Might be stretch'd forth to screen me from my foes.</l>
<l>The cruel vigilance of fate has found me;</l>
<l>I am discover'd, lost.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="62" facs="69"/>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>I trust, not so.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANOA.</speaker>
<l>A dreadful order is but now gone forth,</l>
<l>To close the port up, and the city gates.</l>
<l>It must be meant 'gainst me; to hem me in,</l>
<l>And yield my life to cruel men who hate me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>Dismiss that fear, I know the cause too well;</l>
<l>'Tis distant far from thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Indeed?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>MANOA.</speaker>
<l>I breathe again. May every blessing crown you!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURAZZO.</speaker>
<l>I know your innocence, and will not fail</l>
<l>To impress the duke and senate in your favour.</l>
<l>Nor can I think but for some special end</l>
<l>A providence so visible preserv'd you.</l>
<l>Mean time, take comfort to you, and rest here,</l>
<l>Secure; these walls shall be your sanctuary.</l>

<sp>
<stage>MENTEVOLE, <hi>alone. A Whistle is heard.</hi></stage>
<l>Hark! that's my signal. Then she's near the grove:</l>
<l>And see, a woman's form. Be firm, my heart!</l>
<l>No fluttering now. Let dire necessity</l>
<l>(That in itself contains all arguments)</l>
<l>Fix its strong fiat on my resolution,</l>
<l>And cancel nature's fear. She must be mine.</l>
<l>I have buffetted beyond the midway flood;</l>
<l>Nor shall my sinews shrink so near the shore.</l>
<l>But come the worst, 'gainst shame and disappointment,</l>
<l>Thou sharp, but friendly leech, I will apply thee.</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> JULIA.</stage>
<l>No, I must still endure; for death is proud,</l>

<l><pb n="64" facs="71"/>The happy who avoid him, he pursues;</l>
<l>And with malignant triumph loves to enter,</l>

<stage><hi>seeing</hi> MENTEVOLE, <hi>she starts.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Why start you, madam? Have a few short hours</l>
<l>So chang'd the man you sought, nay, kinder still,</l>
<l>With gentle intercession sooth'd, and won</l>
<l>To mercy for a rival, that a serpent</l>
<l>Rising on mortal spires to sting your life,</l>
<l>Could not excite more horrour than his presence?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Thou art, indeed, a serpent, coil'd for mischief;</l>
<l>To dart out on the unwary, drink his blood,</l>
<l>And slink again to thy dark lurking place.</l>
<l>Why art thou here?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>To talk to thee of love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Of murder rather.—Hence!<stage>going.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>I must detain you. <stage>holding her.</stage></l>
<l>A moment is not long. And can thy wisdom,</l>
<l>For such a feather, for one light surmise,</l>
<l>That picture, rashly deem me capable</l>
<l>Of shedding human blood, nay, a friend's blood?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="65" facs="72"/>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Of every crime I deem thee capable:</l>
<l>Thy furious temper knows no sacred bond;</l>
<l>Death on thyself, even kneeling at my feet,</l>
<l>Thou hast vow'd with frantick oaths. O, patient heaven!</l>
<l>Why did not fire from yon insulted sky</l>
<l>Consume him quick, ere his pernicious rage</l>
<l>Had plung'd me in this gulph of wretchedness?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>I am so clear from any conscious taint,</l>
<l>On that foul charge, I would not waste a moment</l>
<l>To purge me of so gross a villainy.</l>
<l>What state, what sex, what excellence of mind,</l>
<l>E'er found an armour against calumny?</l>
<l>Give the most monstrous slander but a birth,</l>
<l>Folly shall own, and malice cherish it.</l>
<l>It moves but my contempt. Consider this,</l>
<l>Art not thou too accus'd? thy spotless self,</l>
<l>Alike call'd criminal? by what? by madness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>I thank thee, yes. Thy most unwelcome love,</l>
<l>Like some contagious vapour breath'd upon me,</l>
<l>Has made me loathsome to the publick view:</l>
<l>The persecution of thy hateful vows,</l>
<l>That first disturb'd my peace, now blasts my honour.</l>
<l>I stand a poor, defam'd, suspected creature:</l>
<l>The eyes, whose gentle pity balm'd my sorrows,</l>
<l>Now turn their beams with indignation on me;</l>
<l>And thou the cause of all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>You hate me then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="66" facs="73"/>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Hate thee! the term's too weak. 'Tis vital horrour:</l>
<l>The helpless dove views not the ravening kite,</l>
<l>With such instinctive dread, and detestation.</l>
<l>The principle by which we start from death,—</l>
<l>Crave needful food,—nature's original print</l>
<l>To shun our evil, and pursue our good,</l>
<l>By reason strengthen'd with increasing age,</l>
<l>Are not so mix'd, and general through my frame.</l>
<l>Hence from my eyes! Thy sight is deadly to me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>O, thou unthankful beauty! think a little,</l>
<l>How envy'd, but for thee, had been my lot:</l>
<l>My youth had glided down life's easy stream,</l>
<l>With every sail out-spread for every pleasure.</l>
<l>But since the hour I saw thy fatal charms,</l>
<l>My bosom has been hell. How I have lov'd,</l>
<l>All my neglected duties of the world,</l>
<l>Friends, parents, interest, country, all forgotten.</l>
<l>Cry out against me; now I count the exchange,</l>
<l>And find all barter'd for thy hate and scorn.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Dar'st thou upbraid me, or assume a pride</l>
<l>Even from the homely meanness of thy soul,</l>
<l>Thy long ungenerous importunity?</l>
<l>Mere sensual love, contented with the outside?</l>
<l>The pure, exalted, incorporeal flame,</l>
<l>Fann'd not by sympathy's soft breath, expires.</l>
<l>I never gave thee hope, no, not a look,</l>
<l>Thy vanity could construe into kindness.</l>
<l>I play'd no hypocrite; my heart at once</l>
<l>Diffus'd its honest dictates to my eyes;</l>
<l><pb n="67" facs="74"/>They told thee my aversion, my disdain;</l>
<l>And were this air the last I should respire,</l>
<l>Here, in the face of heaven, my tongue confirms them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>O eloquence of hatred! noble candour!</l>
<l>I am thy fool no more, my doubts are vanish'd.</l>
<l>Thou hast not left in all my swelling veins,</l>
<l>One cold compunctious drop, to chill my purpose:</l>
<l>The lover scorn'd, the man now rouses here.</l>
<l>Mark me, ungrateful!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Ha! what means the traitor?<stage>aside.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>This garden leads to mine; the passages</l>
<l>Are all secur'd. A ready priest within</l>
<l>Waits to unite us; therefore yield at once;</l>
<l>Vain is resistance. If I raise my voice,</l>
<l>Four faithful slaves behind yon thicket lodg'd,</l>
<l>Will bear thee off.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Am I betray'd thus vilely?</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Look round, no aid is near thee. Thou art mine:</l>

<l>Satiate thy rage;</l>
<l>With new-invented cruelty deface me;</l>
<l>I will but smile at the uplifted steel,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Have a care!</l>
<l>I mean thee no dishonour; but these struggles,</l>
<l>That heaving bosom, those resistless beams,</l>
<l>Darting their subtle heat through all my frame,</l>
<l>May fire my senses to so wild a tumult,—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>O, fatal thought! I will choke in my breath;</l>
<l>Fall lifeless here. Is there no pitying power?</l>
<l>Are prayers in vain above?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>As empty air.</l>
<l>Love only wakes, for he inspires my ardour.</l>
<l>O, fond reluctance! must I call for aid?</l>
<l>No, gently thus— <stage>stooping to raise her, in the struggle, the dagger falls from his breast, which she seizes instantly, and rises.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Ha! was it sent from heaven?</l>
<l>Lo, thine own dagger. See, I grasp it strongly:</l>
<l>Now, monster, I defy thee.</l>

<l>The righteous guardian of the innocent</l>
<l>Has look'd from yon bright firmament to earth,</l>
<l>And sends this timely succour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Meddling daemons,</l>
<l>In black confed'racy combin'd against me,</l>
<l>Turn all my engines to their own destruction.</l>
<l>Yet hear with patience—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>If thou dar'st approach me,</l>
<l>Stir but thy foot, or call thy bate associates,—</l>
<l>Swift as the ray that darts from yonder orb,</l>
<l>(I feel the artery here,) this friendly point</l>
<l>Shall pierce my heart, and, as death's shades close round me,</l>
<l>I'll bless the night which shuts thee out for ever.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Obdurate as thou art, alas, my dotage</l>
<l>Would still preserve thee; and implores thee, pardon</l>
<l>The mad attempt by desperation prompted.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Sunk to the lowest in my esteem before,</l>
<l>Lower thou could'st not fall. Degrading guilt,</l>
<l>How mean, how abject, are the souls which own thee!</l>
<l>How vile thy thraldom! See the baffled ruffian,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>'Tis true, too true; my astonish'd eyes beheld it.</l>
<l>The duke is come, is in the hall this instant;</l>
<l>And (shame to Genoa!) armed guards are posted,</l>
<l>To save this palace from the people's outrage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>O, if my prayers have any power to move you,</l>
<l>Or, if you would not add to my distress,</l>
<l>(Most sure you cannot mean it,) I implore you,</l>
<l>Wide, as if spotted plagues encompass'd me,</l>
<l>Avoid me, fly me, in fierce Fulvia's presence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>With joy, in all but this, I would obey you.</l>
<l>Shall I retire, and seem to abet a cause,</l>
<l>By tame neutrality, and timorous silence,</l>
<l>Which, but to think of, chills my heart's warm blood,</l>
<l>And drives my sober sense to wild amazement?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Think then what I feel here! yet, O, remember</l>
<l>She has a parent's claim to your respect;</l>
<l>And how I lov'd her, heaven that knows can witness;</l>
<l>In publick to confront her, might enkindle</l>
<l>Her rage to madness. Has she not accus'd me</l>
<l>(O, that I could forget it!) of such crimes,</l>
<l>As calumny's foul lips might shrink to utter?</l>
</sp>

<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Her's is the shame, but our's, alas, the anguish.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Stung thus to frenzy, she would hurl on me</l>
<l>Your disobedience; all her house's woe</l>
<l>Impute to me alone, unhappy me;</l>
<l>While trembling, sinking, I could but oppose</l>
<l>The feeble shield of innocence and tears.</l>
<l>No, justice must for once give way to duty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>O, do not freeze me with so cold a word;</l>
<l>Nor wrong the ardours of my glowing bosom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>The great disposer of events on earth,</l>
<l>For some unsearchable, mysterious end,</l>
<l>Has pleas'd to mark me for adversity.</l>
<l>With constancy unshaken, my firm soul</l>
<l>Shall meet the black succession of my fates.</l>
<l>When the full storm has emptied all its fury,</l>
<l>This shatter'd bark may sink at length to peace;</l>
<l>And the last wave that rolls the welcome death,</l>

<l>Who that has sense and soul to feel perfection,</l>
<l>And witness'd thy unrivall'd excellence;</l>
<l>Can let thee be forgotten? Hear, O, hear me!</l>
<l>I Can no more suppress my burning passion;</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>Is this an hour for love?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>At every hour,</l>
<l>(Enchanting as thou art) thy eyes command it.</l>
<l>Thus on my knee I seize the blest occasion,</l>
<l>To tell thee all thy wond'rous charms inspire,</l>
<l>Though ages might glide by, ere half was utter'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIA.</speaker>
<l>There is an aweful witness of this scene,</l>
<l>For ever present here, who hovers round me.</l>
<l>Through the still void I hear a solemn voice;</l>
<l>On his pale lips the unwilling accents hang:</l>
<l>Our vows, he cries, were register'd above;</l>
<l>For thee my breast was pierc'd; see this red wound,</l>
<l>Nor lose the memory in a brother's arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>What canst thou mean? Why do thy lovely eyes</l>
<l>Thus waste their beams on air? O, turn them here,</l>
<l>To warm my breast, and light up ecstacy!</l>

<l>Or my frail heart forget its early passion!</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>All the most tender interest can inspire,</l>

<l>The object, and the passion died with him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLUS.</speaker>
<l>Too near, and too remote. It cannot be:</l>
<l>For, O, 'tis lingering torment, hourly death,</l>
<l>To touch the cup might quench our fever's thirst,</l>

<sp>
<l>Know you, my lord,</l>
<l>Why we assemble here?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Yes. Clamour's throat</l>
<l>Has roar'd it in our streets. I pass'd along</l>
<l>Through files of obloquy. Our sapient rabble</l>
<l>Reverse the order of the magistracy,</l>

<sp>

<l>Then, my lord,</l>
<l>As you regard your honour, and your life,</l>
<l>Touch'd by suspicion to the quick, this instant</l>
<l>Account for your possession of that picture.</l>
<l>That lady there, dead Claudio's mother, swears,</l>
<l>It was her son's, and worn around his neck</l>
<l>The day he disappear'd. Behold, do you know it?</l>
<l>Do you allow you dropp'd it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>Yes; but not</l>
<l>That it was Claudio's. Yet, I cannot wonder,</l>
<l>Two objects so alike, should seem the same.</l>

<l>Have patience, gentle lady.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>I say, should <hi>seem;</hi> for it is barely seeming.</l>
<l>From that which Claudio own'd, (the artist's boast,)</l>
<l><pb n="78" facs="85"/>Myself, not meanly in the science skill'd,</l>
<l>Painted this picture; love, my pencil's guide;</l>
<l>And, from the image in my heart engrav'd,</l>
<l>Assisted by the model, such I made it,</l>
<l>That not the most discerning, nicest eye</l>
<l>From the first beauteous draught could know that copy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>And had you skill to paint those jewels too,</l>
<l>Those jewels in the round? their hue and lustre</l>
<l>So singular, and bright? By every power,</l>
<l>These were my son's.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENTEVOLE.</speaker>
<l>No. Give me hearing, madam.</l>
<l>Those too I purchas'd from the very merchant</l>
<l>Who furnish'd Claudio. All who hear me, know</l>
<l>The name of Manoa; his services</l>
<l>To this ungrateful state; his flight, his death;</l>
<l>Which I lament, since living, he could witness,</l>
<l>And strike you dumb, that by my special order</l>
<l>He chose these precious gems, in form and colour</l>
<l>So like to Claudio's, none could mark distinction.</l>
<l>To pay their value, my estate was strain'd;</l>
<l>But had their estimation been twice doubled,</l>
<l>A crown imperial deem'd the mighty price,</l>
<l>Rather than yield him preference in aught</l>
<l>Might seem a test of my extravagant love,</l>
<l>I would have grasp'd at it; and so remain'd</l>
<l>The ruin'd, happy lord of that sole treasure.</l>

<l>(No proof appearing to the contrary,)</l>
<l>If this be so, your honour seems acquitted.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FULVIA.</speaker>
<l>But not to me. O, undiscerning lord!</l>
<l>Is this your inquisition, this your justice?</l>
<l>I am not satisfied; my heart still tells me,</l>
<l>That picture was my son's; so reason tells me;</l>
<l>Nor should a voucher from the yawning grave</l>
<l>Shake my conviction.—That good Manoa</l>
<l>Did sell these jewels to my slaughter'd son;</l>
<l>And he, 'tis true, conveniently is dead:</l>
<l>But he had heirs and kindred; summon them;</l>
<l>A treasure such as this, could not be sold</l>
<l>Without their knowledge; instantly convene them,</l>
<l>And act through shame, as if you sought for truth;</l>
<l>Else, your grave robes will be the jest of boys,</l>
<l>And my son's blood will cry till death against you.</l>

<l>My sentence here I know; the rest's uncertain.</l>
<l>But least of all, fair sorceress! that tongue</l>

<l>Thou, thou, the cause of all this guilt and ruin.</l>
<l>Why did I kill my friend? Why, but for thee,</l>
<l>Why risk my soul's perdition? Still for thee.</l>

<l>The pain of this deep wound is light, my father;</l>

<l>Hide me, O earth! I tremble to approach.——</l>
<l>Has thy soft generous heart one drop of mercy,</l>

<l>Rise, madam, rise. These supplicating hands,</l>

<l>Thou saint-like goodness!</l>

<head>EPILOGUE;</head>
<byline>Written by JOHN COURTENAY, Esq.</byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. SIDDONS.</byline>
<sp>
<l>THOUGH tender sighs breathe in the tragick page,</l>
<l>What lover now complains—but on the stage?</l>
<l>No suitor now attempts his rival's life,</l>
<l>But lets him take that cordial balm—a wife:</l>
<l>And yet, to prove his pure and constant flame,</l>
<l>Still loves his mistress in the wedded dame;</l>
<l>Still courts his friend, and still devoutly bows</l>
<l>At the fair shrine where first he breath'd his vows.</l>
<l>For love, she knows some gratitude is due,</l>
<l>Searches her heart, and finds there's room for two;</l>
<l>And often sees, her coy reluctance o'er,</l>
<l>Good cause to prize her <hi>caro sposo</hi> more.</l>
<l>Thus modish wives, with sentimental spirit,</l>
<l>May go astray, to prove their husbands' merit,—</l>
<l>Or ope the door, in this commodious age,</l>
<l>Without death's aid, to 'scape from wedlock's cage.—</l>
<l>Abjuring rules, that soon will seem romance,</l>
<l>Love's gayer system we import from France;</l>
<l>Rescind politely our old English <hi>duty,</hi></l>
<l>And take off all restraints from wine and beauty;</l>
<l>While lighter manners cheer our native gloom,</l>
<l>As Spanish wool refines the British loom.</l>
<l>Had fashion's law of old such influence shed,</l>
<l>The raptur'd Claudio ne'er had timeless bled:</l>
<l>His bliss with joy Mentevole had seen,</l>
<l>And Julia's favourite Cicishe' had been.</l>
<l>The assiduous lover, and the husband bland,</l>
<l>Like Brentford's kings, had still walk'd hand in hand;</l>
<l>Together still had shone at Park, and play,</l>
<l>Quaffing the fragrance of the same bouquet.</l>
<l><pb facs="98" ana="y"/>Our varlet poet, with licentious speech,</l>
<l>Thus far our injur'd sex has dar'd <hi>impeach.</hi></l>
<l>The female character thus rudely slurr'd,</l>
<l>'Tis fit, at last, that <hi>I</hi> should have a word.—</l>
<l>First then, without rejoinder or dispute,</l>
<l>This <hi>virtuous</hi> circle might each <hi>charge</hi> refute.</l>
<l>That 'tis a <hi>nuptial age,</hi> I sure may say,</l>
<l>With their own wives when husbands run away.—</l>
<l>But truce with jest. Howe'er the wits may rail,</l>
<l>The cause of truth and virtue must prevail.</l>
<l>Of former times whatever may be told,</l>
<l>We are just as good as e'er they were of old.</l>
<l>Connubial Love here long has fix'd his throne,</l>
<l>And bliss is ours, to foreign climes unknown.</l>
<l>If <hi>now and then</hi> a tripping fair is sound,</l>
<l>On Scandal's wings the buzzing tale flies round:</l>
<l>While blameless <hi>thousands,</hi> in sequester'd life,</l>
<l>Adorn each state, of parent, friend, and wife;</l>
<l>From private cares ne'er wish abroad to roam,</l>
<l>And bless, each day, the sunshine of their home;</l>
<l>Unnoticed keep their noiseless happy course,</l>
<l>Nor dream of second wedlock or divorce.—</l>
<l>I see the verdict's ours; you smile applause;</l>
<l>So, with your leave, again I'll plead our cause;</l>
<l>New triumphs nightly o'er this railer gain,</l>
<l>And to the last our female rights maintain.</l>
