<p>Love at a Venture. A COMEDY. As it is ACTED By his Grace, the Duke of <hi>Grafton</hi>'s Servants, AT THE NEW THEATRE IN BATH.</p>
<p>Written by the Author of the <hi>Gamester.</hi></p>

<head>To his Grace, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> Marquiss and Earl of <hi>Worcester,</hi> Baron <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Gower, Rawland, Chepstow, &amp;c.</hi></head>

<p>IT has been a general, and allow'd Custom, in all Ages, for Poets, to lay their Works at some Great Man's Feet, and always to chuse such as are eminently Conspicuous for their Vertues. This made <hi>Horace</hi> single out <hi>Mecenas,</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> court the Protection of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Lelius;</hi> which encourages me, in humble Imitation of those Great Men, to beg <hi>your Grace's</hi> Pratronage for the following Scenes. It would be a kind of Poetical Sacrilege to offer them else where, since it wou'd rob <hi>your Grace</hi> of the Homage, to which your Quality, Sense, and good Nature, your Indulgence to Poetry, and your Judgment as well as Love for Musick, give you an indisputable Title. Musick is the Soul of Poesy, and
<pb facs="4"/>
Numbers sound most sweet, when grac'd with soft harmonious Strains.</p>
<p>I am the more forward, to pay this just Debt, <hi>My Lord,</hi> because without the help of Fiction, consequently without the help of Flattery, I have a large Field for a Panegyrick; which, however, I shall prudently decline, for fear of degrading your Vertues through my Inability and Meanness of Expression. Yet I cannot forbear mentioning the Excellency of <hi>your Grace's</hi> Temper, your Goodness and Affability, and the Regard you have for that generous Custom, which formerly distinguish'd the <hi>English</hi> Nation, from all the rest of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> Hospitality: which makes <hi>your Grace</hi> admired, and beloved to a degree, next Adoration, by all, who are so happy as to approach you.</p>
<p><hi>Your Grace,</hi> is a true Pattern of Nobility: The prudent Management of your Affairs; your Voluntary Retreat from Noise and Vice, shew you have a right Conception of the Joys of Life, as <hi>Cowley</hi> has describ'd them. To favour your Retirement, Nature seems to have taken peculiar Care to indulge <hi>your Grace's</hi> Solitude, with all her choice Productions: For your Gardens exceed all that Poets feign.</p>
<p><pb facs="5"/>
That <hi>your Grace,</hi> may long enjoy those Blessings in perfect Health, and unmolested Peace, together with your Beauteous Lady; and that your Connubial Joys may produce a perfect Copy of their Parents, which may adorn the Age to come, with the same Singularity of Goodness, as <hi>your Grace</hi> does the present; are, <hi>My Lord,</hi> the sincere Wishes of,</p>
<closer><signed>Your Graces, most Obedient, most Devoted, Humble Servant, <hi>Susanna Carroll.</hi></signed></closer>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<l>LEast any here shou'd blame our Author's toil,</l>
<l>For stroling with her Boat a Hundred Mile.</l>
<l>By me to such, She does this Reason give,</l>
<l>Seeing how many Men by Ventures live.</l>
<l>She straight embark'd, and hoisted Sail to try,</l>
<l>What pure good Nature in these Bottoms lye.</l>
<l>Beside, she hop'd, she might divert you too,</l>
<l>By adding to your Pleasures something new.</l>
<l>The Vertue of these Baths had ne're been known,</l>
<l>If or'e these Hills, no Man had ventur'd down.</l>
<l>Here Doctors Venturing, come in hopes of Fees,</l>
<l>And Patients Venture, on their Skill for Ease,</l>
<l>For Wealth, the Merchant Ventures on the Seas.</l>
<l>The Lawyer Ventures upon any Cause,</l>
<l>And Venturing Client's begger'd by the Laws.</l>
<l>The Lover Ventures, to Address the Fair,</l>
<l>With broken Speeches, and dejected Air,</l>
<l>She runs a Venture, who relieves his care.</l>
<l>The Gamester Ventures, to improve his Store,</l>
<l>And having lost, he Ventures on for more.</l>
<l>The <hi>London</hi> Punk, in Garret shut all Day,</l>
<l>At Night, with last half Crown she Ventures to the Play.</l>
<l>The Amorous Cully, meeting with the Miss,</l>
<l>Ventures at Water-Gruel for a Kiss.</l>
<l>Since every Man, Adventures in his way,</l>
<l>Hither our Author ventur'd with her Play.</l>
<l>And hopes her Profits will her Charge defray,</l>
<l>If that bright Circle Ventures to adorn her Day.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE,</head>
<stage>Spoken by Miss <hi>Jacobella Power.</hi></stage>
<l>IN spight of dull insipid Rules, I'm come,</l>
<l>To learn what Fate attends my Virgin Bloom.</l>
<l>Strange things I've heard this Night, that makes me fear,</l>
<l>Least I shou'd find such Entertainment here.</l>
<l>You Men are grown so witty in Deceit,</l>
<l>That We, poor Girls, are often ruin'd by't.</l>
<l>'Tis pitty—but I hope to cross this Play,</l>
<l>And be reveng'd on you some other way.</l>
<l>Well—but consider, We are tender Things,</l>
<l>That Innocence, and sprightly Beauty brings.</l>
<l>Soft Accents, broken Words, and yielding Air,</l>
<l>Are all the Weapons, that attend the Fair.</l>
<l>And can you long resist, the sweet Temptation,</l>
<l>Give us at least a Bill of Reformation.</l>
<l>That the succeeding Age may say of you,</l>
<l>You dare be Civil, tho' you can't be true.</l>
<l>But if at last no Charms have power to win-ye,</l>
<l>You're past Repentance—or the Devil's in-ye.</l>

<p>OH! Sir <hi>William,</hi> I am so transported, I cannot speak in the common strain of Mankind.</p>

<p> And prethy, <hi>Bellair,</hi> What occasions this Transport?</p>

<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>What Visions! Aparitions?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Cou'd I but hope to see her once more, I'd change the happiest half of my Life for that one moment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>If you please to descend from your high flown Raptures, and walk hand in hand with my Understanding.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>You'l lead me to her. <stage>(hastily.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, what, before I know where she is—you wou'd be landed at your Port before you have taken Shipping, or told the place you design for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Pho; you know all my Designs.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Are Extravagant—you have more Intreagues upon your Hands, than a handsom young Poet on the success of his first Play—like a Dog in a Herd, you run at all, and catch none, because you run with such ungovern'd Heat, you spring the Quarry before you can draw your Net.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>But if I miss Sitting, I commonly hit 'em Flying—but this is nothing to the purpose; the Lady, Man, the Lady—.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Ay, the Lady; what of her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Which I saw last Night—Oh, such a Creature!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>At what Window?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Such a Charming Air.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>What House was it at?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>As much Youth as wou'd serve to recover half the decay'd Faces in the Town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>What Street?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Wanton as a Nun, yet look'd demure as a Quaker—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Z'death, where, where, is this rare Creature to be seen?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Then her Features, Sir <hi>William!</hi> Oh, such Features; she is the most perfect Piece in the World—her shape clean and easy—a profuse quantity of dark brown Hair—and such a Complexion, as the Gods form when they design a Miracle of Beauty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Nay, since you will have your own way, I'll strike in with you—a charming high Forehead.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Ay, and such a Mouth—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Sparkling Black Eyes—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>And such a Cast—</p>

<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Ah, he's got above the Clouds already—when you have recover'd your Senses, <hi>Bellair,</hi> you may be fit for Conversation; I have a little business to dispatch—and must beg your Pardon.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Thou wilt not leave me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Why, what Service can I do you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>You must assist me in the Management of this Affair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>What Affair? Who is she? Where did you see her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Why, when I left you last Night, I took a Boat resolving to go up the River for a little Air, when the luckiest occasion presented to make me the happiest Man living.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>I have known a hundred of these lucky Occasions; in a Months time the most unlucky Occasions, that ever Man had. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>What was it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>A Lady designing to Land at <hi>White-Hall</hi> Stairs, stepping short from the Boat, fell into the Water, I jumpt in after her, caught her in my Arms, and brought her safe a-shoar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Who cou'd have believ'd he shou'd be burnt in the middle of the <hi>Thames</hi> now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>What's her Name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>I know not, she enquir'd mine, and where I liv'd; gave me a thousand Thanks, and promis'd I shou'd hear from her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Well, and what can I do for you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you, I must have Lodgings in this House, for here I directed her; told her my Name was <hi>Constant,</hi> tho', faith, <hi>Bellair</hi> was at my Tongues end; but you know my Reasons for concealing my Name, least my Father hear I'm in <hi>England,</hi> before I'd have him, and force me to marry the Woman he commanded me Home for, which, for ought I know, may be Ugly, Old, Ill-natur'd, Foolish, Conceited, Vain, and so forth—at least, I shall think
<pb n="4" facs="12"/>
her such, because of his chusing—I like no Caterer in Love's Market—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>You shall have these Lodgings to oblige you, good Mr. <hi>Constant—</hi>but what have you done with the other Lady you told me of yesterday; you was then dying for her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Faith, I like her still—but t'other, t'other, is a perfect Venus—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, what is your Name to her? I shall certainly forget all these Names—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Colonel <hi>Revel,</hi> you Sot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Just come from where, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>From <hi>Portugal,</hi> Blockhead.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>And—are you an—Officer too in t'other Place with your new Amour; Co, co, co, con, pray, Sir, do me the favour to tell me your Name to this Incognita once more?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p><hi>Constant,</hi> Coxcomb.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>And what are you, Sir, pray, what are you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>An <hi>Oxfordshire</hi> Gentleman; remember that, Sirrah, come up to Town about a Law-Suit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir—Colonel <hi>Revell</hi> just come from <hi>Portugal—</hi>Mr. <hi>Constant,</hi> an <hi>Oxfordshire</hi> Gentleman, come up about a Law-Suit—Very well, I have it now, Sir, I warrant you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Well, but do you think to manage both these Intreagues with Secrecy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>I do; and in order to't, I'll keep my own Lodgings, that are known to the other, and these for my Incognita, and I'll engage to play my part with both.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>To what purpose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Why, since my old Dad will have me Marry, I would willingly chuse for my self; now, you must know, I design to take my swing of Love and Liberty—if, in the chase, I chance to meet one that can fix me, her I'll Marry; till when I'll, like the Bee, kiss every Plant, and gather sweatness from every Flower—Youth is the Harvest of our Lives, Sir <hi>William.</hi></p>

<p>Well, in my Conscience, Travel has given thee a large Assurance.</p>

<p>The Projecting Coxcomb, I told you of Yesterday.</p>

<p>What, he that Mimicks thee in his Cloaths?</p>

<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Mr. <hi>Wou'dbe—</hi>spare me, I beseech you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>My Soul's inhabited; or, rather Canoniz'd, with an Alacrity to see you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>I know not how his Soul's inhabited; but his Head might pass for a Colony, in <hi>Greenland,</hi> it is so thinly Peopled. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>

<stage>Enter <hi>Ned, Free-Love.</hi></stage>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>What Gentleman was that I saw go out just now?</p>

<p>A Friend of mine, who, for some reasons, I have promis'd this Appartment to; I hope Sir <hi>Paul</hi> won't be

alarm'd; I think 'tis best not to let him know it, if he does not find it out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>Much the best, for he'l ask so many impertinent Questions about him, and be in such a fright; he'l call in half the Parish to watch with him—Who is the Gentleman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>If you remember, I told you, when I was in <hi>Spain,</hi> a Gentleman rescu'd me from the hands of Ruffians, when I was set upon in the Night; this is he, and ever since we have held a strickt Friendship—Perhaps he may have kill'd his Man, I know not; he desires privacy—and I am bound, in honour, to give it.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>Doubtless—What's his Name?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>But, Sir <hi>William,</hi> pray, how do you like my Way of greeting—I never want Words, you see—I hate those dull Rogues, that have no better Expressions at meeting their Friends than, dear <hi>Jack,</hi> how is't?

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Is it not too short, Mr. <hi>Measure?</hi> <stage>(To the Taylor.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>Not at all, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>The Suit my Taylor is making, is the very same Colour; I'll send, and have it Trim'd exactly like that. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>How do you like my fancy in this Suit, Mr. <hi>Wou'dbe?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Sir <hi>William,</hi> I reverence the sublimity of your Fancy—If mine be not done by Play-time, I'll break my Tayler's Head, and never pay the Bill. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>

<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>But what new Discoveries have you made lately, Mr. <hi>Wou'dbe?</hi> Never a Project, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, I am going to erect an Office for Poetry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>How! An Office for Poetry?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir, where all Poets may have free access, paying such a moiety of their Profits, and be furnish'd with all sorts of Refin'd Words adapted to their several Characters.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>The Poets will be very much oblig'd to you truly, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>I think so—hark ye, I'm upon another Project, which you'll not guess for a Wager?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>No, really, Mr. <hi>Wou'dbe;</hi> 'tis not in my shallow Capacity, to fathom the profundity of your Wit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir <hi>William,</hi> such accumulated Kindness will Bankrupt my poor Acknowledgments—profundity of your Wit—spoke like a Gentleman, and a Scholar—thou art expensively obliging, therefore I will Communicate—tho' it is not grown to a full Maturity, yet—'tis this—for the good of the Publick, I am contriving how to save the charges of Hackney-Coaches; the Rascals are so saucy, especially to Ladies, there's no enduring them; I resolve to destroy their Constitution.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>As how, prethee?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>They are the most necessary things in the World; a Hackney-Coach carries us from one end of the Town to the other in a trice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir <hi>William—</hi>but my Project carries 'em quicker—and without go, ng out of their Houses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>That's a Stratagem, indeed, beyond my Comprehension.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>If you can do that, Mr. <hi>Wou'dbe,</hi> you need not fear a Patent; the Ladies will be all of your side.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>They will have reason, Sir, for they may Dress, Patch, Paint, drink Tea, or play at Piquet, all the while they are going to the Play-house—Is not this an excellent Project?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Excellent, indeed; but, prethee, how is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, how is it, you must deal with the Devil certainly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>No, without his help, I assure you, 'tis all my own—this individual Brain contriv'd it—were I known at Court, I shou'd be a great Man—a most magnificent Man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Oh, this Project, Sir, will do your business.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>I know you are impatient for the Secret; you are my Friends, or I'd not impart a matter of this Consequence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>I hope you don't doubt our secrecy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Not in the least—to convince you, 'tis this, I'll make the Streets to move.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, the Streets move! Prethee, how will thou do that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Oh, by Clock-Work, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>By Clock-Work? What, make the solid Earth move by Clock-Work?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir—I affirm that's possible—You mistake, the Earth is not solid; read but <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chronicle, and you'll find a whole Field walk'd ten mile in Queen <hi>Bess</hi>'s days.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>But not by Clock-Work, Mr <hi>Wou'dbe.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Humph—ha—I can't be positive in that, but—if it can walk at all—why can't it be made walk by Clock-work—but in a Months time I shall be able to answer that, and all other Objections—For, you must know, Yesterday I began my Study, in order to search out the Curiosity of every Country, Language, Art and Science—you shall hear how I have Canton'd out the Day—I rise about Five. my first hour is laid out upon Law—'tis fit a Gentleman shou'd understand the Laws of his Country, tho' I hate the confounded Study, 'tis so crabbed—At Six. I read a Lesson of Greek—at Seven, one of Hebrew—Eight, is for Italian—Nine, for Spanish—Ten,
<pb n="9" facs="17" ana="y"/>
for French—Eleven Astronomy—Twelve is proper for Geography, then the Sun Beams are perpendicular—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>Excellent, ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>At One I Dine—then Repose an Hour, for Digestion—at Three I Study Physick—that, if I'm Poison'd by the Vintners, I may not be kill'd by the Doctors—at Four Logick—at Five Phylosophy—at Six Husbandry—that when my Father dies, my Steward, and Tenants, may't cheat me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>A Politick thought—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Hawking, Hunting, Fishing, Fowling, at Seven—Architecture at Eight—for to understand the Art of Building, is of mighty consequence towards raising of a Man's Fortune, you know—Nine for Poetry, in honour of the Nine Muses—because I love the Ladies Company towards Bed-time—Thus, in a Month, I hope to become Master of all these things; how like you my Rules, Gentlemen, ha?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>Oh, wonderfully, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Well, Poetry is one of the noblest Parts of the Mathematicks—but we have such Factions now on foot, that Musick has put Poetry quite out of Tune—but that Suit—I must to my Taylor immediately— <stage>(aside.</stage></p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Not I, upon my Soul—but does the Town really say so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>Why shou'd I tell you so else?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Nay, the Elegance of my Fabrick, has Titulated the Imagination of many a fine Lady, I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, the Fool believes you.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>I believe that, but I'll give him enough on't if he is—'tis the most Whimsical Coxcomb I ever saw—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>Well, but how goes it between you and <hi>Beliza,</hi> Brother?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>I begin to doubt a Rival there, but who, I can't find out—She is grown indifferent of late, often abroad, and seldom in humour, when at home; if there be a Favourite in reserve, let her take care to conceal him, for, Faith, I have suck'd in the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s Jealousy with their Air, and shou'd breath a Vain without scruple—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>Well, if ever I be in Love—of all Passions which agitate the mind of Man—grant I may never be infected with Jealousy.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>How sober he looks—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>This is the Friend I refer you to, Mr. <hi>Constant.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="17" facs="25"/>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p><hi>Constant!—</hi>Yes, he is <hi>Constant</hi> with a Witness.</p>
</sp>

<p>What she promises I'll confirm.</p>
<stage>(Exit.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>I'm in a hopeful way, faith—egad, I am so confounded, I know not how to look—but I'm resolv'd to carry it off, and perswade her I'm not the Man. <stage>(aside.)</stage> Madam, I'm oblig'd to my Stars, however, tho' they conceal the Family, and Name of her I adore, they give me an opportunity of knowing her second self, you being made so by the strictest bonds of Friendship—this is the hardest task I ever went thro', by <hi>Jupiter.</hi> <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>I don't wonder that you know me—but I am surpriz'd at your Impudence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>This is the first time I was ever accus'd of that by a fair Lady; Wherein have I incurr'd your displeasure?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, do you act this part upon a Wager, or do you think I have lost my Senses—very pritty, truly—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>A Wager—Part—and Senses—What do you mean, Madam?—Oh, mischievous encounter. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Colonel <hi>Revel</hi> can inform Mr. <hi>Constant</hi> of my meaning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Colonel <hi>Revell!</hi> who's he?—a Pox of the Name. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>So, he don't know himself—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>You don't know such a Man, as Colonel <hi>Revell▪</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Not I, upon my word, Madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Well, such an Assurance, I never saw, and do you think this will pass upon me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>I hope so, <stage>(aside.)</stage> I protest, Madam, I can't guess what you aim at—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>Were I in your place, Madam, I'd have him tost in a Blanket.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Well said, Mrs. <hi>Patch;</hi> egad, wou'd I were well out of their hands. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Look ye, Sir, your Declaration for my Cousin concerns me not; sor, from the first, to me you appear'd as indifferent as now—But if you think to impose upon my Understanding, you'l draw my utmost Malice on your Head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="18" facs="26"/>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>And I need no more—for the malice of a Woman, exceeds the Devils; <stage>(aside.)</stage> Your Rallery is very pleasant, Madam; but very different from what I expected—for, I confess, I am a Stranger to your meaning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you shift your Shape so often, you may easily forget—an excellent Contrivance, to take as many Names, as you make Mistress's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>Consult your Pocket-Book, Sir; and you'l find your Name was, <hi>Revell,</hi> two hours ago—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>This is a new way of Treating Strangers, Madam; do you call this, telling me the Secrets of the Unknown Fair; this will make the prittiest Novel, in the World— <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>The Secrets of the Unknown Fair; yes, She shall know your Secrets, I'll promise you, and who you are—believe me, your Affairs are done with her; you shall neither know her Name, nor Quality.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Recal that Sentence, Madam; Or, let me fall a Sacrifice, to your supposed Resentments—never to know my Lovely, Dear Incognita, is Death, with all the additional Racks <hi>Barbarians</hi> e're invented, to separate Soul and Body. I begin to grow perfect in my double Art, I find. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>This is the most Bare-fac'd Impostor I ever saw. <stage>(aside.)</stage> Really now, in my opinion, Colonel, you act the same Person too long—come, come, pull off the Masque, and I'll forgive you, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>That wheedle shan't take, I'm in, and must go thro' it, <stage>(aside)</stage> Mask, Madam! by all the pangs of Love I feel for your Beauteous Friend, I wou'd wear no disguise to any thing that belongs to her—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>Well, was I my Lady, I'd have that Tongue pull'd out of your Head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Madam, who is that pritty Enemy; is she Friend, or some Relation?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>Do, do, seem Ignorant, poor Devil—you don't know me; not long since, you knew me for this Lady's Maid, and lik'd me well enough, to think me worth a Compliment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="19" facs="27"/>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Make Love to my Woman! Pray, Sir, what Name wou'd you have taken to her, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>You are in a pleasant humour, Ladies; I hope I shall find the benefit of it; to my knowledge, I never saw any of you, till this hour—This is a Master-piece of Art, to face down two Women at once. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if I had believ'd all he said to me, I shou'd have Registred him amongst my Lovers. That is not true, neither?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>As the rest—Poor, Gentlewoman, I pitty thee; prithy get Advice, before thy Frenzy increase too much.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>So, you'l perswade us we are Mad, by and by—and you don't bear a Colonel's Commission, and have not been in <hi>Portugal</hi> with <hi>Charles</hi> the Third?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>No, upon my honour, Madam—My Name is, <hi>Constant,</hi> born in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> and come up about a Suit in <hi>Chancery;</hi> and know this Colonel no more, than you know me; if you please, I'll give you my Oath on't—which I can do without Perjury, that's my Comfort. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>A pleasant quibble, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>This Story has cost you some Pains—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>I wish I cou'd see this Gentleman which you take me for; can you believe I cou'd be so base to make Love to another, if once I had presum'd to mention it to you—your Charms are full security against such Proceedings; I am concern'd, that Nature has made any resemblance between us; I shall hate my self for being like him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Well, whether you will, or you will not be him, it is the same thing—provided you'l tell him, that I suffer'd his Addresses only for my Diversion, and that I never had any Passion for him, but loath, detest and hate him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Tell him—where shall I find him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>I have done, and desire you'd know your way out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>I wou'd not willingly disobey a Lady; but here, Madam, you must pardon me, since my future good or ill depends on you; I cannot stir from hence till I obtain your promise to assist my Suit, and give me hopes that I, at last, may know my Beauteous Fair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20" facs="28"/>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, all that I can say, Colonel, is, that you are very unlucky in this Affair, not but you Counterfeit to a Miracle; but the Mischief is, that I have all my Senses, can see Colonel <hi>Revel,</hi> hear Colonel <hi>Revel,</hi> and understand Colonel <hi>Revel,</hi> too well to solicit his Cause, I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>There's your Answer, Sir,—and if you please to follow me, I'll shew you a way out better known to you than that you came in by.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Pray, good Mrs. <hi>Civility,</hi> be not so hasty—give me leave, at least, to see your Cousin before I go, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>To what end, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>To convince you of your Error.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>That's the hardest task that you ever undertook, Colonel, and not to be effected; therefore, once more I tell you, you have seen your last of her, and your absence wou'd oblige me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>'Tis very hard, Madam, that because nature has made me resemble another Person, who may, for ought I know, be a Man of Honour too, tho' unhappily under your Displeasure, I shou'd have the ill Fortune to suffer for Nature's Fault.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>That wou'd, indeed, be unjust—but I shall not be prevail'd upon to believe Nature in the fault here; therefore, pray retire, the Scene is long enough, 'tis time to change it; good Colonel, don't oblige one to treat you below your Title.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>Don't you understand my Lady, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, Madam, but too well; and if I must go without the satisfaction I expected, let me implore this favour, tell her, I dye hers.</p>
<stage>(Exit.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>And every bodies, I dare swear, in his turn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>This Man, is the very Epitome of his Sex; the compleatest Jugler I ever saw; I protest, his Assurance has put me quite out of Countenance.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Re-enter <hi>Camila.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Well, how do you like him, Cousin; is he not a Charming Fellow?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="21" facs="29"/>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>I think not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Pish! I know you do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, I don't; and if you knew as much as I, you wou'd think him as ugly as I do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Ugly! Can any mortal think that Man ugly? But, prithy, what have you discover'd—wou'nt you tell me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Yes, if you promise to make right use on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>That your pretended Lover is a Villain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>How! Pray, Cousin, Explain your Self within the Rules of good Manners.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>He deserves it not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>I don't understand you—and the Introduction grows tedious—of what do you accuse Mr. <hi>Constant.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>In the first place, his Name is not <hi>Constant,</hi> but <hi>Revel.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>How know you that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>From his own Mouth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>When?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>A Week ago.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Where?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Here in this House.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>In this House, how came he hither?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Upon his Legs, I think.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>On what Business, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Much upon the same Errand—Love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Love! To whom?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>To your Friend and Servant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, now I find your Drift—you like him your self, and this is an Artifice to blast my good Opinion—'tis poorly done, <hi>Beliza.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>No, my Constitution is not so warm as yours—remember you took Fire in the middle of Water; I dispise him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>We never dispise indifferent things—I little expected this from a Friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>If you'd have the Friend continu'd, don't provoke me to return suspicions, Cousin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Don't you provoke me, by traducing of the Man I love—he has not been in Town two days, and you'd persuade
<pb n="22" facs="30"/>
me he has made Overtures of Love to you a Week ago.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>If I don't prove this is Colonel <hi>Revel,</hi> lately come from <hi>Portugal,</hi> and been in Town this Fortnight, and made me several Visits under pretence of Courtship <hi>A-la-mode,</hi> I'm content to forfeit both Friendship and Estate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>How shall it be prov'd? 'Tis sure impossible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Write to him, and tell him what I have Confirm'd; desire him to come hither to Justify himself, if he expects any farther Favours from you—at the same time I'll send for him by the Name of <hi>Revel,</hi> and appoint him here also, if there appear two Men exactly the same, (as I am sure they are) then I'll own my self in the Wrong, and ask your Pardon; if not, you shall mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Agreed, I'll in and write to him this moment; pray, Heaven, there be two Socia's.</p>

<p>That's more than I am, I assure you, Sir <hi>William.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>To find you alone, I meant, Madam; I am not surpriz'd at your being out of Humour, for I have seldom found you in it of late, the reason of which I'm yet to learn, not being Conscious of having given you any Cause, except the truest Passion that e'er possess'd the Heart of Man be one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Sometimes, and in some Persons it is so; but from whence you derive your suspitions, I can't imagine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>From your excessive coldness—for some days past, I have beheld such a reserve in all your Carriage to me, very different from what it us'd to be, and I begun to fear your Heart had entertain'd some new Amour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>I hope he has not discover'd this Impostor, he could not meet him, sure. <stage>(aside.)</stage> you have no reason to doubt my Sincerity, Sir <hi>William;</hi> I'm not Subject to fall in Love, I may venture to say, you hold the greatest share in my Heart.</p>
</sp>

<p>That's kind—but this thin airy Dyet of Hope and Expectation, <hi>Beliza,</hi> starve those which feed on't—will

Misfortunes, by making my Confinement stricter, under pretence of the Honour of our Family—I hope I'm of Age to know how far that concerns me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sister, but the Wife that is displeas'd with the Husband—and the Husband that does not please the Wife, are always in Danger—she of liking some body else—and he of being a Cuckold—now, while there is such a probability, the Honour of our Family requires a Guard.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>Yes, and I know 'em too—Sir <hi>Paul</hi> took me without a Fortune, by which yours is the greater, yet the consideration has no weight with you; it pleases you to see your Sister Condemn'd to the idle Fancies, and whimsical Mistrusts, of this impertinent Doatard; he is so apprehensive of Death, that he allows a Surgeon a Hundred a Year perpetually to attend him, and wou'd not set a step without him for a Thousand—nay, he lyes in the same Chamber—just now he fancied himself call'd three times, which he takes for an <hi>Omen</hi> of his Death, pray Heaven it prove so—and has sent for Twenty People to watch by him.</p>

<p>Ridiculous folly—but you must bear with it, Sister; he is Old—</p>

<p>Is it a Crime. to ask who is in my own House?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Yes, if they are not in your own Appartment—'tis not Modesty in your Sex to inquire after ours—now I foresee my Error too late, in letting him have these Lodgings—How came you to know there was a Man here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I must not say, I have seen him— <stage>(aside)</stage> my Woman brought me word, there was a Stranger dresing himself, when I sent her this Morning, to ask if you wou'd not drink some Chocolate with me.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>You shall know in time—I shall want thy personal appearance too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>You shall want nothing, in my power—but prithy, do you like either of 'em well enough to Marry?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>In my Conscience I think I cou'd be content with the Noose, if my Incognita's Family be answerable to her beauty—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if he grows honourably in Love, I may hope for some rest at last. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Why will ye not quit the other then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>T'other is Related, and a Friend—if I deceive her not, she'l maliciously spoil my intreague; besides, 'tis a pritty Amusement, and the design so Novel, that I must pursue it for the pleasure of Invention, and I think it possible to persorm; we have seen two People so very like, that when absent they cou'd not be distinguish'd from one another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>But if the Faces wore Resemblance, the Voice Shape discover'd it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>But a good Assurance solves all that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, if the worst come to the worst—that they will both have you—why en'e marry them both, keep one for your self, and t'other to entertain your Friends—or, if you please, Sir,—to do you a Service, I don't care if I take one of 'em off your hands,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Then you'l venture to rely upon your Master's choice, ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir, sooner than ever a Man in <hi>England;</hi> my Master, has tasted so many of those Dishes—that I dare must to his Palate.</p>

<p>This is a Gentleman of an intellectual Sublimity—No, Sir, I contemn the Terrene extraction of those poor Animals, whose Barren-Intellects thrusts such spurious Brats abroad; when I write, it shall be all my own, I assure you.</p>

<p>That I must consider on, Sir; too many things at once destroy the Thought, and dull the Fancy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>But suppose it shou'd not live till the third Day, the Town is very Capricious.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>I know it, Sir, for that reason, I took this method; when their Gold is at stake, they'l bring in their Bodies, to save their Bail—egad, I shan't have Money enough—Let me see—I'll sell these Cloths, to make it up—Gentlemen, I'm your most Oblig'd—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>He's just gon out, Madam, he's a happy Man, to have so much Beauty in quest of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>Beauty's an Epithet your Sex never fail to make use of to raise our Vanity, when present, but the Object once remov'd, you soon recal your Praises.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Sometimes, Madam, good Manners produce Adulation; but here Flattery dares not show her Face, your Charms are so conspicuous, they need no Art to inform your Knowledge, nor I no Cunning to inslave my self; I am Chain'd already, your Eyes at first sight reduc'd me, and the short moments which we pass'd this day together, made such an Impression on my Heart, that I have thought of nothing since but how to see you again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>Oh! How his Words run thro' my Soul—alass, Sir, to what purpose shou'd you see me, I am Married.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>The Crime be on their Heads that forc'd your Marriage, Nature ne'er design'd these Charms shou'd wither in the Arms of Age, and destin'd only to a Clod—besides your not consenting to the Match, makes it invalid, and of no force to hold you—take pity, then, both of yourself and me, I languish, sigh, dispair—nay, e'en die for you.</p>

<p>Forbid that Thought, I cannot see you die—yet must not yield; let me go for Virtues sake—</p>

<p>Love forbids it—Oh! I shall faint with Extacy of Pleasure—no Jessemin nor Rose has half the sweets that dwell upon these Lips, 'tis Essence from the Throne of <hi>Jove—</hi>this Neck, this Breast—Oh! every part about thee is Celestial, Loadstone like, thy Breath attracts and draws my Lips to thine. <stage>(kissing her.)</stage></p>

<p>That's ever the Women's Question—ask not that; can I prove false to so much Beauty, oh, no, faithful as the Needle to its Pole, or Turtle to his Mate, secret as a Priest—and loving as the Vine—give me Possession once, and bind the truest of his Sex for ever— <stage>(pulling her.)</stage></p>

<p>'Tis my way—but I know Truth is an out-of-fashon'd Courtship, which your Sex is not us'd too. Ha! my Master. <stage>(Enter <hi>Bellair</hi> drest for <hi>Revel.</hi>)</stage> Sir, I did your Message.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>My Message, Fellow, what Message? This Dog will spoil all by his blunders; he do's not see that I'm <hi>Revel</hi> now; <stage>(aside.)</stage> do you know who you speak too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>By my troth, I don't know—and yet methinks I shou'd know too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>'Tis very strange if he shou'd not know his Master.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, pray are not you my Master, co, co, co.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you, Rascal. <stage>(Strikes him a box on the Ear.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Egad, I'm in the wrong, but where I can't tell—his Fingers are grown plaguy Flippant of late.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Is <hi>Beliza</hi> within, my Dear, dost know?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>I believe she is, Sir—I'll let her know you'd speak with her, if you please to signify what Name you'l wear at present—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Name! Why, my own Name, Child, <hi>Revel;</hi> what Name shou'd I wear? Thou art pleasant, ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>There was my mistake, now. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>

<p>Here she comes, Sir.</p>
<stage>(Enter <hi>Beliza.</hi>)</stage>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Hold, Sir! Who are you, pray? The Colonel, or the Country Gentleman—the Grave, Serious, formal Lover,
<pb n="36" facs="44"/>
or the Gay Rakish Soldier?—let me know, I beseech you, that I may square my Conversation to yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Ha▪ ha, ha, Why these Interrogatories? Madam, do you walk in your Sleep?—now I fancy you are in a Dream; ay, it is so, faith—and I cannot resist the Opportunity for Gloves. <stage>(Kisses her.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Away, thou exquisite Dissembler—How can you look me in the Face.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Because I don't know a Face in <hi>Europe</hi> that pleases me half so well—but prithy, why this Air of indifference, or rather, resentment? Look ye, Madam, if you affect this Quarrel by the way of Poignant Sauce—you have no need of those little recourses of your Sex<hi>—Revel</hi> Loves as much as ever, and dare promise—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>More than you perform.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Accuse me not before you try me—but why these Cross Purposes—ha, my Incognita! now <hi>Bellair,</hi> play thy part <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
<stage>(Enter <hi>Camila.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Here's one will inform you.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Mr. <hi>Constant,</hi> are you come?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p><hi>Constant!</hi> yes, faith, Madam, I'm as constant as any Man—this Lady can witness for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Not in the Court of Conscience, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Then you have no Conscience at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>If my Master took up lying by the Week, what a Confounded Interest 'twou'd come to in a Year. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Do you know why I sent for you so soon, Mr. <hi>Constant.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>No, Madam—nor that you-sent for me at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>You mistake, Cousin, this is Colonel <hi>Revel,</hi> ha, ha▪</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Colonel fiddle, is it not?—sure I know Mr <hi>Constant.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p><hi>Constant!</hi> Who is he, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Who's he? Why, are not you he?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Not that I know off.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, you shall be <hi>Revel,</hi> Sir, till <hi>Constant</hi> comes, if my Cousin will give you leave—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>I'm surpriz'd at his Impudence—pray, were not you here two Hours ago, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Not that I remember—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="37" facs="45"/>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Impossible—did not you save me from drowning, Yesterday.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>'Twas in my sleep, then—for waking I am sure I did not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Distraction—Nor is not your Name <hi>Constant?</hi> And <hi>Oxfordshire.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Quite wrong—this is a pretty <hi>Christmas</hi> Game Lady—but, pray let me have some Commands, as well as all Questions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Nor you don't know this Footman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Agen—No, Madam, never scaw him in my Life.</p>

<p>Oh Lord, Oh Lord, who am I now—sor he has renounc'd me heartily. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>What say you, Friend, don't you know this Gentleman neither?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>No more than I do the great <hi>Mogul;</hi> Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Who do you belong to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Belong to, Madam! why, why, why, a pox of his 'tother Name, now I can't think on't, if I were to be hang'd. <stage>(aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Ay, who do you belong to, I say, again?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Why, I belong to my Master, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>And what is that Master's Name, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Name, Madam—his Name is—ad, now I think on't, I won't tell his Name—why, sure I'm too big to be Catechiz'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>This Dog will betray me. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>You challeng'd this for your Master, just now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>What if I did, Mistress, what then? He is not, it seems, without his being double, as you pretend—the Devil shou'd have doubled me too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>What business have you here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Business! why I brought a Message from my Master to one of you—and so good by—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Hold, stay, Sir—pray, what was that Message?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Why, that my Master wou'd be here, presently—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I suppose, this is Mr. <hi>Constant</hi>'s Man, that you mistake me for—ah, pox of his Memory. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="38" facs="46"/>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>You have hit it, Sir—Mr. <hi>Constant</hi> is my Master, now his Name's out—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>I'm astonish'd! Cousin, did you ever hear the like?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Yes, the very same—but I traduc'd Mr. <hi>Constant</hi> then, you know—What say you, <hi>Revel,</hi> did I?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Hey, Ladies! do you design to bait me, if so, give me fair play, at least—harkye, draw off your Cousin, and confess your Plot—or egad I'll humour her Frenzy, take the Name of <hi>Constant,</hi> and make Love to her before your Face.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Withal my heart, 'tis not the first time—and I have no further Services for you, ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>So, he's in a fair way to loose 'em both <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Messenger and Attendant.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mess.</speaker>
<p>I Arrest you, Sir, in an Action of High Treason.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Treason, Sir! Sure you mistake the Man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Ha! how's this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mess.</speaker>
<p>Your Name's <hi>Revel,</hi> Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>My Name is <hi>Revel,</hi> Sir, but guilty of no such Crime.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Here's a turn now—I must second him. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mess.</speaker>
<p>That must be prov'd, 'tis no business of mine, I am only to Execute my Orders.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>I am concern'd for him, methinks—won't you take Bail, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mess.</speaker>
<p>In these cases no Bail is admitted, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>My Mind misgives me, this is a Trick.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mess.</speaker>
<p>Come, Sir, I can't stay—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Hold, hold, Sir, pray Enter my Action too, for a Box of the Ear he gave me just now—this is some comfort, however, I shall see him hang'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Come, Gentlemen, I can easily prove my Innocence—if I stand fair in this Lady's Opinion, I cannot fear the World. <stage>(to <hi>Beliza.</hi>)</stage></p>
<stage>(Exit. with Messengers.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>I wish you a good Deliverance, Colonel—I know not what to think.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>I'll see him lodg'd, I'm resolv'd.</p>
<stage>(Exit.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Nor I—to what end can a Man affect these Disguises?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="39" facs="47"/>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Out of Gallantry, Cousin—I shall hardly be convinc'd without I saw them both together—I pitty the Colonel's Unhappy Disgrace; but, believe me, now he is Arrested, <hi>Constant</hi> is no more, his Man following him plainly shew'd the Cheat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I confess they are extreamly alike, but observing very narrowly, I think their Features are not exactly the same.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>You are of my mind, Madam—for methinks, he is half an Inch taller than Mr. <hi>Constant.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>And something about his Face, I don't know what—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>I fancy his Nose is something longer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Thou hast hit it; it is his Nose, I'm sure.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Bellair</hi> for <hi>Constant.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliza.</speaker>
<p>You are both mad I'm sure—ha, ha, ha,—bless me! Pray, Heaven it ben't the Devil that thus deludes us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>I am come, Madam, according to your Commands—but if my Reception now prove like the last, the pleasure of seeing you, will much abate—I am first at the Rendezvous, I perceive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Now, Cousin, you are convinc'd, I hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>You are, I see.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Now, Madam, I can tell you the very difference, his Eyes are a little-little larger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I think they are a great deal larger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Why do you Survey me so, Madam? is it possible, that you can be deceiv'd too—Where is this Colonel to be found? Will he not come?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>He is just gone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>He has Disingag'd himself, Sir, to leave you room, to Act your part.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Why did not you keep him, I sent my Man before me, to let you know, I would instantly be here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>How could we, when the Queen's Authority favour'd his Retreat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>How say you, Madam? has the Queen sent for him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="40" facs="48"/>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>How cunningly you Dissemble—but that's not new, Dissimulation, seems your natural gift.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Still these Reproaches, will nothing, that I say convince you?—Why did you consent to let him go?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Why, do you really think this is still the same? <stage>(to <hi>Beliza.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>I do really—the Trap was laid with too much Policy to be prevented, knowing the Messenger I never suspected the truth of the Action—but I may change to Counter Plot you yet</p>
<stage>(Exit.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>So, she is gone to the Prison—but she'l return as unsatisfied as she went <stage>(aside.)</stage> Why do you take pleasure to insult the Man, your Beauty has inslav'd? If my Visits be offensive—tho' I die without you—I prefer your Peace so much above my own, I'll never disturb you with my Presence more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>He looks, methinks, with such an honest Face, it can be only <hi>Constant;</hi> <stage>(aside.)</stage> you must own, I have reason to suspect you—but you have a powerful Advocate within, which Pleads in your excuse, and fain wou'd Justifie you.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Robin.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>At last, I am satisfied—the Spark is Cag'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Did you follow him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Do you doubt it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Whom, speak?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, are you there?—you'l be hang'd in Effigie to morrow—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>How, Sause-box!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir, he did Box me, but I shall have a swinging Revenge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Revenge, for what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, your likeness—that here has been such a sputter about—is taken up for Treason, Murder, Robbery, and the Devil and all—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Oh, misfortune! to be like such a Rascal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Ay, so it is indeed, Sir—I thought he wou'd have been pull'd to pieces in the Street—there were Girls of Fourteen,
<pb n="41" facs="49"/>
and Women of Fourscore, with Actions of Ravishment against him—and Tavern, and Eating-house Bills in abundance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>The Rogue has improv'd the hint admirably <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>'Tis an illbred Scroundrel, he is very like you, Sir, that's the truth on't,) he gave me the damndest Box on the Ear, only because I mistook him for you—he has a swinging Fist, Sir, that was all the Distinction I cou'd make between you—but I shall see him truss'd up for it, that's my comfort.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>I am extreamly pleas'd to find they are two different Persons—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p><hi>Constant!</hi> I can't believe my Eyes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Why, what surprises thee?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>I met thy very Likeness in Custody of a Messenger, and stop'd 'em to examin the reason—the Spark snapt me up short, and told me 'twas none of my business, bad 'em pass on—I admir'd at the meaning, for I cou'd have sworn it had been thee—ha! that is <hi>Beliza</hi>'s Lodgings, certainly. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Were he Drest like me too?</p>

<p>No, that was the only Distinction I found about him—I wish <hi>Beliza</hi> ben't the other Woman—</p>

<p>Now, Madam—are you still in suspence?</p>

<p>If it be so, 'tis some pleasure at least to know the Man. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>

<p>What do I hear? Oh, Madam, if ever pity touch'd your Soul, exert it now—think where you are going, think
<pb n="42" facs="50"/>
too, who you leave—give me some assurance to support my hope, that you will disobey your Father—or, I am miserable.</p>
</sp>

<p>That's all I ask—unexpected turn of ill Fortune▪ this News has chang'd the very Countenance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Why, one wou'd swear thou wer't really in Love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>And not be forsworn, Sir <hi>William;</hi> for, faith, I do love her heartily, and am ready to Capitulate for better for worse, as soon as she pleases.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>I'm glad to hear that—one thing, pray, tell me, without reserve—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Most willingly—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>What design have you upon the other; for you can't marry 'em both?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Humph—faith, no design at all, if I cou'd come off handsomely; tho' she's very pritty, but too well acquainted with my Incognita, to have any Intrigue with.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Does she love you <hi>Bellair?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Not that ever I cou'd discover, to say the Truth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>One thing more—is not her Name <hi>Beliza!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Ha! does he know her—I'm afraid my Plot's spoil'd again. <stage>(aside.)</stage> Nay, Sir <hi>William,</hi> don't force me to tell Names, especially after the Stratagem I have made use of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, I am convinc'd 'tis the same; had I apprehended it sooner, Friend, you had not carried your design thus far.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>So, I have made my Rival, my Confident; I find I am a lucky Fellow, now, may he, out of pure Revenge discover me <stage>(aside.)</stage> If I have committed any fault; Sir <hi>William,</hi> 'twas a fault of Ignorance; could I devine the Lady was your Acquaintance—so that I am assur'd your Friendship must forgive me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>What Friendship must forgive, Love denies—as I imagin'd, here she comes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="43" facs="51"/>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir <hi>William,</hi> whatever satisfaction you demand I'm ready to return—this favour let me obtain, as you are a Gentleman betray me not, to my fair Unknown—this is the most unfortunate thing.</p>
<stage>(Exit.)</stage>

<stage>(exit.)</stage>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Beliza.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>I am confounded! I know not whether there be two or not—the Messenger affirms that <hi>Revell</hi> is in his Custody, but his Orders run so strickt, that none must be admitted to see him—ha, <hi>Sir William.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Pray, what was the Subject of your Ladyship's Comtemplation—Colonel <hi>Revell.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>He has found it then at last—why, do you know Colonel <hi>Revell,</hi> Sir <hi>William?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>You do, I find—persidious Woman—have I discovered thy falshood—all thy turnings and windings of indifference, had their source from hence.</p>

<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>What was that prithy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>The Box o'th' Ear, Sir; 'twas very uncomfortable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>On, there's a Cordial for thee. <stage>(Gives him Money)</stage> 'twas only to teach you a good Decorum.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, your humble Servant, I am ready to be taught, Sir, when ever you please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>But how are you sure my Father knows I am in Town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Sure on't, Sir! why I saw him, and told him you came but Two hours ago—and that, you'd wait upon him as soon as you had refresh'd your self with clean Linning—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Z'death, and why did you so Sirrah?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Because, Sir, that was the first excuse that came at my Tongues end—and you know there is no humming and hawing with my Old Master, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>I am in a blessed Condition,—in Love, with I know not who, to be found I know not where—undoubtedly out of Favour with my Father, if I refuse his Choice, as I most certainly shall—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Nay, good Sir, ben't over certain—may be she's as handsome as t'other—and you may like her as well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>And, in all probability, in danger of a Duel with my Friend—to rectify all these matters, require a Machivilian Brain—go you wait at t'other Lodgings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir.—Now has he so many Women upon his Hands, he knows not what to do with 'em—the first time I ever saw him puzzled in these matters—</p>

<stage>Lady <hi>Cautious</hi> passing over the Stage.</stage>
<sp>

<p>My Charmer! the sight of thee dispels my malancholy, and revives the Joy within my Breast, which first those Eyes inspired—</p>

<p>Why, were you Malancholy, Sir? impossible.</p>

<sp>

<p>As constant as the Sun, my fairest—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>What, like him, Court all you meet, and quit as soon as tasted—Nature never design'd my Sex to feed your Luxery—but for Health, Content and Necessaries.</p>

<p>Right, why then can you deny the Man that endeavours to engross those Necessaries you speak of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>Where they are Lawful—but upon second thoughts, I find I have scruples—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Vapors, Vapors, all—Lawful! Why the Mechanical notion I have of the World, is a rich Banquet, set off with all the choicest things of the Creation—where Man's the guest—and wou'd it not be the height of ill Manners to snatch a Dish, and run away with it, when, perhaps, twenty more had a mind to the same Meat—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>And wou'd it not be the extremity of Folly to tast of every Dish—when your curiosity may bring a Surfci.—</p>

<p>Yes, I forbad you—and what was the Door shut for, ha?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>I shall be found out, there's no avoiding it—because I was afraid the stranger which you say hates Women shou'd surprize me—I came hither to be private, and to avoid the Impertinency of Sir <hi>Paul—</hi>I tremble every Joint. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Ay, she did come to avoid Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> that's plain enough—Oh, Nature, Nature, why did'st thou make a Woman?—I'm sure I heard his Voice—far off he cannot be—that Closet must conceal him—I'm glad to find you was so Circumspect, Sister—I am out of Humour—you'l forgive me—how shall I get rid of her. <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>This is no time, except you wish my Ruin—my Brother is alarm'd, and may return this Minute, and Sacrifice me to his Jealouse Fears—have you no regard for my safety—yet will you loiter to undo me.</p>

<p>I'm glad to hear that—but did not she know me? So took her Opportunity to start from my Vengeance? It may be so, and this be all a Lye—it must be so—and now I cou'd rip that Bosome where her Heart, her hot Lustful

<p>THUS far, Sir, I have had a strict regard to the League we made in <hi>Spain—</hi>serv'd you in the Minutest, as well as greatest things, even beyond the Character of a Gentleman in helping you to impose upon a Lady, making good Manners subservient to my Friendship.</p>

<stage>Enter Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> pulling in Lady <hi>Cautious.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>You, troop, troop—there, Sir, take your Sister, and get out of my House—do so—you shan't bring Gallants under my Nose, and lend your Lodgings to Rascals that wou'd Cut my Throat—mercy upon me, 'tis a Miracle the House don't tumble on our Heads—I admire I'm alive—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>Thou art alive, indeed, and that's all—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>All, Housewife, why, why, why, you han't poison'd me, or wounded me, have you?
<stage>(Looking and seeling about him)</stage>
<hi>Basilicon</hi>
<stage>[Enter <hi>Basilicon.</hi>]</stage>
why, where are you, Rascal? Look, am I hurt—do I Bleed any where?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Basi.</speaker>
<p>Not a drop, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>Can you know by my Eyes, or Hands, or any thing, if all be right within me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Basi.</speaker>
<p>Very easily, Sir—you are in perfect Health—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>You are sure on't?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bas.</speaker>
<p>I am sure on't, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>Why then, Mistress, what do you mean, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="54" facs="62"/>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>That thou art an old Doating—Despicable Wretch.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Hold, Sister—better Language to your Husband wou'd become you—and for you, Sir, since your ill Manners proceed from groundless Jealousies, Taxing a Gentleman with Crimes of which I know him Innocent—making that a pretence to traduce the Virtue of your Wife—I advise you to recall your Temper, and use her like my Sister—or I shall use you like my Enemy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>And run me thro' the Guts, I suppose—was ever man thus plagu'd before!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p><stage>(Weeping,)</stage> This is the life I lead—my Vertue still suspected—my Innocence accus'd, and the quiet of my Life destroy'd—Did I truly merit his abuses—Patience and Submission wou'd become me—but I defy, even the Tongue of Malice, to asperse my Fame or Conduct—and do you think, Brother, I'll indure this—tamely to Submit and Cringe to what I hate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>One word, Madam,—
<stage>(pulls her aside.)</stage>
Boast not of your Conduct, nor your Virtue—Vile Audacious Woman—the Closet, Mistress, think on the Closet.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>Does he know that? now, I'm lost sor ever.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Now, Vent your clamorous Virtue—while those in whose hands you lodge it, Echo back, you have none.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>What sure Disgrace attends Unlawful Love; had I really fall'n, I now shou'd die with shame.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>What are they whispering about, Now—contriving to make me away, ten to one, <hi>Basilicon.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bas.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, I defy 'em to do that whilst I am near you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>Oh, Brother, forgive me; 'twas the only slip I ever made—methinks I hate my self, for having, but in wish, consented, and grow in love with Virtue.—Since I have not stain'd my Family—the most was Thought, for some good Angel still did interpose to prop my Nodding Virtue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Take heed it nods no more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>I will, for now the Shame and Ruin that must have attended me, are so conspicious to my Sight, that I will shun
<pb n="55" facs="63"/>
even the resemblance of a Crime like this; if you'l but pardon me, I'll vow never to fall again from Duty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will,</speaker>
<p>On that condition I do—and now, Sister, since your Marriage-Knot can never be dissolv'd, till Nature slips it—shew your self the Pattern of a Virtuous Wife, indulge his Age—and that way preserve your Ease, and by your Meakness and Humility, fix your Reputation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I readily obey—Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> my Youth has hitherto engaged me in a foolish Passion, Contradictory to your Will, but my Brother's Instructions has so far inform'd me of my Duty, that my Behaviour, for the future, shall give you no cause for Complaint.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>I'll engage my Honour for the performance of her Promise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>Here's a turn; who can find what Plot is going forward—Are you both in earnest now, or not?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Pray, be less Suspicious, and more a Man—the less you suspect, the more you are secur'd, Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>A generous Confidence, will always oblige your Wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Well, for once I will trust thee—come to my Arms then—hold, hold, let me see—you have no Pen-knife nor Pistole about you, have you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>To what purpose, my Dear,—Nay, did you not say, you'd trust me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>Well, so I will then <stage>(Embrace.)</stage></p>

<p>Sir, here's a Gentleman, calls himself <hi>Positive,</hi> to wait on you, Mrs. <hi>Beliza,</hi> and another young Lady, with him.</p>

<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>Bring them in immediately, I have not seen him this many a Year—and your Mistress too <hi>Will,</hi> we'l have a Match before you part, a faith we will, my old Friend—</p>

<p>Wellcome, I'm glad to see thee with all my Heart, Ladies, you are Wellcome—</p>

<p>Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> your Hand—I cou'd not come to Town without seeing you, Faith—this is your Lady, I suppose; by your leave, Madam. <stage>(Salutes her.)</stage> This is my Daughter, Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> I am come up to Marry her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>Why then, I wish her much Joy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>I shou'd be proud of being better known to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>And I of your Acquaintance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>Dear <hi>Beliza,</hi> how do you expect I shou'd forgive your long absence? Not see me in two Days.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>I confess my fault.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>The readiest way to be pardon'd, is not to persist in the wrong, indeed, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>But who shall judge between Right and Wrong?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Our Reason, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>That very often deceives us, especially if we put too much trust in the Person.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>It requires Judgment therefore, to make a proper choice, for every accident depends on that; but why this indifference, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Why, that Question?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Because Love requires more freedom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>But Jealousy forbids it, Sir <hi>William.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will,</speaker>
<p>Only the effect of too much Love; I ask your Pardon for all past Offences.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Rather of too much Folly. <stage>(Enter <hi>Belair.</hi>)</stage> Ha, <hi>Revell,</hi> at liberty again—and here, what can this mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, your Servant—Sir <hi>William,</hi> <stage>(takes him aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I presume you are the Father of this Lady.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>And, what then, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Then, my request is, to be admitted for your Son-in-Law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pos.</speaker>
<p>For my Son-in-Law—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, provided I make it appear my Fortune, and Family are equal to yours—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pos.</speaker>
<p>Sir, in one word—if you cou'd prove your Descent from the Blood-Royal, and as many Acres of Land as the <hi>Po</hi> has engross'd, 'twou'd not avail you that, do you see <stage>(snaps his Fingers.)</stage> my Word's my Word, she's dispos'd off already, and so give you self no farther Trouble.</p>

<p>Heart-breaking Sentence, <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Is this your final Resolution, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pos.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, what reason have you to believe I shou'd alter it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Because, Sir, I have some Reasons to believe, your Daughter Loves me—and I hope you'l not force her Inclinations—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pos.</speaker>
<p>You have some Reasons to believe she Loves you—what Reasons, Sir, what Reasons? You have not lain with her, have you? for that is the surest reason a Man can build upon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>You Surprise me, with your Question, Sir,—and make me blush, to hear you give utterance to a thought like that—Your Daughter's Virtue needs no guard against such foul advances.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pos.</speaker>
<p>I hope not—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>I ne're shall give you Cause, to doubt my Virtue, Sir, and 'tis unkindly urg'd—I own, I Love this Gentleman.</p>
</sp>

<p>What, this is he, that you have pick'd up since you came to Town, is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="58" facs="66"/>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>This is he, that sav'd my Life, Sir—and if I have him not, I ne're can love another; yet your Commands shall fix me as you please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul,</speaker>
<p>Well said.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pos.</speaker>
<p>As to your Love, and Liking, that's out of my Power, but your Portion and Person are not—so whether you consent or not, 'tis the same thing—look ye, my word's my word, so never trouble your self about that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Is it so, I'll not leave the sight of her—till I see my Rival—and then the best Arm carry her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>And, this is your worthy Friend, you have so often mentioned, Sir <hi>William?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>The same, another time I'll inform you of every thing, and hope to obtain your Pardon for him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beliz.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I'm inclining to be good Natur'd; I like his humour mightily—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>But, Sir, have you no regard to the hazards which he run, to save my Life; had not his generous Care preserv'd me, you had now been Childless in your Age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pos.</speaker>
<p>Humph! Why, to say truth, I wou'd be grateful, but I want the means—he says, his Estate is large, so that he's above a Present—and I know not what to offer him—Sir, I thank you for the Service which you did my Daughter, and had I not given my Word, I might have chose you, as soon as another, but now, there's no help for't—if you'l be one of her Bride-men, you shall have a Favour to keep for her sake.</p>

<p>Ha! What do I see?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Now, Sir, shew a true Paternal Love, and force me not to Wed against my Will; for tho' the Lady you have chose, shou'd have all the Charms that bounteous Nature gave the whole Sex—there I am fixt—and must, and will, refuse her.</p>

<p>Well, Sir <hi>William,</hi> I'll run the dangerous venture of a Jealous Husband, for once; but let me Caution you, aforehand—the more you suspect my Conduct, the less I shall consult your Humour; the more you watch me, the more I shall study to deceive you—Leave then, your Spanish Airs—and put the true English Husband on, that is the only way to have a Virtuous Wife.</p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha, Mr. <hi>Wou'dbe</hi> out-Ploted.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>How was it, prithy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wou'd.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, you must know I had just made up such a suit of Cloaths as that you have on—and was coming hither, but meeting your Brother <hi>Ned,</hi> he wou'd needs press me to the Tavern to give him Beveridge, so in we went, the Fellow that waited on us, told me I had a Cut cross the Shoulder of my new Coat; I look'd, and found I had—he said there liv'd a Fine Drawer at next Door—he wou'd draw it up in a Minute; Wherefore I gave it him, but my Eyes ne'er Encountred him since.</p>

<p>I did, and they say he came in with me, and told them he was my Servant.</p>

<p>And that he never suffer'd a Drawer to wait on him, and therefore borrow'd an Apron of them to attend us.</p>

<p>To cheat me of my Coat—nothing vexes me so much, as that I have not been seen in it, had I but made the Tour of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and both Play-Houses, my Passion for it wou'd have Ebb'd to an indifference—and then—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Mr. <hi>Wou'dbe,</hi> might I advise you as a Friend, leave off this foolish Whim of Mimicking; Sir <hi>William</hi> he's a Gentleman of a plentiful Fortune, and can afford change of Cloaths for every Day; but you, whose slender Allowance from a Father's Hand, admits of no prosuceness—to imitate him is Madness.</p>

<speaker>Servant,</speaker>
<p>The Singers and Dancers are come, Sir.</p>
<stage>[Here is Songs and Dances.</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Bring 'em in, come, Gentlemen, take your Hats; but you forget, <hi>Bellair—Robin</hi> is unrewarded yet.</p>

<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Why, he shall Chuse between the two Maids.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Ah, <hi>Patch!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>Me do you Chuse?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Thou tempts me, and if I shou'd look any longer, perhaps the Devil might be more cunning then I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>You don't like me, then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Look ye, Marriage is a lasting thing—if it were for six Months only, I might venture upon thee—but for all days of my Life—mercy upon me—thy features are too high priz'd, Furniture for House-keeping, especially where they must let Lodgings—therefore, <hi>Flora,</hi> have at thee—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Why, will you quit her for me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>To show the Extreamity of my Love, I will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>Fool, did'st thou think I wou'd have had thee? Dost thou know that I have had my Nativity Cast, and am told that I shall Marry a Knight, at least, if not a Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rob.</speaker>
<p>Oh, good Night to your Ladyship, then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>Well, <hi>Patch,</hi> stay till my Brother Dies, and I'll Marry thee, to make good thy Calculation, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<p>Tho' you shou'd make me a Lady, you'd not better my fortune much by being your Wife, our Humours wou'd quickly Consume our Estate;—I love fine Cloths,—fine Coach,—fine Equipage, and fine House;—Your Drinking, Wenching, Gaming, and, soforth—that when I wanted a New Suit, in the Morning, you have flung off your Money over-Night—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>She has hit you home, Brother, for your Jesting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ned.</speaker>
<p>Well, since we know one another's Infirmities so well, we'll keep as we are—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Now, my fair <hi>Camilla,</hi> I am happy—these Arms shall fix my rambling Heart.</p>

<hi>Ungovern'd Youth, of Taste not over-nice,</hi></l>

<l><hi>Cheated with Health, they Ride thro' Pleasure Post,</hi></l>
<l><hi>To Purchase Liberty, what er'e it Cost.</hi></l>
