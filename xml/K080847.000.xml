<p>SECRETS WORTH KNOWING; A COMEDY, IN FIVE ACTS.</p>
<p>AS PERFORMED AT THE <hi>THEATRE ROYAL, COVENT GARDEN.</hi></p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>FROM Dryden's period to our present days,</l>
<l>Thus would be-critics censure modern plays;</l>
<l>Some are too dull, without intrigue, or jest—</l>
<l>And some mere speaking pantomimes at best;</l>
<l>That living authors are by dead surpast,</l>
<l>So he must write the worst, who writes the last—</l>
<l>Still each new drama captiously they blame,</l>
<l>And, though the town be pleas'd, deny it same.</l>
<l>Should this decision be allow'd as just,</l>
<l>The bays denied the Bard, may grace his bust!</l>
<l>But if this taste for antiques we pursue,</l>
<l>Age may improve wit, wine, and women too.</l>
<l>One <hi>old opinion</hi> we would still retain,</l>
<l>The right that England has to rule the main!</l>
<l>Long as the sea shall fence our envied land,</l>
<l>Long as our navy shall the sea command;</l>
<l>So long shall Howe's, St. Vincent's, Duncan's name,</l>
<l>Be grav'd by memory on the rock of same!</l>
<l>The page of hist'ry shall their deeds repeat,</l>
<l>With Britain's triumph, and the foe's defeat.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But ah! the pensive muse, with tearful eye,</l>
<l>Views glory's brightest triumph with a sigh!</l>
<l>And midst the shouts victorious fleets attend</l>
<l>Mourns o'er the ashes of an honoured friend,</l>
<l>Who in his country's quarrel fought and bled,</l>
<l>By England numbered with her patriot dead!</l>
<l>May war's alarms midst rival nations cease,</l>
<l>And all embrace that lovely stranger—Peace,</l>
<l>Whose olive branch once planted by her hand,</l>
<l>Shall bless a loyal, brave, and happy land.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>This night our Author's hopes on you are placed,</l>
<l>His former efforts by your smiles were graced;</l>
<l>To your decree submissively he bends,</l>
<l>Trusting his judges will be found his friends.</l>

<head>ACT I.</head>
<div3 n="1" type="scene">
<head>SCENE I.—<stage><hi>An Apartment in Greville House; Servants talking without.</hi></stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Valet, Butler, Coachman, Cook, <hi>and</hi> Footmen.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>VALET.</speaker>
<p>SILENCE, I say! Why, you keep as loud a gabbling as if you were settling the balance of Europe in the lobby of the House of Commons. Order, I say—the question is this. Our old master being dead, and our young one expected every moment from abroad, ought we, when he arrives, to laugh or cry? Hear the Cook!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cook.</speaker>
<p>Why, I thinks, that for the death of an old master, a little dripping from the eyes would be quite natural.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Valet.</speaker>
<p>It may be natural, master Cook; but lord bless you, the genteel feel of your tip top folks, is no more like nature, than one of your fine kabobbed fricassees is to plain roast and <hi>taties.</hi> Besides, when a man leaves behind him a good ten thousand a year, I think it quite natural for the heir to laugh. What say you, Coachy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Coach.</speaker>
<p>I pulls with you, Mr. Valet—young master must in the main be glad, for we all know that the old gemman seeing that he run skittish, kept him upon low provender beyond sea. So my verdict is, Mr. Butler, that we all smiles agreeably.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Butler.</speaker>
<p>So say I. Dam'me, I'll look as pleased as punch, ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Valet.</speaker>
<p>Softly. And will you, sir, who have but thirty pounds a-year, dare to be as pleased at seeing your master, as I, who have fifty? No, no —subordination is every thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coach.</speaker>
<p>Ecod, the best reason we should not be sorry, is, that the old Buck left us no legacies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Valet.</speaker>
<p>That settles it. <stage>(all laugh.)</stage> <stage>(a knocking at the door.)</stage> Here he comes—I am to look most pleased, and stand in the front. Back a little, Coachy, and remember I am to speak.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Mr. and Mrs.</hi> Greville.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>Why this boisterous mirth?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coach.</speaker>
<p>You are to speak, you know.</p>
<stage>(to the Valet.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>Is it thus you honor the memory of your departed master? My love, welcome to England, and to my father's house. If I can trust my heart, the greatest happiness I shall feel from prosperity, (should it await us,) will be in placing my Maria in the elevated station her virtues will illumine.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Sally, <hi>in a travelling dress, speaks as she enters.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>Travelling indeed! nothing but extortion I declare—Such a gang of them! First, in comes the bill; then remember the Waiter—John Ostler,
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>sir—the Chambermaid, ma'am—don't forget poor Boots—I am the Porter—the Post Boy, your honor—so that your hand keeps constantly moving up and down, up and down, like the great lump of wood at Chelsea waterworks.— <stage>(<hi>the</hi> Servants <hi>nod and wink to her.</hi>)</stage>—What are you all nodding and winking at? why don't you set chairs?— <stage>(Servants <hi>set chairs.</hi>)</stage>—Now, go along all of you, and see the luggage unpacked— <stage>(Servants <hi>surprized</hi>)</stage>— why don't you go?</p>
<stage>(Greville <hi>waves his hand.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Valet.</speaker>
<p>To be ordered about by such a dowdy! My dear Coachy, this will never do for us.</p>
<stage><hi>Exeunt</hi> Servants.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>A parcel of lazy chaps. I dare say—but I'll make them stir their stumps. Well, here we are at last. Oh gemini gig! how my poor bones do ache!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Greville.</speaker>
<p>My Greville, excuse her familiarity —she has lived with me from my infancy, and is, indeed, a faithful, affectionate creature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>Aye, that I am. Oh bless its pretty face!</p>
<stage>(patting her mistress's cheek.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Leave us, good Sally.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>Leave you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>Well, I will. I am a foolish, good natured—I'll go and scold the servants.</p>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Sally.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>You look uneasy, Charles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>'Tis for thy sake, Maria. Between hope and fear my mind is tortured: when I reflect on my father's determined, but just, resentment at my dissipated conduct while in England—so determined, that I dared not acquaint him of my union with my adored Maria—then I fear that he died without blessing me, and has estranged me from his house and fortune. When I reflect that I am
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>perhaps destitute of the means of supporting thee —surrounded by creditors— <stage>(a knocking at the door.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Sally.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>Oh! master, here is such a frightful old fellow wants to speak with you. Such a—Oh Lord! here he is.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> NICHOLAS, <hi>his face wrinkled, hollow cheeks, and every exhibition of dolefulness, age, and decrepitude.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>Your name, friend, and business?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Sir, my name is—so, there <hi>is</hi> a lady in the case—my name, sir, is Nicholas Rue, and my business will be explained by this letter. <stage>(Greville <hi>reads the letter, and seems elated with pleasure.</hi>)</stage> Now to have a peep, <stage>(puts on his spectacles.)</stage> Eh! as I hope to live these fifty years—Miss Egerton. How my master will be surprised!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>What happy tidings! present my best respects to your master—I will wait on him immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Very well, sir. How my master will be surprised!</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>This letter, Maria, is from my father's executor.</p>
<stage>(Reads.)</stage>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
As executor to my dear, departed friend, Mr. Greville, I have to inform you, his will leaves you, conditionally, his sole heir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>He! he! how happy I am!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>The familiarity of this girl is intolerable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
<speaker>Sally </speaker>
<stage>(pouting.)</stage>
<p>Tolerable indeed! Oh, Mr.Egerton, her noble brother behaved different: He never thought me tolerable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>For shame, Sally!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>And so it is a shame that a poor servant should be out of her wits for joy at hearing her dear lady's good fortune? Sir, I has as much right to be happy as you <hi>has,</hi> and I will be happy, tho' you make me cry all day for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>Well, Well—loving Maria atones for a thousand faults.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally. </speaker>
<stage>(significantly.)</stage>
<p>Ha! he! perhaps this is as lucky for Mister Somebody, as for Sally Downright.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Dear Sally—!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>Do you say dear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Pray be silent.</p>
<stage>(Sally <hi>puts her hand to her mouth, and retires.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>My love, I must hasten to Mr. Undermine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Who?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Undermine, my father's executor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Heavens!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>Do you know him, Maria!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Alas! too well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally. </speaker>
<stage>(advancing.)</stage>
<p>Know him! he is the blackest villain, sir—It was he who ruined her dear brother, and drove him from England, to wander, nobody knows where.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Greville! I doubt the goodness of that fortune to which he is harbinger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>You alarm me; but I will hasten to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>And I'll go with you, and, by gemini gig, I'll give it him—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>For heaven's sake, be quiet! Droop not my dearest love! 'Tis prosperity awaits us. I go
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>to seize the prize, and lay it at thy feet, a fit oblation to thy surpassing virtues.</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Heigho!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>Don't sigh, dear lady! I know from experience riches don't give happiness. When poor, I was happy, and now that I am independent, having £.3 10s. a year in the consolidated real grand Bank of England, yet I'm not happy; but I shall be so when my darling mistress is a great lady, and her dear brother comes home a general.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Poor Egerton! What perils has he not encountered for my sake—perhaps his precious life—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sally.</speaker>
<p>Oh, no, no—take comfort, for sure nobody wou'd go to kill so handsome and good a creature as he is—besides, ma'am, has not he a mole on his right arm? Was he not born with a cawl? And has he not a pocket-piece that I got conjured?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Peace, foolish girl! Yet I will take comfort, for he has the protecting arm of heaven.</p>

<head>SCENE II.—<stage><hi>A Room in</hi> UNDERMINE'S <hi>House,</hi></stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> NICHOLAS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich. </speaker>
<stage>(crossing the stage.)</stage>
<p>That the sister of Egerton shou'd be the lady—this is news indeed. They must be married, and then my old rogue of a master gets the estate, and poor I, only a thousand pounds for assisting in the roguery; but 'tis a snug sum.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> UNDERMINE, <hi>(yawning.)</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Good morning. You look ill, Nicholas.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear! don't say so—I feel pretty much in the old way—eat little to be sure—sleep less.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Ah! but you have been a sad old rogue, Nicholas.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>I have always executed your honor's commands faithfully. Sir, I don't like 12 o'clock at night. All dark as pitch! The church-bell tolling, and nothing else to be heard but the rats in the wainscott.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Don't talk of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Then, somehow a trembling seizes me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>And you feel a kind of shivering damp, don't you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>I know—I know. Then the dreams. I dreamt that old Greville came to my bed, and demanded justice to his son, with horrible ghastly eyes like—just like yours, Nicholas;—and—pshaw! I'm becoming a superstitious fool. Away to Greville with my letter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>I have already been there. You see how anxious I am to put you in possession.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>How anxious you are to touch the £.1000, Nicholas!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Well, sir! he is arrived, and with him—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Aye!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>A lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>His wife, think you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you who she is, and leave you to judge—the sister of Egerton.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Whom you ruined.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>And he deserved it for his folly. What chance had he, with only old blind justice on his side, while I had possession, a long purse, and a chancery suit, ha! ha! you don't laugh, Nicholas?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Lord, sir, I hav'n't laughed these thirty years.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Ah! you have been a sad rogue. But when am I to expect Greville?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Directly, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Then give me his father's will out of that drawer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich. </speaker>
<stage>(significantly.)</stage>
<p>Which will, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Which will? why, you are a wag, Nicholas. Not his <hi>second</hi> will, which you burnt. Ha! ha! you are a wag. No, no—this is the will for us, Nicholas; the second did not suit quite so well—it did not contain this beautiful provisoe—But in case my said son shall have acted, or shall act, contrary to this my will, I then bequeath all my estates, whatsoever and wheresoever, to my herein named executor, adviser, and valued friend, Urban Undermine esquire. —And was not I a good adviser, eh? But then, Nicholas, what trouble I had, to make the old superannuated fool sign it. How I had, to enforce the sin of disobedience, read to him all the tragical stories of improvident marriages—yet, Nicholas, we are not quite safe, while my late servants, the witnesses to the burnt will, are forth coming. Have you been to Newgate to see them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir; and says I to them—you know my master's plate was found at the bottom of your trunks, (which you know, sir, I put there myself,) and the law has condemned you to be hang'd— now your kind master has got your sentence softened to a <hi>mere</hi> trip to Botany Bay.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>And they were quite happy, I suppose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>No, sir—they grumbled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Ah! man—man—never contented. This is my reward for sending them to a charming
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>flourishing colony, where there is every luxury— even a play-house, Nicholas.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>And I am told, sir, there are very good actors there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>I dare say there are. <stage>(a knocking at the door.)</stage> Run to the window, and see if it be Greville.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Lord, sir, I can't run—nor I can't see.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und. </speaker>
<stage>(aside.)</stage>
<p>Pshaw! old withered dolt!—can't see—one comfort is, you will soon be dead.</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>But I can hear—Soon be dead, eh? Oh dear me, no—equally obliged to you notwithstanding —I am pretty well—indeed—excepting a slight liver complaint, a flying gout, and a touch of the dropsy, I am quite well—Ah! the one thousand pounds must be first duly and truly paid, or I'll shew you a trick you little expect, old master of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. Greville, I presume—allow me to congratulate you on your arrival in England. I hope you enjoyed your health abroad?</p>

<p>Sir, the pleasure I might otherwise feel at so large an acquisition of property as your <hi>marriage</hi> gives me, is really, sir, changed into anguish on your account.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>N—no—not married!—Is it possible that—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>It is quite possible.</p>

<p>Pardon me, <hi>good</hi> sir—the advice you have here given is so excellent, <stage>(returning the will,)</stage> that I should be deemed a monopolist, did I engross more. Let the world benefit; my family have had quite enough of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>In short, then, Mr. Greville—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Grev.</speaker>
<p>In short, then, Mr. Undermine, I am equal to the attendance on my own affairs. Do you prove your attention to yours, by promptly attending me in the capacity of executor, and not as heir, to my father. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>

</sp>

<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>Who the devil wants your help! Friend Undermine, how are you? heartily glad to see you, <stage>(shaking him violently by the hand.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Mr. April!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="16"/>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>What, old Nick! alive! You grow devilish like your namesake! Ha, ha! <stage>(stops laughing suddenly.)</stage> My dear Rose; ask pardon—forgot to introduce, and all that—Undermine, this is our ward, our pretty Rose—brought her up to town to see all the devilments and things, and marry her to my grandson Plethora, who is by this time, I warrant, a celebrated physician.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rose.</speaker>
<p>That is, Guardy, if I like him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>To be sure—no compulsion—no—no— You see mine has been a difficult task, friend Undermine—not only to take care of a large lump of land, but also this pretty little morsel of live stock.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rose.</speaker>
<p>Which is certainly the harder task of the two; for where you leave a pasture at night, there you are sure to find the pasture in the morning; but you may leave me peaceably browzing in that pasture in the evening, and the next day, hear of my curvetting and frisking it on a certain Green, called Gretna.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha! madam, you will be esteemed a wit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>She will—for she has three thousand a year, ha, ha! But, old Nick, have not you a bit of dried wainscot in the house, commonly called a housekeeper. Rose will want an army of miliners, haberdashers, and odds and ends.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nich.</speaker>
<p>Do you imagine, sir, we exist without the blandishments of the softer sex? Allow me to conduct you—don't be alarm'd, miss, you may rely on my prudence and delicacy.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exeunt</hi> Nicholas <hi>and</hi> Rose.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>Come, let me look at you, old boy. You are grown devilish rusty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Impudent blockhead!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>My countenance is the same.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="17"/>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Yes, brass never rusts; but you must want repose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>Repose, ha, ha! Why I walked good twenty miles yesterday, over hedge and stubble, to shoot you a bag of birds, old boy. How you stare!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>How the devil have you contrived to keep so ruddy a face?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>By keeping clean hands, friend Undermine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>And how do you manage to keep your body upright?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>By keeping my heart in the same attitude; for I soon found out that the weight of every illgotten guinea is laid on a man's shoulders for life —bends him down—there is no getting rid of the load. <stage>(Undermine <hi>tries to hold up his head, but fails.</hi>)</stage> So I preferr'd a long life to a long annuity, and a light heart to a heavy purse, eh, master Undermine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>A most excellent plan indeed—for the country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>Well, but the news—is Greville arrived? The young heir—the dear boy, Charles—is he well?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Yes, a pretty chick he is—a profligate—a seducer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>What! Oh, I see—a joke of yours, to try to prevent my laughing, ha, ha! Eh, you shake your head tho'.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>What would you say, if I told you he had basely seduced a virtuous and superior woman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>I would say it was a lie.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Go then, and convince yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>What Charles Greville guilty of dishonor, merely to get a fashionable name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="18"/>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>And even there he will be disappointed. Formerly, indeed, the ruin of an innocent woman was thought wickedness enough to entitle you to a seat in the cotorie of fashion; but now, unless that woman be the wife of your friend, or the daughter of your benefactor, your gusto is scouted, and you are black-balled for want of a due qualification.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>Oh, rare London, ha, ha! Should not laugh tho'.—Sad doings. I'll go to him; if what you say be true, he wont dare to look even me in the face—but it can't be.—Oh! he was the bravest, noblest lad. I'll tell you stories of him, will make you so laugh, ha, ha! And I'll tell you stories will make you so cry.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Grev.</speaker>
<p>Alas! I think but this—it was my Greville asked it; and I solemnly swear by the holy marriage vow, never to claim the honour'd name of wife, but at your command.</p>

<p>Leave her with me. I know I can prevail. Retire, my love.</p>

<p>What, he likes greyhounds—then I dare say he is a fine fellow. I'll think no more of Greville— And so, your love was platonic, eh? —Ha! ha! —nay, if I can't laugh, 'tis all over with me. yes, I will leave your house.

<p>Yes; and to a lady who has all the requisites for an excellent wife. In the first place, she is esteemed beautiful by all who have seen her— fine estate in Worcestershire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>Fine estate! I shou'd like to sell it—freehold or copyhold?</p>

<p>How the devil should I know. In the next place, she is remarkably sensible and witty— that I had from a gentleman who says her estate is the prettiest in the county.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>A most excellent authority.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>And thirdly, she has a crowd of lovers, which certainly proves—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>That her estate is the prettiest in the county; quite natural, for now a-days no gentleman comes more frequently to the hammer than little Cupid—but I must away; this purse makes me very fidgetty.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Eger.</speaker>
<p>'Tis strange, that I should pass unheeded amidst a crowd of friends, that none should know me; surely the necromancers of old were fools to study life away in vain attempts to become impervious to human sight, when, to render themselves invisible to their nearest friends, 'twas only to put on the garb of wretchedness. <stage>(<hi>takes out a miniature.</hi>)</stage> This is the only treasure I have left—my sweetest Rose. <stage>(<hi>kisses the picture.</hi>)</stage> But what have I to do with love or happiness.

<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>Plague take this purse; I don't know what to do with it. I don't care two-pence for horses—I hate gaming. I can't drive curricles. And as for the once concealed charms of the fair— no need of a purse for that—now a-days, they are all to be seen gratis.—Heigho! I am no more fit to be a blood, than my uncle is to be a bishop—I have nothing to do—no where to go—Oh! what a cursed bore it is to be a gentleman.—Eh! what have we here—Oh! I see a soldier returned from the wars in the full dress of victory—As we <hi>conoscenti</hi> say, 'tis a grand head, and in nature's best manner. On canvass it would fetch twenty guineas, but on the shoulders of a poor soldier nobody will give sixpence for it—throw this
<pb n="34" facs="37"/>to the devil—no—suppose, instead, I try to get my name inserted in a better catalogue. —Sir, your most obedient—this fine sharp air gives a keen appetite.</p>

<p>Sir!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>I don't mean to offend.—You seem a stranger; give me leave, sir, to shew you the lions— that small gentleman, with a large coronet, is a new peer of ninety-seven—that lady all the bucks are ogling, is an old woman of ninety-seven—that seven feet giant is a milliner—that gentleman running across the way to shake hands with a bailiss, is over head and ears in debt; don't be surprised, he is in parliament—in the phaeton with little ponies fits a female gambler, and a great orator: The female gambler, the great orator, and the little ponies are all upon sale, and may be knocked down to the best bidder.—I was once a delightful auctioneer—my present trade is buckism—pray, sir what may your trade be?</p>

<p>I will tell thee, for thou hast deserved to know them—When I had given thee all, I sought my fortunes in a German regiment in the pay of England; we were ordered to the West Indies —there, slowly recovering from the pestilential fever of the island, my emaciated state would not allow me to dress in the ranks with my usual alacrity; the consequence was, that from the cane of a young ensign I received on my shoulders a blow. <stage>(<hi>rising.</hi>)</stage> Yes, a blow—in the paroxism of madness I felled him with the earth, <stage>(<hi>sinks again into</hi>

<p>Oh! my brother.</p>

<p>I shall soon conclude—I flew with desperation on my guard, hoping from them to meet the death I longed for—I was deceived, they favoured my escape—at that moment thy image rushed upon my heart, and nature bade me struggle with my fate, and find a sister—I have found her, and may the heavy curse—</p>

<p>Oh yes—very sudden this. I felt quite well just now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>Did you? That's an alarming symptom; for I have always observed, that nothing makes the physcian look so grave, as the patient's saying he feels quite well. My dear friend, send for one directly.</p>

<p>At the auctioneer again. Zounds! you are so fond of it, I dare say you would sell me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I would knock you down with all the pleasure in life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>But what of the key?—the key—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>The key certainly opened the drawer you

mentioned; and it as certainly opened a drawer you did not mention.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>Be quiet. There I found a parcel of papers, and title deeds, which you must have put there entirely by mistake, my dear sir, because I perceived they belonged to Mr. Egerton.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>Give them to me directly, directly—I say, sir, restore—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>Every thing to its right owner. Certainly —I don't wish to keep your, or any man's property —so, Egerton, there are your papers again— and, Uncle, there is your key again.</p>

<p>Well, you have managed finely for yourself however—I discard you. Had you followed my instructions, you would have been exalted—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>To the pillory, I suppose.—No sir, tho' you don't scruple it to others, far be it from me to rob <hi>you</hi> of your natural inheritance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Und.</speaker>
<p>I would have left you all I am worth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>What then? you forget all you are worth belongs to other people. When you were gone, they would naturally ask me for their own, and how could I have the face to refuse them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>Give me your hand. You have acted your part nobly; and now 'tis my turn.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>I believe I shall trouble you with a word or two.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>Indeed!—Sir, to shew my fairness, I'll leave this point to your decision.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may tire you?</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April. </speaker>
<stage>(substituting the second will, reads.)</stage>
<p>I, Robert Greville, do declare this my last will.— To my only son, Charles Greville, I give and bequeath my forgiveness and my blessing, together with all my estates real and personal.— Umph! that is very entertaining.</p>

<p>What does this mean!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>April.</speaker>
<p>Mean!—That my young master, my friend, my dear Charles, is happy—that my old master is in heaven, and that I am in heaven; two wills were made; by the last, which he endeavoured to suppress, you are sole heir, without reservation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>It must be very reasonable.</p>

Roguery is the worst trade a man can follow; for (to the credit of human nature) I sincerely believe, that where one fortune is raised by pursuing the devious mazes of chicanery, a hundred are acquired by walking in the simple path of industrious integrity.</p>

<lg>
<l>SECRETS worth knowing—Shall I tell you one?</l>
<l>Don't frown, or our poor Bard will be undone.</l>
<l>Change to a grin his present woeful phiz,</l>
<l>Last year he cur'd your Heart Ache, now cure his.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But leaving him, as we're left here alone,</l>
<l>Suppose I tell a secret of my own.</l>
<l>Know then, I think—tho' women will be craving.</l>
<l>Your men-folks at the best are scarce worth having.</l>
<l>No more entire—they go about by halves,</l>
<l>Like legs consumptive, that have lost their calves;</l>
<l>What with their crops, slouched gait, and short surtouts,</l>
<l>Half heads, half tails, half manners, and half boots.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>A wife, or an old maid! Aye, that's the question;</l>
<l>Both bitter pills, and bad for our digestion;</l>
<l>The prim old maid detests all amorous hussies,</l>
<l>Her nursery's confin'd to pups and pussies;</l>
<l>Pug's her gallant, and her dear fondled baby,</l>
<l>Master Grimalkin, or grey-ey'd miss Tabby.</l>
<l>"Man, what an animal! to love to hug,</l>
<l>"Puppies they are; but not like my sweet pug,</l>
<l>"Prating as parrots, obstinate as donkies;</l>
<l>"We'd better all lead apes than follow monkies."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The wife poor thing, at first so blithe and chubby,</l>
<l>Scarce knows again her lover in her hubby;</l>
<l>No more—"my charming dear! my sweetest life,"</l>
<l>'Tis—"stir that fire, give me some coffee, wife."</l>
<l>"There —now you've burnt my fingers;—what a ninny</l>
<l>"My dog's more <hi>nouse</hi> than you, I'll bet a guinea!"</l>
<l>He flies about to swallow port by dozens;</l>
<l>She stays at home, to mope with aunts and cousins.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Some wives there are, perhaps as well intentioned,</l>
<l>More spirited than such as I have mentioned;</l>
<l><pb facs="74" ana="y"/>Flirt at the opera, gamble at quadrille,</l>
<l>Run down a character, run up a bill;</l>
<l>Should spouse not be at dinner to say grace,</l>

<l>Invade man's province, bluster and look big,</l>

<l>Beneath the covert of this curly grove.</l>
<l>It shields one too; for, should some wag, in scoff,</l>
<l>Assault my scratch, he can but scratch it off.</l>
<l>Shall I, in future, then, this helmet wear?</l>

<p n="1">1. WALSINGHAM; or, the PUPIL of NATURE; a Domestic Story, interspersed with Poetry. By MARY ROBINSON, Author of Angelina, Poems, &amp;c. &amp;c. In Four large Volumes, 12mo. Price 16s. sewed.</p>

<p>In five large volumes, 12mo. Price 1l. 5s. Boards.</p>
<quote>Mr. Pratt has introduced to a numerous set of readers a novel that has the merit of being at once tender, pathetic, and full of love; and, which may be a more uncommon circumstance, of love mixed with the greatest discretion.</quote>
<bibl><hi>Monthly Review, May</hi> 1797.</bibl>
<quote>In the volumes before us, there are several beautiful and affecting strokes of nature.</quote>
<bibl><hi>Analytical Review, April</hi> 1797.</bibl>
<p n="3">3. A GOSSIP's STORY and LEGENDARY TALE. By Mrs. WEST, Author of Advantages of Education, &amp;c. In two Volumes 12mo. Price 7s. in Boards.</p>
<quote>We can recommend this story as uniting to a great degree of interest the rarer qualities of good sense, and an accurate knowledge of mankind. The grammatical errors and vulgarisms which disgrace many even of our most celebrated novels, have here no place; and several of the shorter poetical pieces interspersed through the work, have very considerable merit. Amusement is combined with utility, and fiction is inlisted in the cause of virtue and practical philosophy.</quote>
<bibl><hi>Monthly Review, January</hi> 1797.</bibl>
<p n="4">4. CLARA DUPLESSIS and CLAIRANT: The HISTORY of a FAMILY of FRENCH EMIGRANTS. Translated from the German. In Three Volumes, 12mo. Price 10s. 6d. Boards.</p>
<p>This pathetic novel, or relation of facts, has been deservedly successful in its, native country, and at Paris.—</p>
<p>The characters are drawn with a truth of nature which is truly admirable.</p>

<p n="7">7. BIOGRAPHICAL, LITERARY, and POLITICAL ANECDOTES, of-several of the most EMINENT PERSONS of the PRESENT AGE; particularly the Dukes of Grafton, Leeds, Dorset, and Rutland; Lords Townshend, Orford, Marchmont, Mansfield, Camden, Temple, Nugent, and Sackville; Bishops of Hereford and Ossory; Right Hon. George Grenville, Charles Townshend; Sir James Caldwell, Sir Grey Cooper, Sir John Dalrymple, Serjeant Adair, Dr. Franklin, and many others. Never before printed; in Three Volumes. Price 18s.</p>
<p>The Monthly Critics, who have already reviewed this new work, speak of it in the following words:</p>
<p>The writers of the Monthly Revicw for last month say, "We cannot dismiss these volumes without observing, that they contain a considerable portion of political information. The work will, by its discerning readers, be characterized as highly interesting; and it will prove particularly so to those who still remember the times to which the anecdotes here recorded are referable. To the future historian also it will afford much assistance, by contributing, in many instances, towards the means of information, which, but for publications of this kind, might be utterly consigned to oblivion.</p>
<p>The writers of the Analytical Review for January last, say, "The work before us will be found particularly interesting to those who wish to obtain an idea of the management of state affairs in this country, during the whole of the present reign."</p>
<p>The writers of the Gentleman's Magazine for January last, say, "These volumes are written by the author of the Anecdotes of the late Earl of Chatham, and are not inferior to that work either in interest or intelligence. Those persons who are fond of reading the political anecdotes of their own times, particularly from the year 1760 to the year 1780, (an important period), which, the writer assures us, have not been printed, will receive fiom this work much pleasure and information."</p>
<p>The writers of the European Magazine, say, "The editor of these volumes is entitled to the thanks of the public, for preserving many facts which otherwise might have fallen into oblivion. The reader will find entertainment and information in them, and the future investigator of the acts of the present reign will meet with some valuable materials to exercise his sagacity upon, which are to be no where else found, and which will serve to guide him through the obscure paths of political finesse."</p>
<p n="8">8. The ANECDOTES of LORD CHATHAM's LIFE. The Sixth Edition. In Three Volumes, 8vo. Price 18s. Boards.</p>
<quote>The author has made a valuable Collection of Anecdotes, especially of the late and most conspicuous part of Lord Chatham's Life; and of other matters connected with it. He says he is not conscious of having advanced one falsehood: We give credit to his declaration, having found no cause to doubt it.</quote>
<bibl><hi>Monthly Review, May</hi> 1792.</bibl>
<pb facs="77"/><p>A greater number of curious and interesting anecdotes, concerning public affairs, have not appeared since the days of Sir William Temple, than are to be found in this work.</p>
<p>We cannot dismiss this article without acknowledging, that it throws a great and new light upon the occurences and events of more than half a century of our history.</p>
<bibl><hi>Gent. Mag. Aug.</hi> 1793.</bibl>
<p n="9">9. A RESIDENCE in FRANCE, during the Years 1792, 3, 4, &amp; 5; described in a Series of Letters from an ENGLISH LADY, with general and incidental Remarks on the French Character and Manners. Prepared for the Press by JOHN GIFFORD Esq. In Two Volumes, 8vo. Price 14s. Boards. The Third Edition.</p>
<quote>It is only justice to say, that the style is as polished as the matter is interesting and important: nor have we any doubt that the book will remain a permanent monument of the taste and talents of the writer.</quote>
<bibl><hi>British Critick, April</hi> 1797.</bibl>
<p n="10">10. GLEANINGS THROUGH WALES, HOLLAND, and WESTPHALIA; with Views of Peace and War at Home and Abroad. To which is added, HUMANITY; or, The Rights of Nature: A Poem. Revised and corrected. By Mr. PRATT. In Three Volumes, 8vo. Price One Guinea in Boards. Third Edition.</p>
<quote>We have found so many lively and pleasant exhibitions of manners, so many amusing and interesting anecdotes, and so many observations and reflections, gay and grave, sportive and sentimental, (all expressed in a gay and familiar style,) better suited to the purpose than sentences laboured with artificial exactness, that we cannot but recommend it to our readers as a highly amusing and interesting performance.</quote>
<bibl><hi>Analytical Review, Jan.</hi> 1796.</bibl>
<p n="11">11. An HISTORY, or ANECDOTES of the REVOLUTION in RUSSIA, in the Year 1762. Translated from the French of M. DERULHIERE. With an elegant Head of the late EMPRESS. Second Edition. Price 4s. sewed.</p>
<p>The grounds of M. De Rulhiere's information seem indisputable, and his readers appear to have every reason to be satisfied with his discernment, in unfolding the motives and circumstances that concurred in bringing about this striking event. He is no servile copier, but has drawn his characters, and described his scenes, with the hand of a master.</p>
<p>We shall only add, that we have seldom met with more interesting original anecdotes, than those that are contained in the little work which we have now reviewed.</p>
