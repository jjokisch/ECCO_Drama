<p>A DAY IN TURKEY; OR, THE RUSSIAN SLAVES.</p>
<p>A COMEDY, AS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, IN COVENT GARDEN.</p>
<p>BY MRS. COWLEY.</p>
<p>THE SECOND EDITION.</p>
<p>LONDON: PRINTED FOR G. G. J. AND J. ROBINSON, IN PATER-NOSTER-ROW. MDCCXCII.</p>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>HINTS have been thrown out, and the idea industriously circulated, that the following comedy is tainted with POLITICS. I protest I know nothing about politics;—will Miss Wolstonecraft forgive me—whose book contains such a body of mind as I hardly ever met with—if I say that politics are <hi>unfeminine?</hi> I never in my life could attend to their discussion.</p>
<p>TRUE COMEDY has always been defined to be a picture of life—a record of passing manners—a mirror to reflect to succeeding times the characters and follies of the present. How then could I, pretending to be a comic poet, bring an emigrant Frenchman before
<pb facs="3"/>
the public at this day, and not make him hint at the events which had just passed, or were then passing in his native country? A character so written would have been anomalous—the critics ought to have had no mercy on me. It is A LA GREQUE who speaks, not <hi>I</hi>; nor can I be accountable for <hi>his</hi> sentiments. <hi>Such</hi> is my idea of tracing CHARACTER; and were I to continue to write for the stage, I should always govern myself by it.</p>
<p>THE illiberal and <hi>false</hi> suggestions concerning the politics of the comedy I could frankly forgive, had they not deprived it of the honour of a COMMAND. The passages on which those misrepresentations were built, were on the second night omitted, but immediately afterwards restored; and the DAY IN TURKEY leaves the press exactly as it has continued to be performed amidst the most vivid and uninterrupted plaudits—or interrupted only by the glitter of soft tears; a species of applause not less flattering than the spontaneous laugh, or the voluntary collision of hands.</p>
<p><pb facs="4"/>SOME of the performers in this comedy have play'd so transcendently well, that their names deserve to be recorded; but to particularise any, when <hi>all</hi> have aim'd at perfection, would be invidious.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<stage>SPOKEN BY MR. HARLEY.</stage>
<lg>
<l>NOT from the present moment springs our play,</l>
<l>Th' events which gave it birth are past away—</l>
<l>Five glowing moons have chas'd night's shades from earth,</l>
<l>Since the war fled which gave our Drama birth.</l>
<l>"<hi>Not smiling peace o'er</hi> RUSSIA's <hi>wide-spread land</hi></l>
<l>"<hi>Wav'd gently</hi> then, <hi>her sceptre of command.</hi></l>
<l>"<hi>No! thousands rush'd at red ambition's call,</hi></l>
<l>"<hi>With mad'ning rage to triumph—or to fall.</hi></l>
<l>"<hi>'Twas then our female bard from</hi> BRITAIN'S <hi>shore</hi></l>
<l>"<hi>Was led by fancy to the distant roar</hi>"—</l>
<l>'Twas then she saw sweet virgins captives made,</l>
<l>'Twas then she saw the cheek of beauty fade,</l>
<l>Whilst the proud soldier in ignoble chains,</l>
<l>Was from his country dragg'd to hostile plains.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus was her bold imagination fired</l>
<l>When battle with its horrid train retired;</l>
<l>Yet, sure the story which she then combin'd,</l>
<l>Should not to drear oblivion be resign'd—</l>
<l>No—let it still your various passions raise,</l>
<l>And to have touch'd them, oft', has been her praise:</l>
<l>Trusting to candour, she solicits here,</l>
<l>Your smile of pleasure, or your pity's tear;</l>
<l>For tho' the <hi>time</hi> is past, the FEELING true,</l>
<l>She dedicates to NATURE, and to YOU!</l>

<stage>IN THE BACK GROUND A TURKISH CAMP.</stage>
<stage>Several Turks are seen at a Distance passing and repassing with Haste; some of them look out from amidst the Trees, and then retire.</stage>

<stage>At the Bottom</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>WHERE—O, where shall we fly?
<stage>[Looking round wildly.]</stage>
Brother—father—come! We are driven from our cottage; we have no longer a home—let us run some where to seek another.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> OLD MAN <hi>and</hi> SON.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SON.</speaker>
<p>Come father lean on me, and let us walk faster, or we shall be pick'd up by some of the turban'd gentry.
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
They are out a foraging; and they always consider christians as useful cattle. Let us fly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FATHER.</speaker>
<p>Fly! alas, with the load of seventy years upon my shoulders, how hard a task! We shall never escape them, child—Thou'lt see thy father murdered, and worse luck than that will be thy fate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>Worse luck than to be murdered! I should be glad to see the day—What worse <hi>can</hi> happen?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD MAN.</speaker>
<p>Thou'lt be made a slave,—slave to a Turk
<stage>[CRIES]</stage>
—I shall see thee in a vile Turk's seraglio, no better, as it were, than the handmaid of a Jew.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>Well, I may out-live such a misfortune as that; but I never heard of out-living a throat cut—So, dear father, cheer up, and let us hurry on to the next village. Peter, take care of that bag—for it contains all we have in the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SON.</speaker>
<p>Aye; and if it hadn't been for some of our own soldiers, I had been a lost man—They were so kind as to strip our cottage yesterday, and left us no more than I can very <hi>conveniently</hi> move under.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and more than all that, they took away my very best gown, and my new fur cap!
<stage>[crying]</stage>
yes; and he who took them said it was in friendship, for that otherwise my very best gown and cap would certainly fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SON.</speaker>
<p>Yes; it was truly a very friendly action, and they perform'd it like gentlemen—No words, but their very looks were oaths, and the black eyebrows of one of them spoke louder curses than I ever heard between fifty Siberian boar-hunters
<stage>[clashing of swords without.]</stage>
There—there! d'ye hear? Our friends are coming
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
down upon us; and our enemies are at hand! Come, let us run

—From friends and enemies, holy Michael, defend us!
<stage>Exeunt.</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage>[<hi>Clashing of swords</hi>; A LA GREQUE <hi>enters running at top, then stops, looks back and speaks.</hi>]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>There it goes—There it goes! Nothing can save thee, my gallant master—This comes of your reconnoitering—Had you not better have been in your tent, quietly breaking your <hi>fast,</hi> than here, breaking the heads of the Turks—So, now he's disarm'd—Well, nobody bid ye—'tis all your own fault—Now, how comely he looks with his arms folded, and his sword in the hands of that beetle-brow'd Turk! Pardie! I feel now as great a man as my master.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ORLOFF, <hi>surrounded by Turks.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MULEY.</speaker>
<p>Courageous Russian, thou art ours! Could valour have saved thee, captivity and you had never met —Your empress, we trust, has not many such soldiers in the neighbouring camp.—Come, droop not, Sir, this is the fortune of war.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p>Had I been made your prisoner, whilst on a post of duty, I could have borne my lot—A soldier can support not only death, but even slavery, when a sense of duty gives <hi>dignity</hi> to his chains; but <hi>my</hi> chains are base ones, for I reconnoiter'd without command, and have lost my liberty without glory.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Then <hi>I</hi> have lost my liberty too without glory, for I <hi>attended</hi> you without command, and now— Oh, <hi>le diable!</hi> I am valet de chambre to a slave!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TURK.</speaker>
<p>Let not that affect thee! The fortune of war, which has wounded your master's pride, ought to
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
elate yours, for you are now his equal—both slaves alike.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Eagerly.]</stage>
Are we so? And has he no farther right to command me, nor threaten me? Kind Sir, tell me but that—tell me but that —!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TURK.</speaker>
<p>None, none.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Hum!
<stage>[Puts his hat on, takes out his snuff-box, takes snuff, then goes to his master, and offers his box.]</stage>
Take a pinch, don't be shy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p>Scoundrel!
<stage>[Throws up the box with his arm.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Nay, no hard names—let us be civil to each other, as brother slaves ought to be—And now I think of it—Hark ye! I suppose your slaves take rank according to their usefulness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TURK.</speaker>
<p>Certainly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Well then, my master—I mean that man there, who was my master, can do no earthly thing but fight, whilst I, on the contrary, am expert at several.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MULEY.</speaker>
<p>Your qualifications?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>They are innumerable—I can sing you pretty little French airs, and Italian canzonettas—No man in Paris, Sir—for I have the honor to be a Frenchman—No man in Paris understands the science of the powder-puff better than myself—I can frize you in a taste beyond—Oh, what you are all CROPS, I see—fore fronts, and back fronts—Oh, those vile turbans, my genius will be lost amongst you, and a frizeur will be of no more use than an oyster-woman.—Why, you look as though you had all been scalp'd, and cover'd your crowns with your pillows.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
<speaker>TURK.</speaker>
<p>Christian, our turbans are too elevated a subject for your sport.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Dear Sir,
<stage>[pointing to his turban, and then to the ground]</stage>
drop the subject, it will be a proof of national taste.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MULEY.</speaker>
<p>Thy speech is licentious and empty; but in a Frenchman we can pardon it—'tis <hi>national Taste</hi>— However, if your boasted qualifications end here, it is probable, you will be a slave as little distinguish'd as your master.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Pardonnez moi! I can do things he never thought of—You have heard the story of the basket-maker amongst savages? I do not despair of seeing my master my servant yet—Courage, Monsieur Ie Compte! I'll treat you with great condescension, depend on't, and endeavour to make you forget in all things the distance between us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MULEY.</speaker>
<p>He seems too deeply absorb'd in melancholy, to be roused by thy impertinence!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Poor young man! Times are alter'd, to be sure; and at present he's a little down in the mouth; but he's fond of music, cheer him with a Turkish air— Helas! all the <hi>air</hi> we have will be Turkish now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p>Ah no! forbear your music, and bring me your chains! Drag me to your dungeons! The intellectual bitterness of this moment cannot be increased by <hi>outward</hi> circumstance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Chains and dungeons! Why sure the ghost of our dead bastille has not found its way hither— Hey, Messieurs! Have you lantern posts too, and hanging Marquisses in this country?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p><stage>[angrily.]</stage>
Peace!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Peace! That's a bold demand.—Your Empress can't find it at the head of a hundred thousand men, and the most sublime Grand Signior is obliged to put on his night-cap without it, though he has a million of these pretty Gentlemen to assist him—Besides, England has engross'd the commodity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p>Come, Sir, let us not loiter here—I would have my fate determined, and my misery compleat. Alas! is it not already so? Yes, my heart has been long the property of sorrow, and it will never relinquish its claims.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MULEY.</speaker>
<p>I shall lead you to the palace of the Bassa Ibrahim—it is in the neighbourhood of yonder camp which he commands, what your fate may then be, his humour determines.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Then I hope we shall catch him in a <hi>good</hi> humour, and what care I whether a Turk or a Ruffian has the honor to be my master? Now you see the misfortune of being born a Count! Had he lost no more than I have, he'd be as careless as I am—Come, brother slave—no ceremony, no ceremony, I beg.</p>

<p>To give brave soldiers an opportunity of running away with such pretty girls as you.</p>
</sp>

Such a wailing about freedom and liberty! why the christians in one of the northern islands have established a slave-trade, and proved by act of parliament that freedom is no blessing at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>No, no, they have only proved that it does not suit dark complexions. To such a pretty creature as this, they'd think it a blessing to <hi>give</hi> every freedom— and <hi>take</hi> every freedom.</p>

<p>Come, come, be gay and happy, like the rest of the slaves. How stands your mind to-day towards a

<p>O miserable speed! I go—Mustapha, on thy eloquence depends my breath—The moments of my life are number'd by thy success—Press fearlessly the cause of virtue, and glow with the sainted subject.</p>

<p>Why, as to chastity, and all that, which you make an orthodox article of, sweet one! we Turks are a sort of dissenters—a woman's virtue with us, is to CHARM, and her religion should be LOVE.—Ah, ah! here comes Ibrahim, and his whole haram—<hi>His</hi> creed is love, and there is not a more orthodox man in the country.</p>

<p>She just now run off on that side, and I shall run off on this—for I have not settled what to say about her, and BASSAS and TYGERS are animals not made to be trifled with.

<p>Well, let that pretty melancholy slave feel as she pleases—I, for my part, am half out of my wits, to think how happy we shall be now the Bassa is come back—we shall have nothing but whim and entertainment.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>We rejoice in our lord's return, that her pride may be humbled.—The insolence of her carriage, and the perverseness of her temper, are intolerable.</p>

<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Thou hast seen her, Muley, does she justify Azim's description?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>She is reserved, my lord, reserved and melancholy—but she is too gentle to be insolent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Muley knows her not—Canst thou believe it, mighty Bassa, the idea of surrend'ring her charms to thee, and of being raised to the honour of thy notice, has never once soften'd her ill humour, nor abated her melancholy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!
<stage>[Angrily]</stage>
Bring her to me instantly—yes, instantly bid her come to my presence, and tell her—No—hold—I will receive her in my hall of audience, dazzle her with my greatness, and astonish her into love.</p>

<p>Dost thou speak truth, my pretty Italian?— Thy country is the country of love, and thou should'st be an adept in the science.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAUR.</speaker>
<p>Yes; I know the history of the heart, and do assure you, that you must become the slave of your captive, if you ever mean to taste the sublime excesses of a mutual passion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p><stage>[contemptuously]</stage>
Mutual passion! Sir, she is your slave, <hi>command</hi> her! Such baseness may befit an Italian, but a mussulman is more sensible to his dignity.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>I will hear you both further on the subject— The iron labour of the war is for a few weeks suspended —and during that cessation, Pleasure! I am thine. Prepare your banquets, compose new delights, let every hour teem with fresh invented joys, till I forget the toils of the sanguinary field, and bathe my wounds with rosy-finger'd love.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FAT.</speaker>
<p>Well, he's in delightful spirits—But how strange it is that the Russian slave shou'd not have presented herself to welcome her master, and to give him an impression of her charms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAUR.</speaker>
<p>Stranger if she had, when nothing frightens her so much as the idea of inspiring him with a passion —I am interested for her, and it is for this reason I shall endeavour to make Ibrahim pursue a conduct not usual from a mighty mussulman to his slave.

<p>Azim, since I saw thee last, I have trod the paths of glory—I have slumbered amidst the frosts of the night, I have toil'd amidst the streams of burning day; but I return and find thee the same.—With me all things have chang'd, but thou art unalter'd.— Thy temper, like the deep shadow of the forest, is sometimes chequer'd by the dart of the angry lightning, but the serene cheerfulness of the morning dwells not with thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Well, and what then? If you like me not, thwart me not. There's room enough in Turkey for thee and for me.—Let the crow and the vulture rest on the same tree; but may thou and I live as far apart as the streams of Ilyssus, and the waters of the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>The enemy of our faith.</p>

<p>The enemy of those only who oppose the interests of my sovereign—To chastize them I this morning bore a sword which your slaves won from me, hardly! Let them consider it as the noblest acquisition of the day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Christian, this air of intrepidity, when amidst the soldiers of the Russian camp, might have suited thy

condition; thou art now a slave thyself, acquire then that humility which becomes thy state.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p>Dishonourable! I demand my liberty.— A truce has been proclaim'd, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Not till after thou wert captured; thou art, therefore, by the laws of arms, fairly our prisoner.— Give him the slave's habit, and set him to labour. Who art <hi>thou?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Not a Russian, dear Sir, 'pon my honour, nor the enemy of your faith; I believe it's a very genteel faith, and I have all the respect in the world for Turkish gentlemen.—I never saw prettier behav'd, prettier dress'd people in my life—they have as much politeness and good breeding as tho' they were my own countrymen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Of what country are thou?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Paris, Sir, Paris. I travell'd into Russia to polish the brutes a little, and to give them some ideas of the general equality of man; but my generosity has been lost;—they still continue to believe that a prince is more than a porter, and that a lord is a better gentleman than his slave. O, had they but been with me at Versailles, when I help'd to turn those things topsey turvey there!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Did you find them equally dull in other respects?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Yes. Finding they would not learn liberty, I would have taught them dancing, but they seem'd as incapable of one blessing as the other; so, now <hi>I</hi> am led a dance by this gentleman
<stage>[turning to his master]</stage>
into your chains, in which, if I can but dance

myself into your favour, I shall think it the best <hi>step</hi> I ever took.</p>

Yes, I think, I think that may do—Muley, and the other four, with our little Mustapha—Yes, yes; with these half dozen, I'll weave a webb of amusement to crack the sides of a dozen gloomy harems with laughter—Mercy! what a sleepy life wou'd our valiant Bassa and his damsels lead, but for my talents at invention.

Yes, yes; as to insolence, match me her fellow if you can—Bless us, to see the difference! Why, my Lord, our Eastern beauties are so gentle, so complying, they scarcely give you time to wish</p>

<p>Pretty creatures! if a man does but look at them, they drop like a ripe cherry from the bough— No coldness, no disdain; but as to this proud Russian, it would be easier to march an army to St. Petersburgh, and whip the Empress through a keyhole into your baggage waggon, than to subdue her petulance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Dost thou think so? Oh, ev'ry word thou utterest gives new ardor to my hopes, new impulses to my desires—I adore her.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>Alack! alack!
<stage>[<hi>with surprize</hi>].</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Mustapha, my imagination paints her her till my heart grows sick with love! I see the beauteous scorner dart living lightnings from her eye, and her cheek glow with chaste disdain; I weep in anguish at her feet, I implore her compassion—Melted with my love, yet still rigid and reserv'd, I behold the bewitching conflict in her soul—I triumph in the discovery, yet conceal my delight, still implore, still complain, then seize some happy instant, when her whole soul is touch'd, and boast a victory indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>What then—What then, my Lord, you are not displeas'd at her haughtiness?</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Go on to paint her—pencil her in all her fascinating pride, deck her in the coldness which dwells on the polar Alp! My glowing soul shall burn at the description, and blaze with the fierceness of newly tasted love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>Why, as to that—to be sure as to that, she is as cold as the Alps, and all their snow-balls—she perfectly make's one's teeth chatter at her.—But then—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>What?
<stage>[impatiently]</stage>
then what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>Why, if truth must be spoke, there is, after all, something oddish about her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Oddish!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>Why now, my Lord, look at me—pray look at me—Ay, my Lord Bassa, examine me well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>To what purpose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>Why, the ladies of your harem say that this same beautiful Russian is exceedingly like me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Ridiculous!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>Particularly about the nose.
<stage>[Ibra. <hi>shews impatience</hi>]</stage>
Nay, there are handsome likenesses, my Lord—I don't say but that she may be rather handsomer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Thou art mad.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>Not that ever I saw the likeness myself—except something in the shape indeed—But there I have the advantage, for her right shoulder, and her right ear, have too right an understanding, they are always together. Then her hair, to be sure it may suit some people, but according to my fancy, the colour is execrable.</p>

<p>Ay, that's because you did not grasp her fast —Treat Hope as you would a favourite lover, Lady! never lose sight of it.</p>

<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>Thou art light!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>Even so is hope—as light as one of your own country rein-deer—and to carry on the comparison, it will whisk you <hi>like</hi> a rein-deer over all the bitter frosts of life: Buckle hope to your sledge, and you will travel over the tiresome waste, disdaining the blast, and smiling at the tempest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>O that I could <hi>seize</hi> her! But how is it possible within these walls? These walls, the temple of loose desires, the abode of a tyrant and his slaves? Mustapha! could'st thou effect my escape?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>There indeed, hope will give you the slip— for I could as easily escape into the air, and pluck a feather from the flying eagle, as help you in that, and to tell you the truth, my master will not much longer be dallied with.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>Dreadful words! Thou canst not guess at their weight—a tumbling rock to crush this worthless frame, would not,—could not give me half the horror.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>She frightens me—her eye is wild!</p>

<p>I do swear to thee,—THEE! to whom my fruitless vows were paid, never to forget that I am thine —never to suffer the slightest violation of our sacred love.—This

<p>So! then we shall have some other females, fate willing to plague us.

<p>Well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>About two months ago, Mr. Slave-driver, he was married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>A pretty girl faith, and daughter to one of our great Russian boyards—a boyard ranks as a marquis did in France, and as a laird still does in Scotland —I love to elucidate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>So, Sir, a few hours after the ceremony, before the sun was gone down, and before the moon had thought about dressing herself for the evening— Whip! his pretty bride was gone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Where?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="30" facs="36"/>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>That's the very thing he would get at. —Ma'am and he were walking like two doves in the boyard's garden, which garden was border'd by trees, which trees were border'd by the sea—Out springs from the wood forty Turks with forty sabres, and forty pair of great monstrous whiskers, which so frighten'd the bride, that, instead of running away, she fainted away, and staid there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Hah, hah! then my countrymen had a prize.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>That they had, worth two Jew's eyes. Six of them hurried off with her to a Felucca, which lay at the edge of the wood; and all the rest employ'd my master. I suppose they would have had him too, but the boyard, with a large party of friends, appearing at the top of a walk, they thought fit to make off with what they had.—Well, my master's bridal bed was, that night, the beach, where he staid raving and beating himself, as tho' he took himself for one of the Turkish ravishers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! thy story is well—so, all that night, he walk'd in the garden—Oh, and the nightingales, I warrant, sung responses to his complaints, and the melancholy wood dove cooed in sympathetic sorrow.—It must have been very pleasant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>O, a pleasant night as could be; but it cost him a fortnight's lying in bed; for a hissing hot fever laid hold of him; and the doctors, with all their rank and file of phials and bolusses, could hardly drive him out of his veins.</p>
</sp>

<p>Go! you are an idle rascal, and would rather talk an hour than work a minute—Go, or I will draw some of thy French blood to balance accounts with your master.</p>

<stage>[Azim lashes him off.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>The time he mentions, about two months, is about the period when our Felucca landed Alexina, and his account tallies exactly with the account of the sailors—Aye, it must be so—Now, would it <hi>add</hi> to her misery to know that her husband is so near her? I must consider, and she shall either know it, or not, according to the effect which I think it will produce.—I know she hates me, and let her look to it.</p>

<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p>Inflict your punishments! to those I can submit, but not to labour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Why not? Has Nature made any distinction between you and the rest of the slaves? Look at
<pb n="32" facs="38"/>
yourself, Sir!—Your form, your limbs, your habit! are they in aught different from the rest?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p><stage>[haughtily]</stage>
BIRTH has made a distinction!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>That I deny—The plea of birth is of all others the most shadowy. There, at least, Nature has been strictly impartial: the son of an Empress receives life on the same terms with the son of a peasant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p>Pride then, and Fortune, make distinctions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>True; but Fortune has deserted you, and pray recommend it to your pride to follow her, that you may, without trouble, attend to your business.—Here! take the spade.</p>

<p>Now, if the Bassa had not commanded me to be gentle to him, I would have beaten him with thongs till his broken spirit brought him to my feet for mercy: but if I can't bend it, I'll torture it.

Oh! speak to me, tell me if thou know'st her—Nay, turn not from me!—All the lineaments of thy face become important— if thou wilt not speak to me, let me gaze on <hi>them,</hi> and there gather my fate.</p>

<sp>
<pb n="33" facs="39"/>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Well, gaze and gaze! Can'st thou there read her story? Dost thou know <hi>whether</hi> she breathes, and <hi>where?</hi> Dost thou behold thy lovely wife triumphant in a seraglio, or submissive in a bathing house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p>Oh, villain! monster! neither. By every glittering star in heaven, if she lives, she's chaste!
<stage>[pauses, and strikes his forehead]</stage>
Had I gold and jewels, I would pour the treasure at thy feet, but now have mercy on me—Oh, I beseech thee, tell me if Alexina lives.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! if Alexina lives!
<stage>[laughs again, then walks slowly off.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Nay, thou shalt not avoid me—I will pursue thee, kneel at thy feet, perform the most menial offices, so thou wilt tell me of my Alexina!</p>

Now, where are the distinctions of thy birth? Do they prevent thy feeling like the vulgarest son of Nature?</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ALEXINA,
[hastily.]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>Nay, but it is—Impossible! And yet it is so! Art thou not Paulina, the daughter of my father's vassal, Petrowitz?—Alas! thou art. Unhappy girl! what—</p>

<p>Goodness, goodness! If it is not the Lady Alexina, may I be whipt!</p>

<p>Dear Paulina, what dreadful destiny brought thee hither?</p>

<sp>
<pb n="37" facs="43"/>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>Destiny do you call him?
<stage>[looking at Mustapha]</stage>
Why, this place is all full of dreadful destinies, I think. Some with black whiskers, and some with grey ones. Was it this little odd destiny who bought you too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>Alas! thy question brings back such a rush of sorrows—Oh! thou can'st not be ignorant that I was torn from my husband within the very hour that made me his,
<stage>[weeps]</stage>
and dragg'd from bliss to slavery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>I did not know that you was <hi>here</hi>—but I am monstrous glad to meet you here—It is the luckiest thing—I have always been in luck!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MUS.</speaker>
<p>Yes, that compliment is a proof of it. You are vastly lucky there! Well, go on, and amuse her, child—I shall enlarge your party presently.
<stage>[Goes out.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>The little body is as pert as though it was five feet high—But, for all him, I will say, my dear lady, that I would not but have seen you here for the best gown I have—Not even for this, though it is so fine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>Hah, Paulina! I fear that this dress is the mark of thy dishonor—I fear thou art undone!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>Undone indeed! I think we are both undone; to be brought into such an odd, out-of-the-way country as this—ha, ha, ha, ha. I have been here but an hour, and it seems an hundred—In one place a parcel of copper-colour creatures, without tongues, pop out, glaring with their sawcer eyes, and if you want to talk and be a little sociable, ba, ba, ba, is all you can get—I believe they learnt their alphabet of the sheep—Then in another corner—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="38" facs="44"/>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p><stage>[impatiently]</stage>
Pray reserve your observations —I have questions to ask, which tear my heart-strings to pronounce—Speak to me of Orloff—Oh, my Orloff! Speak to me of my parents.—Did they <hi>support</hi> the moment which dragg'd me from them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>Truly as bad as you cou'd wish.—At last 't was said that my Lord, the Count, went into the army, and there he has play'd about him valiantly! I warrant he'll pay the Turks for robbing him of you, though, may be, they won't like his coin.</p>

<p>Here, I have brought ye Lauretta; she is a girl of enterprize, and I have a fancy which her intriguing spirit will bring to perfection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>Alas! how can she serve me? Can she restore me to my country—to my husband—?</p>
</sp>

<stage>[To Pau. who is in his way.]</stage></p>
</sp>

<p>Aye, on any side but your's, Mr. Destiny

<sp>
<speaker>LAUR.</speaker>
<p>Dear madam, look a little cheerfully—I have a thought in my head—Hark ye, my dear
<stage>[to Paulina]</stage>
—you are a Russian, I find—What sort of lovers do your countrymen make?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="39" facs="45"/>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>How should I know? I never had but three —One was old enough to be my father, so, I used to kneel down and ask his blessing—So, one day, he gave me a curse, and walked off.—The next was a schoolmaster, and he had such a trick of correction, that, had I married him, I should have been in constant fear of the birch.—The third was a soldier—but as I neither liked to follow the camp, nor to live a widow bewitch'd, I made him beat his march.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAUR.</speaker>
<p>Brava! you dispos'd of them all like a girl of spirit, and yet, I think, had the case been mine, I should have taken a march with the soldier—I do love soldiers.—A regiment on its march always makes my heart shiver to pieces amongst a thousand Caesars and Alexanders,
<stage>[To Alexina.]</stage>
Has the Bassa seen you yet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>He sent by Muley to command me to his presence, but I will first rush into the arms of death.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAUR.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! such a resolution in this country! Rather rush into the arms of death, than into the arms of a handsome lover! the notion is exotic— it is an ice-plant of the North—and our hot sun will wither its honours, depend on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAUR.</speaker>
<p>Ah, pardon my levity, for I mean to serve you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>In <hi>you,</hi> the contented inhabitant of a seraglio, such profanation may be pardon'd; but alas! in the world, the grace of chastity is scarcely longer
<pb n="40" facs="46"/>
acknowledged! I have heard the wife and the daughter affix ridicule to the name. O virtue! where canst thou expect worship, when the speech of the matron and the virgin <hi>unhallows</hi> thy sacred idea?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAUR.</speaker>
<p>I am not so lost, but I can feel and <hi>thank</hi> you for your reproof; and as the first fruits of it, I will labour for your escape from a situation, which, to you, must be misery indeed! But, madam, we must confer alone—I intreat you to retire with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>Alas! so miserable is my situation, that I am obliged to accept services from those whom the feelings of my heart wou'd impel me to shun.</p>

Ah! not so quick, miss! Do you stay here 'till I return—Stir not, I charge you.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>Stay here, indeed! There is pretty good care taken that one shou'dn't run away. The walls are as high as a cathedral, and such frightful looking oddities prowling about, that a mouse could not run from one shrub to another without observation—How they all stare at me! So! there's another of them— He looks rather better than the rest—but I shall have nothing to say to him.

And now for my reward! Now will I seek the charming obdurate, nor ever leave—

<p>Heigho! what shall I do with myself! I'll gather flowers for lady Alexina.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Yes, she has a thousand charms, and my heart is already in her chains.—How dared Mustapha deceive me? He talked of deformity—her form is symmetry itself, and her hair which he decried, is fit for the bow-strings of the god of love.</p>

I was out of this wretched place altogether, I know that.</p>

<p>It shall be the business of my life to make you happy in it.</p>

Your haughtiness I was prepared to bow to, but I know not how to meet your contempt.</p>

<p>Don't begin to redden at me—I mind ye no more than I do this sallow leaf—There—see—I blow it, and away it flies—go after it—there lies your way.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>But not the attraction—You bid me go, whilst your eyes chain me here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>Then I'll shut them—There—now how do you like me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>In vain you shut your eyes, unless you cou'd likewise hide that rosy mouth, those teeth, those features, that form! I could love you though you were blind.</p>

<p>Love! What, can you love? Such a hardhearted—<hi>Turkish</hi>—creature as you love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Can I? yes, to distraction! It is not possible for me to tell you <hi>how</hi> I could adore you— Whole days wou'd be lost in gazing on your charms! I could hang on your breath like the humming-bird on the vapour of the rose, and I should drink your glances, 'till my soul, sick with excess of pleasure,

would leave me scarce power to murmur forth my bliss.</p>

<p>Ah, you sweet little saucy jade, come under the wall, and blow me a kiss—You won't! Why get along then, you ill-humour'd baggages—Hah! what, you look back, do you? You'd better think on't, and turn—What, the grapes are sour, are they? Ah, ah! I understand you—this is a fine place for the gypsies, hang me if it is not—These Turks have a life on't—Such fine girls, and such fine gardens— Whu! who comes here? This is another—Yes, yes, I'll turn Turk—There's nothing like it, I see.</p>

<p><stage>[Clapping her hands.]</stage>
As sure as that impudent head was once on the shoulders of A la Greque; who ever thought of seeing it on the top of a Turkish wall? How came you amongst them? Did they buy you too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Buy me! No, I was taken fighting in a little skirmish, where I had only time to disarm half a dozen Turks, and kill a few Bassas; and now the cowardly rogues have shut me up here, for fear I should do them further mischief—I believe they think I have a design upon the crown.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>Law! only think of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Didn't you hear that the Grand Turk had offer'd a reward for my head?</p>

<speaker>PAU.</speaker>
<p>A man a bullfinch, ha, ha, ha! These stupid creatures might be persuaded, I dare say, that a cat was a green slipper. Well, how oddly things turn out!—Little does lady Alexina think her husband is so near her.—Hist! A la Greque! A la Greque!—
<stage>[Looking towards the top of the wall]</stage>
—Psha! he's gone now—Well, I'll run and bless her with the news, and then take one more lesson for my behaviour to the Bassa.—I shall be able, after that, to behave as proudly as though my father were a noble of the land—Let me see—How is it to be a fine lady? First, I must disguise all the feelings of my heart—But how can I do so without telling fibs? Well, fine ladies don't mind that▪—Second, when he kneels, I must turn from

him, or hum a tune—thus—
<stage>[hums]</stage>
—Did you speak to me, Sir?—And when the charming man—O Lord! I shall never do it, as though I were us'd to it— When he attempts to kiss me, I must complain of his insolence, and walk away in this manner.

<p>Shall we stand by each other, brothers? Will you be faithful?</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Well then, you see how the case stands; she is come wonderfully into favour, and will, without doubt, be reveng'd on us, for the severities she receiv'd in our lord's absence. The Bassa has just now threaten'd vengeance to all who displease her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SLAVE.</speaker>
<p>Will it not displease her then to be put into a prison?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>'Tis likely it may—but what is that to us? We can, whenever we determine to do so, connive at her escape; and if we allow her to leave the palace, she'll readily pardon the prison; so, she'll be gratified, and we shall be skreen'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ISM.</speaker>
<p>Well, well; let her be locked up as you said, and then persuade him she has escaped.</p>

<speaker>AZIM.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and that old tower will be a proper place to confine her in; then, if need be, she can hereafter be produced, for I don't entirely approve of poisoning her.</p>

<p>No, not at present—it may be more convenient hereafter—

—Where shall we seize her?</p>

<p>Here's some one coming.</p>

<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Well, a <hi>wall</hi>—What is a <hi>wall</hi> to me?</p>

<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p>Could I, each morning, when I greet its rays, behold but thee, I could bear to live even in this wretched state, and every heavy night I could creep to my straw pallet with less despondency, having first receiv'd from thy sweet eyes, farewell!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>To be sure the wall is a high wall, and a strong wall; but it is <hi>but</hi> a wall.</p>

<p>If thou darest mention the wall again.</p>

<p>Well, I won't then; but was I to tell you, my Lord, what that wall contains, I really believe you'd forgive all my sauciness for ten years to come.</p>

<p>Then, my Lord, there, as sure as you lost your bride on the day of marriage, there I saw the fair Paulina, daughter of old Petrowitz.</p>

<p>Oh!

<p>Mon Dieu! if the joy of that has been too much for him, how would he have borne it, if I had seen his wife?

<p>So! what he is <hi>disappointed</hi> then! Why if he would but have had patience, I was just going to tell him that his wife—but hang patience! 'tis a scurvy virtue, and not fit for a gentleman. <hi>I</hi> have no patience to know there are so many fine girls caged up here for that <hi>greedy</hi> DOG the Bassa. I'll try to pick a bone with him, though;—and if I can once lay hold of one of his pullets, he shall find it as difficult to get her out of my fangs, as it would be to make a judge dance, or a bishop cut capers.

by the roots, and its fruits are devour'd by disappointment.</p>

<p>Mighty Lord! is not the beauteous slave within thy power?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Within my power! No, she is removed from it for ever. As my slave, I have undoubted right over her; but as the wife of another, she is sacred.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MULEY.</speaker>
<p>Then remove her from your presence, and give her back to her adoring husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Never! O virtue, in exacting that, thy commands are too rigorous. Never, never can I send her from me—I will go this moment, and at her feet —Oh, I dare not—If I see her I am lost—All barriers, human and divine, wou'd sink before me—Beholding her within my grasp, and the dread of losing her, would be a conflict in which <hi>I</hi> shou'd be lost, and <hi>she</hi> would be undone! I fly from her—I tear myself from the sweet enchantment—Oh wretched husband, I assume voluntarily the miseries I have bestow'd on thee!</p>

<p>What! run away from the woman he loves, when she is in his power! She is <hi>his,</hi> and I would force her to make me happy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MULEY.</speaker>
<p>His generous spirit would abhor the deed! What, though his passions are headstrong as the mighty north, which shakes the pyramid to its base, and lifts the rooted forest from the embracing earth, yet will REFLECTION like a celestial minister arrive, and courge from his soul each spot and sordid tint, that virtue ought to scorn, or manhood blush at.

<p>Hah! slaves and lights! perhaps they come to end my wretched being—Ah! nature shrinks at the idea, and whilst I almost dread to live, I fly from death, by impulse irresistible!</p>

<p>There, Sir! Here you must stay till our master hath determined on the <hi>sort</hi> of death you are to die, for we have great variety in this country. This bowstring is the easiest you can hope for. We'll leave you a lamp though, to shew the apartments, and make your last hours a little pleasant—Wish your honor a good night.
<stage>Exeunt slaves.</stage></p>

<p>May this hour of bitterness be short! Here, on the flinty earth I'll pass it, and give to thee— <hi>despair!</hi> the fleeting moments that remain.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>What wretch can he be, who, in this dreary place, is the victim of tyranny and despotism?
<stage>[Advancing, and looking over him.]</stage>
By every sacred power it <hi>is</hi> my husband! Orloff—
<stage>[seizing his hand]</stage>
my Orloff!
<stage>[He starts up, throws her off, and flies to the opposite side.]</stage>
Dost thou distrust thy senses? It is thy Alexina—thy wretched—happy Alexina!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p>Abandon'd woman! dost thou follow me to my prison to insult my last moments? Or dost thou come to administer the bowl of death?</p>

<p>Heavens! what mean you?
<stage>(<hi>rushing towards him with open arms.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>

<p>Nay, touch me not—By heav'n, rather than be enfolded in thy adulterous embrace, I'll—
<stage>[draws a dagger]</stage>
O, my thoughts are desperate! Avoid me if thou would'st live.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>Alas! affliction has made him mad.</p>

<p>Oh!

</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="79" facs="85"/>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>Or if thou art not mad, to threaten death is needless. Be witness for me, ye celestial spirits, that I'll not live an instant to endure a husband's hate —All other miseries I've borne, but this last subdues me.
<stage>[snatches up the dagger]</stage>
Thou accusest me of crimes I shudder at—Orloff, an adultress would not dare this blow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p><stage>[springs forward, and seizes her arm]</stage>
Die! Yes, thou ought'st to die; but let <hi>my</hi> fate come first—It lingers not—its ministers are at hand!

O, had I not seen thee in his arms, had I not heard thy vows of never-ending love to the tyrant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Interrupting eagerly.]</stage>
My vows! ah, my Orloff, a beam of radiance once more breaks in on my afflicted soul. I have never <hi>seen</hi> the Bassa—Nay, look not thus incredulous—this dungeon proves it— I am a prisoner here as well as you, and was this day brought hither.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Gazing wildly.]</stage>
Oh fate, spare me a moment! Scarcely dare I give way to the overpowering thought! yet it must be so! It was not thee, <hi>my heaven!</hi> whom I beheld in Ibrahim's arms—No, it was another, and Alexina's pure!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>As pure as at that sacred hour, when at the altar you receiv'd my virgin vows; and heaven is witness, that this form has ne'er been press'd in any arms but thine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLOFF.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Clasping her.]</stage>
Then art thou dearer in these prison walls, dearer in this thy faded beauty, than when a blaze of charms o'erpower'd my senses, beneath the haughty dome where first I woo'd thee.</p>

<sp>
<pb n="80" facs="86"/>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<p>How matchless is the power of virtuous love! Having thus seen thee, having thus once again been press'd to thy fond bosom, I am prepar'd for death.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Valiant Russian, I embrace thee! The poniard you directed to my breast, had it enter'd there, would have pierc'd a heart, which, amidst the turbulencies of war, and the infatuations of a court, has yet preserv'd its OWN RESPECT;—accept its friendship!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>IBRA.</speaker>
<p>Such charms, I could not have beheld insensibly,
<stage>[to Alexina]</stage>
had I known them before Paulina engrossed my heart—but now, that heart can beat for her alone. To-morrow you shall be escorted to your camp, and I, to give that dignity to love, without which it sinks into lowest appetite, will make this charmer mine, by sacred rites.</p>

I am once again your most duteous servant—for <hi>fellow slaves,</hi> I perceive, we shall be no longer—So there goes my dignity! I'll make a bold push for a new one though. Azim, I find—pardon me, my lord,

Azim, I find, is out of place, will your mightiness bestow it on me, and make me your principal slavedriver?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>A LA GR.</speaker>
<p>Any thing, and every thing. I'd imitate the smack of Azim's whip, and roll my eyes as he does, to frighten your <hi>male</hi> slaves, and transform myself into a sattin seat, with a canopy over my head, to amuse your <hi>female</hi> slaves.</p>
</sp>

<p>Transform thyself into a sattin seat, with a canopy over thy head—thou art bewildered.
