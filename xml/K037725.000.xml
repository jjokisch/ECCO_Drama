<p>HE'S MUCH TO BLAME, A COMEDY: IN FIVE ACTS.</p>
<p>AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, COVENT GARDEN.</p>
<p>LONDON: PRINTED FOR G. G. AND J. ROBINSON, PATERNOSTER ROW.</p>
<p>MDCCXCVIII.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="note">
<pb facs="2"/>
<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THE author of HE'S MUCH TO BLAME is in some small degree indebted to Le Complaisant, a comedy attributed to Monsieur De Ferriol Pont-de-Veyle, and to the tragedy of Clavigo by Goethe.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="prologue">
<pb facs="3"/>
<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>PROLOGUES, in these sagacious days, must not</l>
<l>Repeat the story; and betray the plot:</l>
<l>For deep laid plots we sometimes have, no doubt:</l>
<l>'Tis pity you can't always find them out:</l>
<l>The secret must be kept; and not be told:</l>
<l>In this, at least, we beat the bards of old:</l>
<l>We can't endure our meaning you should guess,</l>
<l>And here again we boast complete success:</l>
<l>Cautious lest you the mystery should discover,</l>
<l>We keep you in the dark—till all is over.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Since these important points we must not name,</l>
<l>The title let's discuss: He's much▪to blame!</l>
<l>To blame? Ay, surely; very much! But who.</l>
<l>The author. Well, that's nothing very new.</l>
<l>And what does blame induce? Why punishment.</l>
<l>Rashly we sin and leisurely repent.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Lured by that tempting bait a nine nights' bonus,</l>
<l>These scribbling sinners multiply upon us!</l>
<l>Then prologues write; to whine, cajole, and tickle:</l>
<l>Begging you'll burn the rod you've laid in pickle.</l>
<l>Shielding himself by these and such like arts,</l>
<l>He hopes to hurl with surer aim his darts.</l>
<l>But strike and cry, when we receive a blow,</l>
<l>Is arrant cowardice! I told him so.</l>
<l>He's mad, who would the field of battle tread;</l>
<l>Unless he hoped to have a broken head.</l>
<l>There's honor in such scars—he'll win and wear it▪</l>
<l>Then give him honor plenty! Never spare it.</l>
<l>But, should it be your pleasure not to quarrel,</l>
<l>He'll very kindly bear his load of laurel.</l>

<p>"Dear sister, The letter I now write is almost needless, for I shall leave Italy and follow it immediately; having at last obtained intelligence of your faithless lover. I am sorry to inform you that, in addition to your unpardonable wrongs, I have my own to vindicate. But I have threatened too long. You have heard of the Earl of Vibrate. He and his family are by this arrived in England; your betrayer accompanies them, and I am in close pursuit. PAUL DELAVAL."</p>
<p>In what will this end? Must they meet? Must they fight? Must one or both of them fall? Oh horror! Shall I be the cause of murder? And whose blood is to be spilled?

<p>Thank you, my good friend. But how is this? Where is the family? Where is Lady Jane?</p>

<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THOM.</speaker>
<p>I knew, when Lady Jane left Italy, your stay there would be short.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay! The follies and frenzies of the madman are visible to all eyes, except his own.</p>

<speaker>THOM.</speaker>
<p>I see you are dissatisfied.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Tortured, till my thoughts and temper are so changed that I am almost as odious to myself as the world is become hateful to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THOM.</speaker>
<p>I own, you have some cause.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Would <hi>my</hi> injuries were all! But there are other and still deeper stabs. It is not yet ten months since I returned from India: my heart how light, my eve how cheerful, and my hand prompt at any commendable act. I could then be moved to joy, and sorrow, and every sympathising passion. Smiles and mock courtesy passed current on me, the word of man and woman was taken on trust, and I lived in the sunshine of an open unsuspecting soul. But I am now otherwise taught. I am changed. My better part is brutalized; and the wrongs that lie rankling here have stripped me of human affections, and made me almost savage.</p>

<p>What can be said? Patience is the—</p>
</sp>

<p>Shall I inform his lordship of your arrival?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>By no means. Having injured, he may wish not to see me: and I would not afford him time to invent excuses, and avoid giving me a hearing. Though my wrongs must be endured, they shall be told.</p>

<p>I own, they are great.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Those that you know are heavy; yet, severe as the struggle would be, 'tis possible they might be hushed to rest: but there are others▪ which blood only can obliterate! which can only sleep in death!

<p>THE ancient sceptics doubted of every thing, affirmed nothing, and kept the judgment always in suspense: All things, said they, are equally indifferent, uncertain, and indeterminate. The mind is never to assent to any thing; that it may never be astonished, or disturbed, but enjoy

a perfect calm. <stage>(Rises with important wisdom in his looks)</stage> Such were the maxims of Pyrrho, and his disciples; those renowned sages of antiquity! Well! And such too have been my maxims, practically. All my life have I been wavering, uncertain, and indeterminate! A sagacious sceptic without knowing it; and as it were by instinct! It was but lately I discovered what a wise man I am! And yet it seems to me as if I were scarcely half wise enough, for I am told that I am to doubt of every thing which I find rather difficult. For example: that my wife Lady Vibrate is an extravagant rackety rantipole woman of fashion, can I doubt that? No. That she squanders my money, disturbs my peace, and contradicts for contradiction's sake, can I doubt that? No. Then have I not a daughter to marry, a law suit to begin, and a thousand perplexing affairs so that I do not know which way to turn? Why all this appears true to me: but the sceptics teach that appearances deceive, and that nothing is certain. I may be Lord Vibrate, or I may be the Grand Turk. These doctrines are prodigiously deep. <stage>(Considers)</stage> But I must think of something else just now. I have a thousand things to do, and know as little where to begin as where they will end. Ay! All is uncertainty! <stage>(Rings)</stage> Harry! Edward!</p>

<head>SCENE VI. <stage><hi>Enter</hi> LADY VIBRATE.</stage></head>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Upon my honor, my lord, you are the most insupportable person imaginable. You vociferate worse than the man who calls when my carriage stops the way. Is any body dying? Is the house on fire? Is the world at an end?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>By the life your ladyship leads, I should suppose it is pretty near.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>You always give me such shocking head-achs of a morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>You always give me such shocking heart-achs of an evening.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Did not I send to you last night, to request your lordship would not disturb me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>It has been your ladyship's amusement to disturb me all your life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Your lordship knows I love amusement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>I have not slept a wink since.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>You had slept quite enough before. Pray how long are we to remain in this hotel? Your lordship should remember, it is degrading for a man of rank to doze away life, in the stile of a colonel reduced to half pay.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Your ladyship should remember, it is degrading for a woman of rank to riot away life, and reduce her creditors to live without pay.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! That is the old story.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>But it is a very true story. It is a great misfortune that persons so opposite should pair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>A terrible one indeed. I am all gaiety and good humour: you are all turmoil and lamentation. I sing, laugh, and welcome pleasure
<pb n="27" facs="27"/>
wherever I find it: you take your lantern to look for misery, which the sun itself cannot discover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>I am overwhelmed by crosses and vexations; and you participate in none of them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>No. Heaven be praised!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Will you attend to me, my lady, for half an hour?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Mercy! Attend to you for half an hour! You, my lord, may think proper to be as miserable as Job: but I am not Job's wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>I insist, Lady Vibrate, on a serious answer. How ought I to act? What should I do, in this law affair?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>I cannot tell what you ought to do: but I know what you will do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Do you? What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>The recovery of this property would enable me to give my daughter a portion suitable to her rank. If it is lost, she will be almost destitute of fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>You should have thought of that before, my lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Before? Why I have thought of nothing else for years. I have asked every body's advice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>

<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, my lord, if I intrude with too little ceremony. Something I hope will be allowed to a mind much disturbed, and a heart deeply wounded and impatient to ease its pangs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Which way deeply wounded, Mr. Delaval?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Can your lordship ask? Was it not with your permission I paid my addresses to Lady Jane? And was the ardour of my affection or the extent of my hopes unknown?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="31"/>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Why, I did permit, and I did not. I had my doubts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>My visits were daily, their purpose was declared, and I should imagine I spoke more respectfully to say that you permitted than that you connived at them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>True: but still I had my doubts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Those doubts have stung me to the soul; and I could wish you had expressed them more decidedly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Impossible! Doubts here, doubts there, doubts every where. No rational man can be decided, on any point whatever. My doubts are my continual plagues: my whole life is consumed by them,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>It appears, my lord, you have conquered them on one subject.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Ay indeed! I wish to heaven I had! What subject is that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>You have affianced your daughter to Sir George Versatile.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Humph!—Yes; and no. I have; and I have not. I cannot determine. Sir George is a prudent man, his estate is large, and the Versatiles are an ancient race. But your family is ancient, you are prudent, and the wealth left by your uncle is at least equal. What can I say? What can I do? I don't know which to take nor which to refuse. I am everlastingly in these difficulties. I am harassed night and day by them: they are the night mare, they sit upon my bosom, oppress me, suffocate me. I cannot act. I cannot move.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>This, my lord, may be an apology to yourself, but the consequence to me is misery. Your daughter lived in my heart: with her I had promised
<pb n="32" facs="32"/>
myself ages of happiness; and had cherished a passion, impatient perhaps, but, ardent and pure as her own thoughts. This passion your conduct authorized. My fortune, my life, my soul, were devoted to her. Mine was no light or wanton dalliance; nor did I expect a light and wanton conduct from the noble family of which your lordship is the head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean, Mr. Delaval? I told you I was undecided; and so I am still. My lady, you know, was never much your friend. Sir George is her favourite.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>And is Lady Jane equally changeable?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>I don't know. She is <hi>my</hi> daughter; and, judging by myself, I should suppose she is perplexed, and doubtful. She never, I believe, declared in your favour?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Not expressly, my lord. She referred me to time and you. 'Tis true I flattered myself her affections were wholly mine. Should she prefer Sir George, or any other man, be my feelings what they will, I then am silenced. My heart could not be satisfied with cold compliance. Oh no! 'Tis of a different stamp. I am told she is not at home. I hope however she will not have the cruelty to deny me a last interview: till when I take my leave. Only suffer me to remark that, had you discovered in me any secret vice, any defects dangerous to the happiness of the woman I adore, you then were justified in your present conduct. But, if you have no such accusation to prefer, I must do my feelings the violence to declare I cannot but think it highly unworthy of a man of honor. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>

<p>Really, daughter, I cannot understand you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>No wonder, madam; for I do not half understand myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible you can hesitate? The good humour and complaisance of Sir George might captivate any woman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>They are very engaging: but they are dangerous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Which way?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>His character is too pliant. If others are merry, so is he: if they are sad, he is the same. Their joys and sorrows play upon his countenance: but, though they may slightly graze, they do not penetrate his heart. Even while he relieves, he scarcely feels them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! He is a delightful man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>I grant he does his utmost. But it is a folly to be the slave even of an endeavour to please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Upon my honor, you are a whimsical young lady! Afraid of marrying
<pb n="41" facs="41"/>
a man because of his assiduous endeavours to please! As if that were a husband's failing! You can prefer no such accusation against Mr. Delaval.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>I own he is of a very different character. Firm and inflexible, he imagines he makes virtue his rule, and reason his guide.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Firm indeed? No, no: ferocious, obstinate, perverse. Sir George tries to be agreeable, and is successful: Mr. Delaval has no fear of offending, and does not miss his aim.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>Heaven help us! We all have faults and follies enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Delaval never was approved by me; and this morning he has insulted your father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>Insulted! How do you mean, madam? Mr. Delaval is abroad! Has he written?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>No. He is here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>Here! And has he not thought proper to let me know of his arrival?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>No, no. The haughty gentleman has only thought proper to reproach Lord Vibrate for admitting the pretensions of Sir George. He is too proud to endure a competitor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! Such pride is the very way to insure his competitor success. Insulted my father!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>I will leave you to judge how deeply when I tell you that, fluctuating and undecided as Lord Vibrate always is, he was so offended that he pledged his honor in favor of Sir George.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>Insult my father, and not deign to let me know of his arrival!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>I hope, when Sir George comes, you will admit him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, madam; certainly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="42" facs="42"/>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>And that Mr. Delaval will be denied.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>It seems I need give myself no concern about that: the gentleman will not even take the trouble to send up his name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>I am glad you feel it properly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, madam. I will not condescend to feel it, in the least. It shall not affect me; no not for a moment. I had indeed conceived a very different opinion of Mr. Delaval. I am glad I have discovered my error, before it is too late. I could not have believed it possible! But it shall not disturb me. It shall give me no uneasiness.

<p>Ha, ha, ha! Very true.</p>

<p>My dear lady, you mistake. I do it from pure compassion. It makes him happy. Every child delights in the squeaking of its own trumpet; and shall I have the cruelty to break the toy?

<p>I have been too sudden. I ought not to have pledged my honor. This is the consequence of hasty determination: of not doubting before we decide.

<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Why money!—Then the manners of this dissipated age!</p>

<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>They are truly shocking! They, they, they are absurd, ridiculous, odious, abominable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>And to what do they lead?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>To every thing that is horrid! To loss of peace, loss of property, loss of principle, loss of respect, bankruptcy, ruin, contempt, disease, and death!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside)</stage> Yes, yes: he's the man! I do not think I repent—Heaven be praised, Sir George, you are a man of understanding; an economist. You will regulate your family and affairs to my heart's content.</p>

<p>Oh! it shall be my study! my daily practice! my duty! my delight!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Dear, my lord, why so? Women are the most manageable good creatures upon earth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Women good?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Indubitably: when they are pleased.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>So they say is the devil.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>The sweet angels deserve to be humoured. Their smiles are so enchanting! And, should they frown, who can be angry when we know the dear wayward syrens will only look the more bewitching, as soon as they are out of their pouts? It is so delightful to see the Sun breaking from behind a cloud.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! When a woman begins to grow old—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Hush! The Sun—The Sun never
<pb n="50" facs="50"/>
grows old. I grant you that formerly there used to be old women: but there are none now!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Then you think me a fool for being wretched at my wife's thoughtlessness, caprice, and impertinence?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>No, I don't. Every body tells us that wives were born to be the plague of their husbands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>And mine is the greatest of plagues!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>What is a wife's duty? To obey her lord and master. 'Tis her marriage promise, and the law binds her to it. She is the minister of his pleasures, the handmaid of his wants, his goods, his chattels, his vendible property.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Ay: we find the husband may take the wife to market in a halter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>In which I should hope he would afterward hang himself!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>My lady thinks of nothing but revelling, and racketing, and turning the world upside down!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a great pity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Her tongue is my torment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>The perpetual motion! It never ceases!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Then how can you like her company?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>She is not <hi>my</hi> wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>No, or you would not be such good friends. Did she say any thing concerning the marriage?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes. She delivered your lordship's kind message.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>What, that I had pledged my honor?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Irrevocably.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="51" facs="51"/>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>I was very rash. Hasty resolutions bring long repentance—She insists that the nuptials shall be public!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Does she, indeed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>For my part, I hate any display of vanity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>It is extremely ridiculous! What would our ostentation, pomp, and magnificence be, but advertising ourselves to the world as fools and coxcombs?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Is that a rational use of money?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Should it not be applied to relieve the aged, comfort the poor, succour the distressed—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Reward merit, encourage industry, and promote the public good?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Promote a farce!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Very true: the public good is a farce!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>The true use of money is to defend our rights—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Revenge our wrongs, purchase for the present, provide for the future, secure power, buy friends, bid defiance to enemies, and lead the world in a string!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Ay! Now you talk sense. So, if I should consent, the wedding shall be private.</p>

<p>So large, my lord, that I have no means of paying it. I must languish out my life in a prison.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>No, Mr. Thompson, no: you shall not do that. I will—And yet—Two hundred—A prison—I don't know what to say. If I pay this money for you, I shall but encourage all around me to run in debt.</p>

<p>It is a favour too great for me to hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>You are a worthy man, and a prison is a bad place—I—you—Pray what is your opinion, Sir George? Is it not dangerous for a man to have the character of being charitable?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>No doubt, my lord! It is the very certain way for his house to be besieged by beggars!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>The master who pays the debts of one domestic makes himself the debtor of all the rest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>He changes a set of servants into a set
<pb n="66" facs="66"/>
of duns! He first encourages them to be extravagant, and then makes it incumbent upon himself to pay for their follies and vices! He not only bribes them to be idle, and insolent, but to waste his property as well as their own!</p>

<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>It is, as you say, a very serious case. I—I am sorry for your misfortune, Mr. Thompson—very sorry—but—really—</p>

<p>Misfortune! What misfortune?</p>

<p>Very true: very true.—He has lived with your lordship several years?</p>

<p>He has; and I esteem him highly.</p>

<p>A worthy man, whom it would be no disgrace to call your friend?</p>

<p>Nothing, my lord. I am resigned. When I assisted my brother, I did no more than my duty. Those who lock me up in a prison may, for aught I know, do theirs: yet, though they are at liberty and I shall be confined, I would neither change duties nor hearts with them. <stage>(Going.)</stage></p>

<p>Sir George! My lord!</p>

<p>Oh! Is that it?—If we give, I say, with—too—Pshaw! I have lost the thread of my argument.</p>

<p>I must own, this is a dubious case. Perhaps I ought to pay the money. <stage>(Calls)</stage> Mr. Thompson!—I don't think I ought to let him go to prison. What shall I do, Sir George?</p>

<p>I beg your pardon! <hi>Sir,</hi> since you prefer it.</p>

<p>If you know me, sir, your insolence is but a confirmation of the baseness of your character!</p>

<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside)</stage> Zounds! She insists upon a tête-à-téte!—I hope you will be kind enough to excuse me, but I am just now so pressed for time that I have not a moment to spare. Company is waiting. I must begone to the masquerade. You I presume are for the same place, and are ready dressed. I am your most obedient—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Seizing him)</stage> Sir, I insist upon your naming an hour, to-morrow; and an early one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Why, what the plague!—Here must be some mistake! Permit me to ask, do you know Dr. Gosterman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Was you not just now in danger of sainting?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Faint? I faint!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>It would I think be a very extraordinary thing! But so he told me: with other particulars.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Absurd! Dr. Gosterman has not seen me for several months.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>He said, sir, you were a woman; and
<pb n="71" facs="71"/>
perhaps, from that error, I may have unconsciously provoked you to behaviour which would else have been rather strange. Have I given you any other offence?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir; a mortal one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Mortal!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>And mortal must be the atonement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>If so, the sooner the better. Let it be immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>No. I have serious concerns to settle. So have you! 'Tis time you should think of things very different from masquerading. Name your hour to-morrow morning; then, take an enemy's advice, retire to your closet, and make your will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>To whom am I indebted for this high menace, and this haughty warning? Your name, sir?</p>

<p>I own, I had something on my spirits. But it is gone. Your ladyship's vivacity is an antidote to splenetic fits.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Whom do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>You must have been a man of uncommon worth; for I have heard him bestow such praises upon you that my heart has palpitated if your name was but mentioned!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Of whom are you talking?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>Lord! that you should be so forgetful! That can only have happened since you became a person of fashion: for no man once remembered his friends better. It is true, they were then useful to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I—Be warned! Pursue this no farther.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>You little suspected at that time you were on the eve of being a wealthy baronet. Oh
<pb n="75" facs="75"/>
no! And to see how kind and grateful you were to those who loved you! No one would have believed you could so soon have become a perfect man of the mode; and with so polite and easy an indifference so entirely have forgotten all your old acquaintance! I dare say you scarcely remember the late Colonel Delaval.</p>

<p>I insist on knowing who you are!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>How different it was when, your merit neglected, your spirits depressed, and your poverty despised, you groaned under the oppression of an unjust and selfish world! How did your drooping spirits revive by the fostering smiles of the man who first noticed you, took you to his house and heart, and adopted you as his son! Poor Maria! Silly girl, to love as she did! Where is she?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>This is not to be endured!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>What was her offence? You became a baronet! Ay! True, that was her crime. Yet, when your fortunes were low, it was not imputed to you as guilt.</p>

She should have been your bride: then let her be your bride maid—She is greatly altered—She will be less beautiful—now—than her fair rival. Her birth is not quite so high—but—if a—heart—a heart—

<p>Well, well, Lady Jane, that is not to be argued now. I am a man, and subject to the mistakes of man. There are feelings which can and feelings which cannot be subdued. I must run my course, and take all consequences.</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Williams! Every thing is right: is not it? All is as it should be?</p>

<p>That is more than I know.</p>

<p>Nay but, what news do you bring? Speak.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WILL.</speaker>
<p>Why you know my master last night made enquiries how to find the chambers of Counsellor Demur: so, when he went out this morning, I observed your directions and followed him. He went to the Counsellor's, in Lincoln's Inn; and there I left him and hurried away to Sir George's, to enquire and hear all I could: though it was rather unlucky that I was not acquainted in the family.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>Did not you make use of my name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WILL.</speaker>
<p>Oh yes, my lady. Beside, servants your ladyship knows are not so suspicious as their masters: they soon become friendly together: so in five minutes Sir George's valet and I were on as intimate a footing as we could wish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>And what did he say? Tell me.</p>

<p>Why, ma'am, he said that Sir George did not leave his own house last night, after the fainting of the young gentleman.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>LU.</speaker>
<p>That was you, you know, ma'am.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>WILL.</speaker>
<p>And, what is more, that he did not go to bed; but walked up and down the room till
<pb n="80" facs="80"/>
daylight in the morning; and then called I don't know how often to warn the servants that he should not be at home to any body whatever, except to a strange gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>My brother!</p>
</sp>

<p>And at what hour was Mr. Delaval to be there?</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>The worst I foreboded will happen!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>What can be done?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>WILL.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps it will be best for me to go back to Sir George's, wait for the arrival of my master, and, if he should come, hasten away as fast as I can to inform you of it.</p>

<sp>

<p>That is a good thought, Mr. Williams! Is not it, madam? A very good thought, indeed! Don't you think it is, my lady?</p>

<p>Good morning, sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>You recollect me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Perfectly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>'Tis well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>I have been anxious for your coming. Your menace lives in my memory; and I shall be glad to know the name of him who has threatened such mortal enmity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>A little patience will be necessary. I must preface my proceedings with a short story.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>I shall be all attention. Please to be seated. Wave ceremony, and to the subject— <stage>(They sit)</stage> Now, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>About six years ago, a certain youth came up from college; poor, and unprotected. He was a scholar, pleasing in manner, warm and generous of temper, of a respectable family, and seemed to possess the germ of every virtue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Well, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Hear me on: my praises will not be tedious. Chance made him known to a man who desired to cherish his good qualities; and the purse, the experience, and the power of his benefactor, such as they were, he profited by to the utmost. Received as a son, he soon became dear to the family: but most dear to the daughter of his friend; whose tender age and glowing affections made her apt to admire the virtues she heard her father so ardently praise, and encourage. You are uneasy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Be pleased to continue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>The assiduities of the youth to gain her
<pb n="83" facs="83"/>
heart were unabating; and his pretensions, poor and unknown as he then was, were not rejected. The noble nature of his friend scorned to make his poverty his crime. Why do you bite your lip? Was it not generous?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Firmly)</stage> Was it not?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Certainly! Nothing could—equal the—generosity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>The health of his benefactor was declining fast; and the only thing required of the youth was that he should qualify himself for the cares of life, by some profession. He therefore entered a student in the Temple; and the means were furnished by his protector, till the end was obtained. Was not this friendship?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>It was.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>The lady, almost a child when first he knew her, increased in grace and beauty faster than in years. Sweetness and smiles played upon her countenance. She was the delight of her friends, the admiration of the world, and the coveted of every eye. Lovers of fortune and fashion contended for her hand: but she had bestowed her heart—had bestowed it on a—Sit still, sir; I shall soon have done. I am coming to the point. Five years elapsed; during which the youth received every kindness friendship could afford, and every proof chaste affection had to give. These he returned with promises and protestations that seemed too vast for his heart. I would say for his tongue—Are you unwell, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Go on with your tale.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>His benefactor, feeling the hand of death steal on, was anxious to see the two persons dearest
<pb n="84" facs="84"/>
to his heart happy before he expired; and the marriage was determined on, the day fixed, and the friends of the family invited. The intended bridegroom appeared half frantic with his approaching bliss. Now, sir, mark his proceeding. In this short interval, by sudden and unexpected deaths, he becomes the heir to a title and large estate. Well! Does he not fly to the arms of his languishing friend? Does he not pour his new treasures and his transports into the lap of love? Coward and monster!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Both starting up)</stage> Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Viler than words can paint! Having robbed a family of honor, a friend of peace, and an angel of every human solace, he fled, like a thief, and concealed himself from immediate contempt and vengeance in a foreign country. But contempt and vengeance have at length overtaken him: they beset him: they face him at this instant. The friend he wronged is dead: but the son of that friend lives, and I am he.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>'Tis as I thought!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>You are—I will not defile my lips by telling you what you are.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>I own that what I have done—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Forbear to interrupt me, sir. You have nothing to plead, and much to hear. First say, did my sister, by any improper conduct, levity of behaviour, or fault or vice whatever, give you just cause to abandon her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>None! None! Her purity is only exceeded by her love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Then how, barbarian, how had you the heart to disgrace the family and endanger the life of a woman whose sanctified affection would have
<pb n="85" facs="85"/>
embraced you in poverty, pestilence, or death; and who, had she possessed empires, would have bestowed them with an imperial affection?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Sir, if you ask, Have I committed errors? call them crimes if you will, Yes. If you demand, Will I justify them? No. If you require me to atone for them, here is my heart: you have wrongs to revenge, strike; and, if you can, inflict a pang greater than any it yet has known.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Justice is not to be disarmed by being braved. To the question. It can be no part of your intention, and certainly not of mine, that you should marry my sister. Something very different must be done.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>What? Name it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>You must give me an acknowledgment, written and signed by yourself, that you have basely and most dishonorably injured, insulted and betrayed Maria Delaval: and this paper, immediately as I leave your house, I shall publish in every possible way; till my sister shall be so appeased, and honor so satiated, that vengeance itself shall cry, Hold!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Written by me! Published! No. I will sign no such paper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>So I supposed; and the alternative follows. Here I am: nor will I quit you, go where you will, till you shall consent to retire with me to some place from which one of us must never return. Should I be the victor, flight, banishment from my native country, and the bitterest recollections of the villanies of man, must be the fate of me and my sister. If I fall, you then may triumph and she languish and die unrevenged. This,
<pb n="86" facs="86"/>
or the written acknowledgment. Consider, and chuse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>What can I answer? The paper you shall not have. My life you are welcome to: take it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Have you not brought disgrace enough on my family? Would you make me an assassin? My sister and my father loved you. Let me, if possible, feel some little return of respect for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Having wronged the sister, would you have me murder the brother? Already the most guilty of men, would you make me the worst of fiends? Though an enemy, be a generous one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Plausible sophist! The paper, sir: or, man to man and arm to arm, close the scene of my dishonor, or your own. The written acknowledgment. Determine. <stage>(Walks away and views the pictures)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Apart)</stage> Why, ay! 'Tis come home! I have sought it, deserved it, 'tis fallen, and the rock must crush the reptile!—Then welcome ruin. The sword must decide. <stage>(Goes to take his sword, but stops)</stage> The sword? What! Betray the sister and assassinate the brother? Oh God! And such a brother! Stern, but noble minded: indignant of injury, peerless in affection, and proud of a sister whom the world might worship; but whom I, worthless wretch, in levity and pride of heart, have abandoned. <stage>(Aloud)</stage> Mr. Delaval!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>My behaviour to your sister is—what I cannot endure to name—'Tis hateful! 'Tis—infamous!
<pb n="87" facs="87"/>
My obligations to your most excellent father, the respect you have inspired me with, and my love for Maria—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Insolent! Insufferable meanness! The paper, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Angry though you are, Mr. Delaval, you must hear me. I say, my love, my adoration of Maria has but increased my guilt. It has made me dread her contempt. I durst not face the angel whom I had so deeply injured.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Artifice! Evasion! Cowardice!—Your signature!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Snatching up his sword from the table)</stage> You shall have it. Follow me.</p>

<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Fear me not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Stopping short)</stage> Hold, Mr. Delaval. Justice is on your side. If your firmness be not a savage spirit of revenge, if you do not thirst for blood, you will feel my only resource will be to fall on your sword. I cannot lift my arm against you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Then sign the acknowledgment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Can you in the spirit even of an enemy ask it? Do you not already despise me enough? Think for a moment: am I the only man that ever erred? Is it so wonderful that a giddy youth, whose habitual failing was compliance, by sudden accident elevated to the pinnacle of fortune, surrounded by proud and selfish relations of whose approbation I was vain, is it so strange that I should be overpowered by their dictates, and yield to their intreaties? Your friendship or my death is now the only alternative. Suppose the latter: will it honor you among men? At the man of blood the heart of man revolts! Will it endear you to
<pb n="88" facs="88"/>
Maria? Kind forgiving angel, and hateful to myself as her affection makes me, I last night found that affection still as strong, still as pure, as in the first hour of our infant loves. Lady Jane—</p>

<p>Forbear to name her! 'Tis profanation from your lips! No more casuistry! No subterfuge! The paper!</p>

<head>SCENE THE LAST. <stage><hi>Enter Mr.</hi> DELAVAL <hi>leading</hi> LADY JANE, <hi>and</hi> SIR GEORGE <hi>with</hi> MARIA, <hi>followed by</hi> LUCY.</stage></head>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Delaval, I have great obligations to you. Thompson has been telling me of your disinterested equity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>The obligation, my lord, was mine. Your lordship well knows that the first of obligations is to be just.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Well, well; but the estate you are so willing to resign will still, I hope, be yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Nay, my lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Dubious as all things are, that is a subject on which I protest I do not believe I shall ever have any doubts. What say you, Lady Jane? <stage>(Irony)</stage> But now I have my doubts again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Eagerly)</stage> What doubts, my lord?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>I doubt whether you understand me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
<p>Would your lordship teach me to dissemble?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD V.</speaker>
<p>Um—I doubt whether that would be much for your good.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>I hope Lady Vibrate will not oppose our union?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
<p>No, Mr. Delaval. Your last generous action has charmed me; and Sir George—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR G.</speaker>
<p>Has declined in your good opinion. But you cannot think so ill of me as I do of myself; and, if ever again I should recover my own self respect, I shall be indebted for it to this best of men, and to this most incomparable and affectionate of women!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>My present joys are inexpressible!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEL.</speaker>
<p>Which my impetuous indignation threatened▪ for ever to destroy. <stage>(Comes forward)</stage> How dangerous are extremes! Sometimes we doubt, and indecision is our bane: at others, hurried away by the sudden impulse of passion, our course is marked with misery. One man is too compliant: another too intractable. Yet happiness is the aim of all. Since then all are so liable to be misled, let gentle forbearance, indulgent thoughts, and a mild forgiving spirit, be ever held as the sacred duties of man to man.</p>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>SPOKEN BY MR. QUICK, AND MRS. MATTOCKS.</byline>
<stage>(As Mr Pope concludes and is preparing to low to the audience, Mr Quick with some importance comes forward.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Q.</speaker>
<l>HOLD, Mr. Pope! Please to give place to me:</l>
<l>'Tis my part to conclude the comedy.</l>
<l>Hem! Hem! <stage>(Begins a grave and stately how.)</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<l><stage>(Eagerly advancing.)</stage> Yours, Mr. Quick? I beg you'll hold your tongue!</l>
<l>All Epilogues of right to me belong.</l>
<l>You tease the audience, sir; and put me out.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Q.</speaker>
<l>Tease? Humph! Permit me, madam, there to doubt.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<l>Your part is over, now; your <hi>doubts</hi> are ended.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Q.</speaker>
<l>Would that they were! <stage>(To the audience.)</stage> Say, friends, are you offended?</l>
<l>Or are you pleas'd? Which way do you incline?</l>
<l>The author has his doubts; and I have mine;</l>
<l>Pronounce our doom: relieve us from our pain!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<l><stage>(Laughs.)</stage> Look at those dismal features and refrain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Q.</speaker>
<l>Should it be fatal, hear, oh hear, our pleadings!</l>
<l>Grant an arrest of judgment: stay proceedings:</l>
<l>I move the court—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<l>You move? Stand back! I'll wait no longer.</l>
<l>I tell you once again I am th' Epilogue monger.</l>
</sp>
<stage>(Surveys him and laughs)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Q.</speaker>
<l>What do you laugh at?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<l>You! There's reason ample▪</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Q.</speaker>
<l><stage>(Retiring.)</stage> I beg, sirs, you'll not follow her example.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="96" facs="96"/>
<speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
<l>The hypocrite! Well, well, I'm glad he's gone:</l>
<l>For now the <hi>pleadings</hi> will be all my own.</l>
<l>The author hopes I'll advocate his play.</l>
<l>Heaven help the man! What would he have me say?</l>
<stage>(Recollecting.)</stage>
<l>Something about the anxious months he spent,</l>
<stage>(Pompously.)</stage>
<l>His garret traversing his brain intent</l>
<l>On this, and that, and t'other; action, plot,</l>
<l>Wit, humour, passion; and the lord knows what!</l>
<l>And tell how difficult it was to write</l>
<l>The charming nonsense you have heard to-night!—</l>
<l>Poor fool! When he suppos'd his work complete,</l>
<l>He thought he had achiev'd a mighty feat!</l>
<l>Nay he protests that earth and heaven he'd move,</l>
<l>Could he but pen what you might well approve.</l>
<l>The man speaks fair; is tolerably civil:</l>
<l>Then, since an author's only a poor devil,</l>
<l>Doom him to what will give us all delight:</l>
<l>Make him repeat his follies every night.</l>
