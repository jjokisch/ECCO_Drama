<p>THE ROAD TO RUIN: A COMEDY.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. FAWCET.</byline>
<stage>Enter, driving a boy across the stage.</stage>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>AWAY! 'Sblood! Run for the Author! We can do nothing till he appears.</l>
<l>Tell him in less than five minutes we shall have the house about our ears!</l>
</lg>
<stage>[To the audience.]</stage>
<lg>
<l>Oh sirs! The prompter has mislaid the prologue, and we are all a mort,</l>
<l>I suppose our friends above yonder will soon be making pretty sport;</l>
<l>For pity's sake, suffer us to go on without it—Good, dear sirs, do!</l>
<l>'Twas most abominably dull—Zounds! There stands the writer. Well, It's very true.</l>
<l>One of our te tum ti heroes was to have spoken it, who measure nonsense out by the yard;</l>
<l>And our chief hope was you'd make too much noise for it to be heard.</l>
<l>The author had mounted on the stilts of oratory and elocution:</l>
<l>Not but he had a smart touch or two, about Poland, France, and the—the revolution;</l>
<l>Telling us that Frenchman, and Polishman, and every man is our brother;</l>
<l>And that all men, ay, even poor negro men, have a right to be free one as well as another!</l>
<l>Freedom at length, said he, like a torrent is spreading and swelling,</l>
<l>To sweep away pride and reach the most miserable dwelling:</l>
<l>To ease happiness, art, science, wit, and genius to give birth;</l>
<l>Ay, to fertilize a world, and renovate old earth!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus he went on, not mentioning a word about the play:</l>
<l>For he says prologues are blots, which ought to be wiped away:</l>
<l>A gothic practice, and in spite of precedent, not the better for being old,</l>
<l>For, if we tell any part of the plot, it then becomes a tale twice told,</l>
<l>And such twice telling can rarely once excite our wonder:</l>
<l>Ergo, he that says nothing is least likely to blunder.</l>
<l>Since therefore prologues are bad things at best, pray, my good friends,</l>
<l>Never mind the want of one, but live in hopes the play will make amends.</l>

<p>PAST two o'clock and not yet returned!—Well, well!—It's my own fault!—Mr. Smith!</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mr. SMITH.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Smith.</speaker>
<p>Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dornton.</speaker>
<p>Is Mr. Sulky come in?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Are you sure Harry Dornton said he should return to-night?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>And you don't know where he is gone?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr Sm.</speaker>
<p>He did not tell me, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Angrily]</stage> I ask you if you know!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>I believe to Newmarket, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>You always believe the worst!—I'll sit up no longer—Tell the servants to go to bed—And do you hear, should he apply to you for money, don't let him have a guinea.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>Very well, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>I have done with him; he is henceforth no son of mine! Let him starve!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>He acts very improperly, sir, indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Improperly! How? What does he do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>Sir! <stage>[Alarmed.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Have you heard any thing of—?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Confused]</stage> No—No, sir—Nothing—Nothing but what you yourself tell me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Then how do you known he has acted improperly</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>He is certainly a very good-hearted young gentleman, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Good-hearted! How dare you make such an assertion?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>How dare you, Mr. Smith, insult me so? Is not his gaming notorious; his racing, driving, riding, and associating with knaves, fools, debauchees, and black legs?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word, sir—I—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>But it's over! His name has this very day been struck out of the firm! Let his drafts be returned. It's all ended! <stage>[Passionately]</stage> And observe, not a guinea! If you lend him any yourself I'll not pay you. I'll no longer be a fond doting father! Therefore take warning! Take warning, I say! be his distress what it will, not a guinea! Though you should hereafter see him begging, starving in the streets, not so much as the loan or the gift of a single guinea! <stage>[With great passion.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>I shall be careful to observe your orders, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Sir! <stage>[Terror]</stage> Why, would you see him starve?—Would you see him starve and not lend him a guinea? Would you sir? Would you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>Sir!—Certainly not, except in obedience to your orders!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Amazement and compassion]</stage> And could any orders justify your seeing a poor unfortunate youth, rejected by his father, abandoned by his friends, starving to death?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>There is no danger of that, sir,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>I tell you the thing shall happen! He shall starve to death! <stage>[Horror at the supposition]</stage> I'll never look on him more as a son of mine; and I am very certain, when I have forsaken him, all the world will forsake him too. <stage>[Almost in tears.]</stage> Yes, yes! He is born to be a poor wretched outcast!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>I hope, sir, he still will make a fine man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Will!—There is not a finer, handsomer, nobler looking youth in the kingdom; no not in the world!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>I mean a worthy good man, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>How can you mean any such thing! The company he keeps would corrupt a saint.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Sm.</speaker>
<p>Sir, if you will only tell me what your pleasure is, I will endeavour to act like a faithful servant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>I know you are a faithful servant, Mr. Smith.— <stage>[Takes his hand]</stage> I know you are—But you—You are not a father.</p>

<p>I love to torture you.</p>

<p>Worse.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Mercy defend me!—Where? What?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>The first paragraph in the postscript: the beginning line in capitals.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage> The junior partner of the great banking house, not a mile from the Post-office, has again been touched at Newmarket, for upward of ten thousand pounds— <stage>[Pause]</stage> It can't be!</p>

<p>Humph.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>His own hand-writing.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Bills at three days sight to the full amount have already been presented.</p>

<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>I soon shall be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>

<p>I can—Ruin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Are you serious, sir?</p>

<p>Yes, I know I offend. I was bred in your house, you used me tenderly, I served you faithfully, and you admitted me a partner. Don't think I care for myself. No, I can sit at the desk again.

<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>What, not to see the grand match?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>No,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>Oh yes, you will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>No, I am determined:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>Yes, over night, you'll waver in the morning;</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>No, It is high time, Jack, to grow prudent:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, my plan is formed: I'll soon be out of debt,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>How will you get the money?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil,</speaker>
<p>By calculation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>I am resolved on it. What! can't a man of invention and genius out-wit a black-leg?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>"Yes, if he will be as great a scoundrel."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>That's not necessary. A keen eye a contriving head, a lucky moment and a little algebra will rout the whole host. How many men of rank and honour, having lost their fortunes, have double recovered them</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>And very honourably;</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>who doubts it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha—Nobody, Nobody;</p>

<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>But pray Harry, what is it you find so attractive in my late father's amorous relict?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! What the widow Warren?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil,</speaker>
<p>She seems to think and even reports you are to marry—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>Marry? Her? A coquette of forty, who ridiculously apes all the airs of a girl! Fantastic, selfish and a fool! And marry? Disgusting idea! Thou wert philosophising as we drove on the condition of a post-horse—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>Well?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>I would rather be a post-horse, nay the rascal that drives a post-horse, than the base thing thou hast imagined!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>Then why are you so often there?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>Because I can't keep away:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>What, it is her daughter, Sophia?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>Lovely bewitching innocent!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>The poor young thing is fond of you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>I should be half mad if I though she was not, yet am obliged to half hope she is not!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>Why?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>What a question! Am I not a profligate, and in all probability ruined?—Not even my father can overlook this last affair—No,—Heigho;</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>The loss of my father's will, and the mystery made of its contents by those who witnessed it, are strange circumstances!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>In which the widow triumphs. And you being a bastard, and left by law to starve, she willingly pays obedience to laws so wise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>She refuses even to pay my debts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>And the worthy alderman, your father, being overtaken by death in the south of France, carefully makes a will, and then as carefully hides it where it is not to be found; or commits it to the custody of some mercenary knave, who has made his market of it to the widow—So! here comes the supposed executor of this supposed will.</p>
<stage>Enter Mr. SULKY.</stage>
<p>My dear Mr. Sulky, how do you do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sulky</speaker>
<p>Very ill.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>Indeed? I am very sorry! What's your disorder?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>You,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>Ruin, bankruptcy, infamy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>The old story!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>To a new tune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>You are—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>What, my good cynic?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>A fashionable gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>I know it,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>And fashionably ruined.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>No—I have a father,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>Who is ruined likewise:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Is the Bank of England ruined?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>I say ruined. Nothing less than a miracle can save the house. The purse of Fortunatus could not supply you,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>No; it held nothing but guineas, notes, bills paper for me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>Such effrontery is insufferable. For these five years, sir, you have been driving to ruin more furiously than—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>An ambassadour's coach on a birth night. I saw you were stammering for a simile.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>Youth mounts the box, seizes the reins, and jehus headlong on in the dark; Passion and Prodigality blaze in the front, bewilder the coachman, and dazzle and blind the passengers; Wisdom, Prudence, and Virtue are overset and maimed or murdered; and at last Repentance, like the footman's flambeau lagging behind, lights us to dangers when they are past all remedy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>Your name is struck off the firm. I was the adviser</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>You are very kind, Mr Sulky,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>Your father is at last determined.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha—Do you think so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>You'll find so! And what brought you here, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>A chaise and four. <stage>[To Milford.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>It might have carried you to a safer place. When do you mean to pay your debts?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil</speaker>
<p>When my father's executor prevails on the widow Warren to do me justice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>And which way am I to prevail?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>And which way am I to pay my debts?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>You might have more modesty than insolently to come and brave one of your principal creditors, after having ruined his son by your evil counsel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha,—Don't believe a word on't, my good grumbler; I ruined myself, I wanted no counsellor,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>My father died immensely rich; and, though I am what the law calls illegitimate, I ought not to starve</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>You have had five thousand pounds, and are five more in debt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>Yes, thanks to those who trust boys with thousands,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul</speaker>
<p>You would do the same now you think yourself a man,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Firmly]</stage> Indeed I would not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Had you been watching the widow at home, instead of galloping after a knot of gamblers and pickpockets, you might perhaps have done yourself more service:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>Which way, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>The will of your late father is found.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>Found?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>I have received a letter, from which I learn it was at last discovered, carefully locked up in a private drawer, and that it is now a full month since a gentleman of Montpelier, coming to England, was entrusted with it. But no such gentleman has yet appeared.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>If it should have got into the hands of the widow—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Which I suspect it has,—You are a couple of pretty gentlemen! But beware: misfortune is at your heels, Mr. Dornton vows vengeance on you both, and justly. He is not gone to bed: and if you have confidence enough to look him in the face, I would have you stay where you are,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>I neither wish to insult nor be insulted. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Do you know, sir, your father turned the poor fellow into the street, who compassionately opened the door for you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and my father knows I as compassionately opened the door for the poor fellow in return.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Very well, sir—Your fame is increasing daily:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har,</speaker>
<p>I am glad to hear it:</p>

<p>Paragraphed? What? Where?</p>

<p>Yours—You march through every avenue to fame, dirty, or clean,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Well said!—Be witty when you can; sarcastic you must be, in spite of your teeth. But I like you the better. You are honest, you are my cruet of Cayenne, and a sprinkling of you is excellent:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, when you know the state of your own affairs, and to what you have reduced the house, you will perhaps be less ready to grin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Reduced the house! ha, ha, ha!</p>

<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>A redundancy, a negation; a besotted sophisticated incumbrance; a jumble of fatuity; your head, your heart, your words, your actions. all a jargon; incoherent and unintellegible to yourself, absurd and offensive to others!</p>

<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>I am whatever you please, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Bills never examined, every thing bought on credit, the price of nothing asked, conscious you were weak enough to wish for baubles you did not want, and pant for pleasures you could not enjoy, you had not the effrontery to assume the circumspect caution of common sense! And to your other destructive follies, you must add the detestable vice of gaming!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>These things, sir, are much easier done than defended,</p>

<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>The partners are very kind.</p>

<p>Oh but I am—I wonder why she won't let me wear high-heeled shoes! I am sure I am old enough! I shall be eighteen next Christmas day at midnight, which is only nine months and two days!

<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>You won't give me leave to say any thing madam</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>You know you are a shocking troublesome man, Mr Sulky, I have a thousand things to remember, and can't bear teasing, it fatigues my spirits! so pray relate this very urgent business of yours in a single word—What would you have—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Justice,</p>

<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Yes of sollies innumerable!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>You are a sad savage, Mr. Sulky! And who is it you want justice for?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Your late husband's son, John Milford,</p>
</sp>

<p>Now pray don't talk to me! You are a very intrusive person! You quite derange my ideas! I can think of nothing soft or satisfactory while you are present!</p>

<p>Will you hear me, madam?</p>

<p>Nah, ma', how can you be so cross to my brother Milford—</p>

<p>Your brother, child—Country education!—how often, minikin, have I told you he is no brother of yours,</p>

<p>La, ma', he was your husband's son!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Humph!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>And would you now, you who pretend to be a very prudent—ridiculous kind of a person, wish to see me squander the wealth of my poor dear dead good man on Mr Milford, and his profligate companions?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Not I indeed, madam; though the profligate to whom you make love should happen to be one of them</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Oh the monster,—I make love!—You have no eyes, Mr Sulky! <stage>[Walking and exhibiting herself]</stage> You are really blind!—But I know whom you mean.</p>

<p>To be sure you do,—whom could you mean? Elegant youth!—Rapturous thoughts!</p>

<p>And it's very scandalous, very scandalous indeed, to say he is my ma's lover!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Ha, ha, ha! You are a shocking being, Mr Sulky,—But if you should happen to see Mr Dornton, do astonish your acquaintance: do a good natured thing, and tell him I am at home all day—Love to you?

<p>That you are all intelligence, all grace, all wit,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph</speaker>
<p>To be sure my ma' caught me singing it, and she was pettish; because you know it's all about love and ends with a happy marriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="23" facs="22"/>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>But why pettish?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>La, I can't tell, I suppose she wants to have all the marriage in the world to herself! It's her whole talk! I do believe she'd be married every morning that she rises, if any body would have her!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Think not of her, my sweet Sophia, but tell me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>I dare not ask,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Why?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Lest I should offend you,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Nay now, Mr Dornton, that is not right of you! I am never offended with any body, and I am sure I should not be offended with you! my grandma' always said I was the best tempered girl in the world—What is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Were you—? <stage>[Taking her hand]</stage> Did you ever know what it is to love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>La, now, how could you ask one such question? You know very well one must not tell!—Besides, you know too one must not be in love—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Why not?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Because—Because I am but a girl—my grandma' has told me a hundred times, it's a sin for any body to be in love before they be a woman grown, full one-and twenty; and I am not eighteen!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Love they say cannot be resisted,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Ah, but I have been taught better!—It may be resisted—Nobody need be in love unless they like: and so I won't be in love, for I won't wilfully do amiss. <stage>[With great positiveness]</stage> No! I won't love any person though I should love him ever so dearly,</p>
</sp>

<p><stage>[Aside]</stage> Angelic innocence! <stage>[Aloud]</stage> Right, lovely Sophia, guard your heart against seducers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Do you know it is full five weeks since Valentine's day; and, because I'm not one-and-twenty, nobody sent me a valentine!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>And did you expect one?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Nah—, I can't say but I did think—! in Gloucestershire, if any young man happen to have a liking for a young woman, she is sure to hear of it on Valentine day. But perhaps Valentine day does not fall so soon here as it does in the country;</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Why, it is possible you may yet receive a valentine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="24" facs="23"/>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Nay now, but don't you go to think that I am asking for one; for that would be very wrong of me, and I know better—my grandma' told me I must never mention nor think of such things till I am a woman, full one-and-twenty grown; and that if I were to find such a thing at my window, or under my pillow or concealed in a plumcake—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>A plum-cake?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Yes: I assure you I have heard of a valentine sent baked in a plum-cake—And so if I had one that I must shew it to her. But you know she is in Gloucestershire; And I am sure I would not shew it to ma' for though she is all out and above forty, she would be as jealous as the vengeance! And indeed I would not receive such a thing for the world, no not from the finest man on earth, if I did not think him to be a true and faithful, true, true lover,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>But how must he prove his faith and truth?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Why first he must love me very dearly!—with all his heart and soul!—And then he must be willing to wait till I am one-and-twenty,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>And would not you love in return?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>N—yes, when I come to be one-and-twenty,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Not sooner?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Oh no!—I must not!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Surely you might if you pleased?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Oh but you must not persuade me to that! If you do I shall think you are a bad man, such as my grandma' warned me of!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>and do you think me so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Do I?—No!—I would not think you so for a thousand thousand golden guineas!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Well?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Now what will you give me, and I'll secure her to you,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>You,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>I,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Which way?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>I have a deed in my power, I won't tell you what, but I have it, by which I can make her marry the man I please, or remain a widow all her life; and that I am sure she will never do if she can help it,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>You a deed,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Yes I,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Shew it me,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Not for twenty thousand pounds—depend upon me, I have it, I tell you I'm your friend, and you shall have her, that is on proper conditions—If not, Mr Goldfinch, you shall not have her,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, old Judas, well what are your conditions?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>I find the late alderman died worth a hundred and fifty thousand pounds,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Ay—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Every farthing, Mr Goldfinch! And my conscience tells me that, risk and character and all considered, I must come in for my thirds,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Your conscience tells you that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Yes, it does, Mr Goldfinch—Fifty thousand is a fair price,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>For the soul of a miser,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>If you'll join me, say so,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Fifty thousand,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Not a farthing less! What, will there not be a hundred thousand remaining?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Why that's true—it will cut a fine dash.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="34" facs="33"/>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>To be sure it will! Come with me! I'll draw up a sketch of an agreement. After which we must fight cunning—The widow is a vain weak woman—you must get her written promise,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Written—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Under her own hand; with a good round penalty in case of forfeiture,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Well said, old one!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Not less than twenty thousand pounds! A jury would grant half!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Why you're a good one!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>That would secure something, and we would snack,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Dammee you're a deep one,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Ah, ha, ha! Do you think I am, Mr Goldfinch—signed on a stamp!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold,</speaker>
<p>You know a thing or two:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Ah, ha, ha, ha; do you think I do, Mr Goldfinch,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>You can teach 'em to bite the bubble,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Ah, ha, ha, ha! you joke, Mr Goldfinch, you joke.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>But the devil will have you at last!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Lord forbid, Mr Goldfinch, don't terrify me—I hate the devil, Mr Goldfinch; indeed I do; I hate the name of him! Heaven keep me out of his fiery clutches.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>No: he has you safe enough, bait his trap but with a guinea, and he is sure to find you nibbling—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Don't talk about the devil, Mr Goldfinch, pray don't; but think about the widow secure her,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>I must have the coal though this evening:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Don't lose a moment, Mr Goldfinch;</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Must not lose the eclipse colts—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw, Mr Goldfinch, think less of the colts and more of the widow, get her promise black and white, Goldfinch going</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Turns]</stage> Tellee I must have 'em,</p>

<p>I see nothing curious about it,</p>

<p>Indeed but don't you think it, I would not give this tiny bit of paper, no, not for a diamond as big—as big as the whole world,—And if you were to téll ma', and she were to take it from me, I'd never love you, nor forgive you, as long as I live.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>You are a very shocking person, Mr Sulky,—The wild man of the woods broke loose, do return to your keeper, good Orang Outang; and don't go about to terrify the children!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>I tell you, madam, Mr Milford is arrested,</p>

<p>My brother;</p>

<p>And pray now what is that to me,</p>

<p>I am not arrested,</p>

<p>Would you were!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Oh the savage!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>The pitiless only should feel pain. The stonyhearted alone should be enclosed by walls of stone,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Don't be cross with ma', sir; I'm sure she'll release my brother,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>You are sure, minikin!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Yes, ma'; for I am sure no soul on earth would suffer a fellow creature to lie and pine to death, in a frightful dark dungeon, and fed with bread and water:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Your late husband recommended the payment of his son's debts,</p>

<p>Recommended?</p>

<p>Yes,</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>More's the pity,</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Which prudence I shall follow,</p>

<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>It will be the first time in your life—You never yet followed prudence, you always ran before it;</p>

<p>Nay come, dear ma', I am sure you have a pitiful heart! I am sure you could not rest in your bed if my poor brother was in prison!</p>

</sp>
<stage>Enter Servant and Mr SILKY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Mr Silky, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Leave us, Jenny. <stage>[Exit Jenny]</stage> So, Mr Silky—What is this very urgent business of yours?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Looking round]</stage> Are we safe, madam? Will nobody interrupt us; nobody over-hear us?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>No, no—But what is the meaning of this caution?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p><stage>[After fastening the door and carefully drawing the Will from his pocket]</stage> Do you know this hand-writing, madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Ah!—It is my poor old dear man's, I see.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>You have heard of a will he left in France?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! Will indeed? He left no will!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Yes, he did, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>I won't believe it! He loved me too well to rob me of a single guinea! Poor simple soul! I was his darling!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>His darling madam!—With your permission, I will just read a single clause in which his darling is mentioned! Look, madam; it is thealderman's hand! <stage>[Reads]</stage> But as I have sometimes painfully suspected the excessive affection which my said wife, Winifred Warren, professed for me during my decline, and that the solemn protestations she made never to marry again, should she survive me, were both done with sinister views, it is my will that, should she marry, or give a legal promise of marriage, written or verbal, that she shall be cut off with an annuity of six hundred a year; and the residue of my effects in that case to be equally divided between my natural son, John Milford, and my wife's daughter, Sophia Freelove.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Six hundred a year! An old dotard! To imagine that a woman of my elegant ideas could exist on six hundred a year! Brute! Monster! I hate him now as heartily as when he was alive: But pray, sir, how came you by this will?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="38" facs="37"/>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Why it was odd enough! And yet easy enough! My name is Silky, madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Well?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>And you know the executor's name is Sulky—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Well?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>The gentleman that delivered it only made a mistake of a letter, and give it to Mr. Silky instead of to Mr. Sulky!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>And where is that gentleman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil,</speaker>
<p>Ah, poor man! He is dead!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid,</speaker>
<p>Dead?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>And gone! Was taken ill the very night he parted from me, went to his hotel, was put to bed in a high fever, and carried off in less than a week.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>And does Mr Sulky know of this will being delivered?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Not a syllable! It's all close and smooth!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>So much the better—Come, give it me, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Excuse me there, madam! I can't do that!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Why so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>My conscience won't let me! I must provide for my family!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>And pray what provision is this will to make for your family, Mr Silky?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Why, madam. I have a proposal—You know the power of your own charms!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Which I believe is more than you do, Mr Silky—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Hah! Don't say so, madam! Don't say so!—Would I were a handsome, rich and wellborn youth! But you know Mr Goldfinch?—Ah, ha, ha, ha! I could tell you a secret!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid</speaker>
<p>What, that he is dying for me, I suppose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Ah! So smitten!—Talks of nothing else!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>And is that any secret, think you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>The alderman I find died worth more than a plum and a half—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Well?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>I have talked the matter over with my friend, Mr Goldfinch, and he thinks it but reasonable, that for a secret of so much importance, which would almost sweep the whole away, I should receive one third.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Fifty thousand pounds, Mr Silky?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>I can't take less.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Why you are a greater rogue than even I thought you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="39" facs="38"/>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Lord, madam, it's no roguery! It's only a knowledge of the world! A young husband and a hundred thousand pounds, or poor six hundred a year without any husband!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>You are a very shocking old miser, Mr Silky! A very repulsive sort of a person! What heart you had is turned to stone! You are insensible of the power of a pair of fine eyes! But I have made a conquest that places me beyond your reach—I mean to marry Mr Dornton!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Surprised]</stage> What! Old Mr Dornton, madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Old Mr Dornton, man?—I never saw the figure in my life! No! The gay and gallant young Mr Dornton! The pride of the city, and the lawful monarch of my bleeding heart!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Young Mr Dornton!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>So you may take your will and light your fires with it! You will not make a penny of it in any other way. Mr. Sulky, the executor is Mr. Dornton's partner, and when I marry Mr Dornton he will never inflict the absurd penalty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! No, madam! When you marry Mr Dornton, that he certainly never will! But if any accident should happen to prevent the match, you will then let me here from you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Lord, good man! Don't mention the horrid idea? Do leave me to my delightful meditations! I would indulge in soft sensibility and dreams of bliss; and not be disturbed by dead men's wills, or the sordid extortions of an avaricious old rogue!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Very well, madam! The secret for the present remains between ourselves! You'll be silent for your own sake! Only remember, ha, ha, ha! If you should want me, I live at number 40. My name is on the door. Ha, ha, ha! Mr. Dornton! Good morning, madam: Mr. Dornton: Ha, ha, ha! You'll send if you should want me? <stage>[Exit laughing</stage></p>

<p>Your son, sir, made me what I am; redeemed me and my family from ruin; and it would be an ill requital of his goodness to come here, like a dun, at such a time as this; when I would rather, if that could help him, give him every shilling I have in the world,</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ho.</speaker>
<p>Mr Dornton, sir, knew I should be unwilling to come, and sent me word he would never speak to me more if I did not: and, rather than offend him, I would even come here on a business like this,</p>

Then if there are any of Dornton's bills to be bought at fifty per cent. discount, let me know.

<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Madam?—None, I thank you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>A morsel of seed-cake, a French biscuit, a bit of orange-loaf, a glass of Constantia, or a jelly?—I know these little cordial comforts are agreeable consolations to gentlemen of your cloth.</p>

<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>

<sp>

<p>Then I dare say you have a great regard for him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Hem!—Yes—I—had a—sort of a friendship for him even before he was born.</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Ay indeed, is he so odd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Sometimes—To my great regret, I have sometimes found him a very absurd old gentleman,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>I am sorry for it—Because as <hi>I</hi> am soon to become—hymeneally—his intimate—relation—<hi>I—I</hi>—!</p>

<p>Ha, I dare not say too much in his favour,</p>

<p>Do you think so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>I am sure so!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>I warrant, sir, he is, as you say, a very precise acrimonious person—A tetchy repugnant kind of old gentleman.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>I said no such thing, madam!</p>
</sp>

<p>Dear sir, let us fly to console poor Milford!</p>

<stage>Enter <hi>MILFORD</hi> and Mr <hi>SULKY.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>The fool Go ldfinch himself informed me, sir, that Silky is to receive fifty thousand pounds for his consent!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Fifty thousand! Zounds! Why then the old scoundrel must have got possession of the will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>Which is ind ubitably meant to be destroyed. Goldfinch is just returned with Silky. They are now with
<pb n="72" facs="71"/>
the widow, all in high glee, and are coming up here immediately, no doubt to settle the business in private.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>What can be done?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>We must hide ourselves somewhere, and spring upon them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>I hate hiding! It's deceit, and deceit is the resource of a rascal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>But there is no avoiding it! We cannot get legal assistance in time! Here are two closets! Do you go into one, and I'll shut myself up in the other. We shall hear what they are about, and can burst upon them at the proper moment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Well, if it must be so—But it's a vile, paltry refuge!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>I hear them coming! Make haste!</p>
<stage>[Exeunt Sulky and Milford into the closets.</stage>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SILKY, WIDOW, <hi>and</hi> GOLDFINCH.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! I told you, madam, I should hear from you when you wanted me! I knew it must come to that! But you are a lucky man. Mr Goldfinch, and I'am a lucky man! ay and you are a lucky woman too, madam! We are all in luck!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Ay dammee, old one, you have been concerned in many a good thing in your time!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha! To be sure I have! I must provide for my family, Mr. Goldfinch!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>It is indeed a fortunate event! Do you not participate my raptures, Mr Goldfinch?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>To be sure—It's a deep scheme! It's knowing a thing or two! Hay, old one? Pigeoning the Green horns!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>All so safe too, so snug! I am so pleased, and so happy! It's all our own! Not a soul will know of it but our three selves!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Oh yes—One more, old one—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Alarmed]</stage> Ay! Who? Who?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Your father—Beelzebub!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Lord! Mr Goldfinch, don't terrify me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>To be sure, it must be owned you are a shocking old rogue, Mr Silky! But there is no doing without you—So make haste with your deeds and your extortions; for really we should be glad to be rid of your company—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="73" facs="72"/>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, I'm ready—I'll not long interrupt your amorous haste. I am a man of business! I expected how it would be, and have a legal instrument here, ready drawn up by my own hand; which, when it is signed and sealed, will make all safe!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>But where is the will?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Oh I have it—First however let us be secure. <stage>[Locks both the chamber doors: is going to read, but looks round, sees the closet doors, and with great anxiety and cunning locks them too.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>You're an old trader in sin! There's no being too deep for you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Ah, ha, ha, ha! Do you think so, Mr Goldfinch?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>But I should like to see you on your death-bed!</p>
<stage>[A blow from one of the closets.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Bless my soul!—What's that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! Odd enough! I believe he's coming for you before your time!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>It was very strange!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>I declare I am all of a tremble!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, let us get the shocking business over!—Where is the will?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Don't shake so man!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Well, well!—First sign the bond! <stage>[Widow and Goldfinch going to sign, another knock heard]</stage> Lord have mercy upon me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>I smell sulpher!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Save me, Mr Goldfinch!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>The candles burn blue! <stage>[Pause</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! Zounds, it is only some cat in the closet!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>I heard it in both the closets!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold,</speaker>
<p>Why then there are two cats!—Come! I'll sign—</p>
<stage>[Widow and Goldfinch sign the bond</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Where's the promise?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Here it is! <stage>[Laying it on the table</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>And here is the will, which, that all may be safe, we will immediately commit to the flames. <stage>[Is going to burn it at the candle. Four successive loud knocks are heard, one from each of the doors. Silky starts, drops one candle, and overturns the other. The stage dark,]</stage></p>

<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Lord have mercy upon us!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>My hair stands an end!</p>
<stage>[Violent knocking at both closets and at the doors.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="74" facs="73"/>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Save me, Mr. Goldfinch! Protect me! Ah!</p>
<stage>[Shrieks.</stage>
</sp>
<stage>[Sulky and Milford burst open the closets and seize on the bond and promise: then open the chamber doors, at one of which enter Jenny with lights, and at the other Sophia, Harry Dornton, and Mr Dornton.]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Dear, ma', what's the matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Where is the will? <stage>[Silky recovers himself and snatches it up]</stage> Give it me, you old scoundrel! Give it me this instant, or I'll throttle you!</p>
<stage>[Wrests it from him,</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>So, gentlemen! You are a pretty pair of knaves!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>And you are a very worthy lady!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Don't talk to me, man!—Don't talk to me!—I shall never recover my senses again!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>What has happened, gentlemen? How came you thus all locked up together?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Are you here, Mr. Silky?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Yes! There's the honest, grateful, friendly Mr. Silky! Who would betray his friends, plunder the living, and defraud the dead, for the ease of his conscience, and to provide for his family!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Old one! You're done up!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>And here is the girlish old coquette, who would rob her daughter and leave her husband's son, to rot in a dungeon, that she might marry the first fool she could find.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Widow! You are dished! <stage>[Sulky examines the will]</stage> Lost your last chance!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>A broken gamester, nurtured in idleness, ignorance, and dissipation, whose ridings, racings, and drivings are over, and whose whole train of horses, dogs, curricles, phaetons, and fooleries must come to the hammer immediately, is no great loss.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Oh, la! And what is coming to the hammer?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Oh, the hammer is an instrument by which Folly is publickly knocked down to the best bidder; after which she rises, gambols, whisks away, makes a short flying tour, and gallops back to be publickly knocked down again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>"Dear!—Poor Mr Goldfinch,"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>I knew your father, sir: 'tis happy for him that he is dead! If you will forsake these courses and apply to trade—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="75" facs="74"/>
<speaker>Gold.</speaker>
<p>Damn trade; Who's for the spring meeting? Cross 'em and wind 'em! seven to five you don't name the winner! I'm for life and a curricle! A cut at the caster, and the long odds! damn trade, the four aces, a back hand, and a lucky nick! I'm a deep one: That's your sort! <stage>[Exit,</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>And now, madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Keep off, monster! You smell of malice, cruelty and persecution!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>No, madam: I smell of honesty! A drug you nauseate, but with which you must forcibly be dosed;—I have glanced over the will, and find <hi>I</hi> have the power:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<p>Let me go, goblin!—You are a hideous person, and I hate the sight of you! Your breast is flint!—Flint! Unfeeling Gorgon, and I abominate you:</p>
<stage>[Exit into an inner chamber,</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p>Nah, you are a kind, good, cross old soul; and I am sure you will forgive my poor ma', we ought all to forget and forgive: Ought not we, Mr Dornton,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p><stage>[With rapture, and looking to his father]</stage> do you hear her, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>Harry has told me of your innocent, pure, and unsuspecting heart—I love you for having called me an ugly monster;</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<p><stage>[To Harry]</stage> La, Mr Dornton, how could you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Harry—Give me your hand—You have a generous and a noble nature! But your generosity would have proved more pernicious than even your dissipation. No misfortunes, no not the beggary and ruin of a father, could justify so unpricipled a marriage!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>And now <stage>[To Mr Sulky]</stage> my friend,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mil.</speaker>
<p>My father—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>My—!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Whoo! If you wish to get another word from me to night, have done. <stage>[Turning to Silky]</stage> <hi>I</hi> hate fawning!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Mr Sulky, you will have your humour,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>The undiscriminating generosity of this young man supported you in your day of distress; for which, serpent-like, you turned to sting your preserver,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<p>Ah, you will have your humour,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sul.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and it is my humour to see that your villany shall be exposed in its true colours. Hypocrisy, falsehood, and fraud, are your familiars. To screen
<pb n="76" facs="76"/>
your avarice, you made it believed that this gentleman had been the cause of lodging the detainders, and had done the dirty work of which even you were ashamed. But the creditors receive their full demand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dorn.</speaker>
<p>The proposal is just. Listen to that worthy man; and if you can, be honest with a good grace. Every thing will then be readily adjusted, and I hope to the satisfaction of all parties.</p>
