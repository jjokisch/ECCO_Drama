<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>WRITTEN BY WILLIAM THOMAS FITZGERALD, ESQ.</byline>
<byline>AND SPOKEN BY MR. MURRAY.</byline>
<lg>
<l>TO please the town is not a task severe,</l>
<l>Wit will command a smile, distress a tear!</l>
<l>And he, whose moral picture plainly shews</l>
<l>The tree of vice can bear no fruit but woes!</l>
<l>That, tho' successful long in fashion's reign,</l>
<l>The villain's wages are disgrace and pain;</l>
<l>But that the good, by bounty wisely given,</l>
<l>Can make this vale of tears resemble heav'n!</l>
<l>With new-born comfort hush the widow's sigh,</l>
<l>And wipe the tear from pallid mis'ry's eye!</l>
<l>The Bard, who thus employs his useful pen,</l>
<l>Imprints his drama on the hearts of men;</l>
<l>Commands respect from age, applause from youth,</l>
<l>And makes the stage assist the CAUSE OF TRUTH.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet, has an author many an anxious fear,</l>
<l>As his probationary night draws near:</l>
<l>When to his friends the manuscript is read,</l>
<l>Each social critic nods the approving head;</l>
<l>Most yield him flatt'ry—some with jaundic'd eye</l>
<l>Glance at a fault, and at a beauty sigh.</l>
<l>But these are few—true genius still delights</l>
<l>To gaze with rapture at the Muse's slights!</l>
<l>And scorns to triumph at a brother's fall,</l>
<l>When Fame's wide dome is large enough for <hi>all!</hi></l>
<l>Tho' none shall mount where Shakspeare sits sublime▪</l>
<l>The drama's monarch to the end of time!</l>
<l>Within that fane they each a wreath may wear,</l>
<l>Which nature's darling offspring hallow'd there—</l>
<l>And seated at the base of Shakspeare's throne,</l>
<l>Feel some small portion of his fire their own!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus, if they knew their int'rest, wits wou'd be</l>
<l>By friendship bound in one great family;</l>
<l>And, if deserving, all might reap the bays</l>
<l>From the rich harvest of the Public praise.</l>

<head><hi>SCENE I.</hi>—<stage>An Apartment in <hi>OLD VISORLY'S</hi> House. <hi>OLD VISORLY</hi> and Lady <hi>JEMIMA</hi> at breakfast. <hi>OLD VISORLY</hi> reading Newspapers.</stage></head>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY JEMIMA.</speaker>
<p>A Very pleasant, sociable companion, indeed, Mr. Visorly! can you pore over newspapers at no other time? You compliment me most highly in letting me see that, while you are in my company, you need other entertainment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>My dear, I beg your pardon. One is anxious, you know, for the good of one's country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>You are anxious, Mr. Visorly, for any thing that is to shew disrespect to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Lord how you talk—I shew disrespect to you! <stage>(still reading.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>There! are you not still inattentive to me and my remonstrances? Ah! I might have known what I had to expect. This is the consequence of losing sight of what was due to my birth and rank, and marrying a commoner.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>My dear Lady Jemima, why shou'd you urge that so often? I am sensible of the honor, and of my own unworthiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>Still you pay no attention to what I
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
am complaining of. Any thing, I find, is preferable to my conversation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Never spoke a truer word in her life <stage>(aside.)</stage> My dear, I shall have done in a moment—I am among the deaths.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>I wish to the Lord you were.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Oh fie, fie, Lady Jemima!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>You would provoke the patience of a saint. <stage><hi>[OLD VISORLY</hi> starts up, he has been still reading.]</stage> What is the matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Tol lol de rol! <stage>(singing and capering.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>The man is mad.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Tol lol de rol!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>What frenzy has seized you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Frenzy, my dear! only the frenzy that arises from good news.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>Can't you give utterance to your good news without such absurdity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, I will, my dear, <stage>(reads)</stage> "On Thursday, the 14th of last March, died at an advanced age, at Calcutta in Bengal"—Tol lol de rol!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>Oh, mad, mad!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>"John Cleveland, Esq.—his immense wealth devolves on his only son, who is shortly expected in England." There is a fortune for our dear son, Leonard!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>How do you mean for our Leonard?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Cleveland, the son and heir of the deceased, is my first cousin—I'm his nearest of kin—The old fellow, who is dead, was such a capricious sort of animal, that he might have left every shilling of it away from his own son; but now it is come into his possession, it is in the fair road to our family.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>This, indeed, is welcome news;—and here comes our dear Leonard to partake it.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="3" facs="6"/>
<hi>Enter</hi> LEONARD.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my dear boy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my dear son!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Good morning—How do you do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>Here is news!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my boy, we have news for you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Well, let me have it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Why then—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>No, no, Mr. Visorly—I'll tell it him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I'll save you the trouble—Old Cleveland is dead at Calcutta—his son inherits all his fortune—And the good news is, that their <hi>bulses</hi> and <hi>lacks</hi> may eventually come to our family.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Ay, my boy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Leonard!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I would not give five guineas for the chance of inheritance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>No!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>No. I know a little more of the circumstances than you do. Mr. Cleveland has a daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Poh, poh! some—some—you understand me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Visorly, I am shocked at your indelicate allusions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I wish they were well grounded; but 'tis a melancholy fact, that the daughter is legitimate, and her mother, Cleveland's wife, is living.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Dear me, dear me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>How do you know all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>From the most positive information.—Cleveland's own acknowledgement. He has written to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Really!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Yes—Stating that as we were the nearest, and only male relations he had, to us he has taken the liberty of consigning his remittances—with directions how he wishes them to be invested. Understanding that your residence in London was only casual, and also thinking the trouble of business more suited to my time of life, he thought it better to address his letter to me. In it, he explains all the particulars of his marriage; and recommends his wife and daughter to our attention.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>How—are they not with him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>No. His daughter we may hourly expect—Not being able to settle his affairs immediately on the death of his father, he sent her before him, unwilling to detain her from her mother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>Why, is the mother in England?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Yes;—and has been for several years. His marriage was without the consent of his father, and, for some time, unknown to him—Enraged when he discovered it, he insisted on a separation,—to avoid ruin, which would have been the consequence of his father's resentment, he was forced to comply. The child was suffered to remain with him—The wife was doom'd to return to England, where, for these fifteen years she has lived in retirement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Well, what is to be done?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>They are recommended, it seems, to our attention; but, really, I don't well see how I can reconcile to myself, taking notice of, and introducing to my acquaintances, people, one doesn't know who—and that have been living one doesn't know where,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>What do you talk of? Are they not the
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
wife and daughter of a nabob? Your high-bred friends will worship you for the introduction. Think what will be the magnificence of their house, the splendour of their equipage, the brilliancy of their entertainments. Such suppers as theirs will be the fashionable world would scramble for a seat at, even if they were given by a personage from a hotter place than Bengal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Leonard says very truly. We shall get credit by shewing such gold pheasants to our friends.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Certainly: for all will be charmed with the splendour of their plumage—even those who are so little fashionable as not to attempt plucking the feathers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Well, we must prepare to shew them all possible civility.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, pray let us; for I have something in view that will pay us for our trouble.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>What is that, son?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>The hope of making the young lady a part of our family.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>What an excellent thought! Ah, Leonard, Leonard, you are a cunning rogue!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>You amaze me, child, that you don't extend your views—My son, the grandson of the earl of Castlegreat, ought to aspire to the proudest heiresses of the noblest peers—not stoop to a thing of mushroom growth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Consider, mother, <hi>this</hi> mushroom is the growth of a golden soil.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>Well, son, pursue your own inclinations; my affection for you will always make me yield to your wishes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Then this glorious fortune may be mine. Invite them to your house. The mother having
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>
long experienced a constrained seclusion from society, will, doubtless, be gratified with attentions from a woman of your rank—the daughter is young—I don't despair of success with her; and the preference the father has shewn, in the trust consigned to me, makes me hope every thing from him. So, all seems fair for my success; and half a million at least is the prize. Think of that—think of that.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Servant.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>A person below desires to speak with you, Sir. <stage>(to Leonard.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>What is his name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>He says his own name is immaterial; but he desired me to mention the name of Cleveland.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leonard.</speaker>
<p>Shew him up directly.</p>
<stage>[Exit <hi>Servant,</hi> and enter <hi>OAKWORTH.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You are welcome, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Thank you, Sir; thank you. So, I be got to you at last. You great folks take a plaguy time coming at. Ma'am, your humble servant. Mayhap, I should say your Ladyship—Pray excuse all faults.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Never mind, Lady Jemima doesn't stand on ceremony.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Don't she? Why, then, Lady Jemima is a lady just after my own heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir—you come concerning Mr. Cleveland.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Why, yes, Sir; yes. You must know, Sir, that I am an old fellow that remember Mrs. Cleveland (Heaven bless her!) when she was not the height of my knee. Often and often is the time that I have danced her o'top of it. Well, that is neither here nor there. When her father
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>
died—Ah! I shall never forget it—he has not left a better man behind him—there was not a dry eye in the village except the undertaker's, and folks do say he cried a bit. Well, her father, good soul! had met with so many losses and crosses, that there was little enough left for his daughter to live like a lady on; so she was persuaded by her friends to take a voyage to India with a cousin of her's, who had married, and was going to settle there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Cleveland has acquainted me with the rest. There he married her, and from thence, by the severity of his father, he was forced to send her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Ah, poor dear! home she came again, miserable enough, to be sure. Well, mayhap, all for the best; now she will be as happy as the day is long. But for this many a year she has led but a lonesome sort of a life; for you may think my dame and I, though we love her like a child of our own, can't have been company good enough for her: but she was as kind to us, and made as much of us, as though we had been the best people in the land.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>We shall soon, I hope, have the pleasure of receiving her in this house. She must not think of seeing any other habitation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Oh, certainly not. She must make this her abode.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Oh, to be sure; to be sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Why, do you know, now, this is the very thing that came into my head, and that I told her of—Says I, as sure as I am a sinner, if those relations of Mr. Cleveland's have the least bit of kind-heartedness about them, they'll never let you live in any house but their own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Certainly!—How right you were!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>And I am glad to find such friendly good souls in this great town of London;—for, do you know, I had got a notion of its being but a bad sort of a place.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I trust you will find it otherwise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Why. I hope I shall.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>When did Mrs. Cleveland arrive?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>But last night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>And where is she?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Why, she is at a—at a—What the plague do you call it? It is the like of an inn, only it goes by a finer name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Oh, an Hotel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, an Hotel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>But what Hotel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Od rabbit it, I forget the name of it; but I can ask the man who shewed me the way here; for, as I never was in London before, I can't travel without a guide. He waits below to take me back again—he will tell me <stage>(going.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>
<p>Stay, Sir, he shall direct us both. The carriage is waiting, and I will not lose a moment in paying my respects to Mrs. Cleveland.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Well, now, that is kind of you, indeed, my lady. I will leave the direction below stairs, and go on before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>By no means. Lady Jemima will take you in the carriage with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Why, you are joking sure!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Jem.</speaker>

<sp>
<stage>Manet LEONARD.</stage>
<p>If my designs succeed, on what a pinnacle of fortune shall I be placed! The independence bequeathed me by my grandfather I have turned to good account. What, though it has been the means of effecting the ruin of a few thoughtless profligates? There vices were incurable, and they would have been as completely beggared by the skilful operations of others if all my thoughts had been engaged in the exercise of devotion, and my guineas appropriated to charitable donations—Nay, to preserve my estimation with the world, I have raised from the earth those whom others, less mindful of opinion, would have left groveling in misery.—Psha! when I scrutinize my conduct with an eye half inclined to condemnation, I find matter for praise instead of censure. Dupes will be dupes—Knaves will make their prey of them—and lucky is the dupe that becomes the prey of a knave with some conscience, and a great regard for a good reputation. Whom have we here?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Peace be unto this house!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Who is this? With what Hedge Divine have I the honour of an acquaintance?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Thy name is Leonard Visorly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir, what is your business?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>To discourse with thee on the state of thy conscience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I request you will save yourself that trouble: my conscience is a charge of which I choose to have the sole guardianship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>But it is my duty to inquire whether thou hast treated that precious charge like unto a faithful guardian—Whether thou hast not stained with guilt, that which was consigned to thy care spotless and pure; and which now goads thee with complainings for thy iniquity. Therefore, I say—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You shall say no more in this house. Out with you directly <stage>(offering to push him out).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Leonard, Leonard, is this the way you treat an old friend, after so long an absence?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>An old friend!—What do you mean? Who are you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>And so, my reverend appearance has concealed from your recognition your friend, and brother in iniquity, Jeremy Sharpset!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Sharpset!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>The very same.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>But what is the meaning of this transformation?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>The restlessness of my disposition, and inclination for any pursuit in preference to laudable exertion, and honest industry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You always had a propensity to confess your faults.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but not much propensity to amend them. To be sure I shewed a little disposition towards it by quitting you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Your most humble servant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>I am afraid you felt the loss of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I confess it—You were very serviceable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I was. I did the roguery, and you received the profits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Come, come—You were not ill paid.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Oh, no—I don't complain. How is poor Drooply?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Still the creature of my bounty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Well, that is kind of you—A generous weakness in your character—You swindled him out of two thousand a year, and are good enough to allow him a hundred. Ah, you are a model of philanthropy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Come, a truce with your sarcasm.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Ah, bless your honest tender heart! He is as grateful to you as ever, I conclude.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Yes, he esteems me his friend and preserver.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Poor fellow! "He was wont to set the table in a roar, now quite chop-fallen." I declare I never think of him but with a heart-ache.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Well, well—but what have you been doing since we parted?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>All sorts of things I ought not to do. To confess the truth, the reason I quitted you, was, I was tired of the work you chalked out for me—You wanted to push me a little farther in roguery than I liked. I am but a petty larceny villain—That ruin of poor Drooply, in which I was the chief engine for you—that hit me hard. I am foolish enough to have qualms. I know you despise me for it; but we all have our weaknesses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Well, well; but what became of you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you. I had unluckily, once in my life, dined at a Lord Mayor's feast.—I shall never forget it. Talk of Earls and Dukes entertaining!—Psha! a rivulet to the ocean. Ever after I panted for City honours—So, all my <hi>honest</hi> earnings I was determined to deposit in trade. An opportunity soon offered—I was to become a sleeping partner in a great house. I paid down my cash to the last guinea—A docket was struck against the firm the very next week, so the poor sleeping partner had nothing but the open air for his slumbers; and, instead of being in the road to claim a seat at a Guildhall dinner, I had scarcely enough to purchase one in Porridge Island.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>So, all your hopes of a gold chain vanished?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and I was in a very likely way to be adorned with an iron one;—but I was resolved to take myself out of the reach of temptation and danger, by leaving London.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>In what capacity did you travel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Still I had a taste for partnership. I engaged with a very respectable Gentleman to divide with him the attention and profits of—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Of what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>A collection of wild beasts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I guess you were not a sleeping partner here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>No; my companions were rather hostile to repose. Not much liking such uncivilized society, and being a little apprehensive that my fellow-travellers might one time or other make a supper of me, I soon cut this connection; and instead of exhibiting the merits of others, I got a taste for displaying my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>How, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>I joined a party of strolling players.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>I know you must be shocked at my descending so damn'd low as to turn actor. But I did not disgrace myself long.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>How happened that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>The audience would not let me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>How so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>I came out in Richard the Third. I thought it devilish fine; but the good folks in the front thought otherwise. I ranted—they hooted—However, I out-roared them, and pushed on till I got into Bosworth Field—"A horse, a horse! my kingdom for a horse!" When a drunken, Foxhunting squire (I shall never lose the sound of his damn'd voice) bawled out of the boxes, that I should have the best horse in his stable, if I would ride away directly, and never come back again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>The actor's warn'd me it would not do. I thought it envy in them, and have some reason to think they sent in a party to hiss me. However, by way of comfort, they told me, though I should never act tragedy, they thought I should succeed in low comedy—Low comedy! only think of their impudence! Is this a face for low comedy? No, no, damn it! I could not stoop to that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Well, your next resource?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Oh, then I got a call, and mounted the habiliments in which you see me; this was lucrative; but my conscience would not suffer me any longer to drain from the pockets of the poor, the earnings of their industry: nay, what is worse, embitter their innocent minds with groundless terrors, and inspire them with prejudice against their fellow-creatures.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>So then you deign at last to return to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="17"/>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Yes; for I had rather cheat the rich, than delude the poor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, I'll endeavour to find you employment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>That I don't doubt, as long as there is a pigeon to be plucked, and as I am disposed to be a rook at your service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>No, I have at present honester objects in view, to attain which I may need your assistance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Well, I'm glad of that; for, upon my soul, I am tired of being a rogue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>If I reach the point of my present aim, I may, myself, relinquish that character. I shall then have wealth enough to gratify even <hi>my</hi> ambition. I am no further a knave than as it forwards my grand pursuit, the attainment of wealth. And who would not use any means to gain that, which covers vice with the garb of respect, and without which virtue meets but pity or derision.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Well observed; and never was observation more patly illustrated. You are a glorious instance of the first part of your sentiment, and here comes a proof of the latter.</p>

<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Where have you hid yourself? nobody has seen you of late?</p>

<p>I have been striving to follow the example of my acquaintances, and learning to be as shy of them as they are of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Why, what an altered being you are! you used to be a merry fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Yes, for I used to be a rich fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="18"/>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, cheer up. Good spirits are a man's best friends.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Ay; but like the rest of his friends, when his money leaves him, they leave him too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay; your friends have not all deserted you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>All but you. There is not another man in the world who would care a straw if the devil had one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>If you are so despondent, I must recommend you a spiritual comforter. Can your reverence administer consolation to this afflicted being? <stage><hi>(to</hi> Sharpset.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>No; for I can't return him the money I won of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Whom have we here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>What, not remember me! If I had done you a kindness, I might expect to be forgotten▪ but I thought every one remembered an ill-turn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>In this pious pastor you behold a quondam acquaintance, Mr. Sharpset.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>What! Sharpset turned Methodist?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Yes; but don't wrong my understanding—Only from necessity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You might triumph now, if you were disposed to indulge spleen; for the man who was the chief gainer by your losses at play, is now as low in the world as yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>No, I am so completely without gratification, I have not even the comfort a malicious disposition would afford me. It is far from a relief to me, to see another unfortunate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You are mutually distressed; yet, how differently you bear your misfortunes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>That is easily accounted for. I have a thousand resources—Drooply has none. Born to no other inheritance, I have learned to turn to account
<pb n="16" facs="19"/>
what I inherit from nature; so that, tho' my acquisitions have been squandered, I am still in possession of my original patrimony.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Ah, you lucky dog! you have an estate in every corner of your brain, and a pretty income at the end of every finger. Now, the whole produce of my skull would not get me change for sixpence: and as for my hands, curse them! they are fit for nothing but to dangle by my sides, or stuff out my coat-pockets.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Why, I am afraid they will never fill your pockets with any thing but themselves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Oh I wish I had been a Turk!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>A Turk!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Yes, a Turk: they are the only wise people on earth: they teach all their great men some honest employment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Do they? I know some great men I wish they would give a lesson to.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Oh if we had that good mussulman custom among us, how many a rich man would be of more use to society when his estate was gone, than while he possessed it! as a good cobler is a more valuable character than a rich man who does not employ his wealth properly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Why, you are turning moralist!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Yes; the loss of wealth seldom lessens a man's morality. While I am creeping about, such a piece of moving lumber, what respect I feel for every reputable tinker that comes in my way. This very morning how I did envy a merry rogue of a shoeblack! With what glee he put the polish of an artist on the boot he was blacking: how merrily he brushed and sung, and how conceitedly and happily he looked at his work when he had done it! Oh, you jolly dog, thought I, what a happy man had been spoiled, if you had been born
<pb n="17" facs="20"/>
to two thousand a year! you would never have enjoyed the luxury of polishing a shoe, or the independent exultation of existing by your own industry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>We must endeavour to dispel your melancholy. You are a martyr to <hi>ennui.</hi> I must find you employment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>You must do something beside—find me capacity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>That you don't want. Your talents have been only slumbering.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Hav'n't they? they have had a pretty long nap, and a sound one too. I'm afraid it will be a hard matter to wake them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I don't despair; especially when I shall set the loud voice of friendship to rouse them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>If they don't wake at that call, you may take your oath their slumber is everlasting. But tho' I am master of this poor tenement, I really am so ignorant of the state of the <hi>upper story,</hi> as not to know whether the inhabitants have perished by neglect, or are only dozing from want of employment; but this I do know, there is a lively fellow in the <hi>first floor</hi> <stage>(pointing to his heart)</stage> who would dance with joy to do you the slightest service, and lose every drop of blood to prove his friendship and gratitude. <stage>[Exeunt.</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Well, my dear brother, I am so glad we are to have our house full of company—Oh, that is delightful! How I do love a racketting, noisy scene! In a morning the fashionable bustle of Bondstreet, the musical thunder of a footman's rap—the dealing out tickets to the whole <hi>ton</hi>-world—and then at night, driving to twenty different assemblies—seeing the whole world in the course of an evening—Oh, dear, dear, what a charming age to live in! we see more of life in one day, than our ancestors did in their whole existence.</p>

<p>Well, I'm not Cynic enough to attempt to reason people out of their notions of happiness; for as it exists in imagination, the idea is the

reality. But, my dear Caroline, I have told you my wish to be thought well of by this young East Indian. From living in the same house, and being nearly of an age, you will most likely contract a friendship.</p>

<p>Heaven grant it! I have passed many a tedious year with no other solace than the hope of what now appears so near me. Fifteen years' absence from the husband of my affections, and from my dear child, has been a period, you may well conceive, barren of comfort:—and, even now, I have much to dread—a long and dangerous voyage.—But I will hope the best, and not wrong Providence, by doubting its goodness.</p>

<p>Her affection for my dear child makes her certain of my love. But I feel exhausted with excess of joy. We should not lament that there are few incidents in life, which waken such extreme delight; for were they frequent, how shortly would our weak frames yield to the tumults of ecstacy!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Hush, sir, hush! <stage>(to Oakworth.)</stage> Wha delight, sir, you must feel at the happiness of this family, to whom you have shewn so much attachment! What gratitude do they not owe you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Gratitude to me! That is a great mistake of yours, and it behoves me to set you right. Mrs. Cleveland's father saved me once from ruin—me and my family from beggary; and I think he must have but a bad notion of the value of a kindness done him, who, if he could live long enough, would not strive to repay it down to the fiftieth generation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>What a noble heart!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Noble heart! Psha, psha! sure the world is not so bad that a man need be praised for not being a monster.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I am proud of the happiness of being known to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>And so am I, most sincerely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Why to be sure a mighty matter to be proud of, gentlemen, being known to an old stupid country bumpkin. Surely you be jeering a body—but if you be, I can't find in my heart to be angry; for as long as you are so good and so kind to the dear creatures I love, you may flout and jeer at me as much as you please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You mistake us extremely: it is the farthest from our thoughts to be deficient in any particle of respect.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear! we never dreamed of such a thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Well, I suppose I shall be able in time to understand your London speechifying; but in truth your fine civil sayings are so like making
<pb n="24" facs="27"/>
game, that, for a little while, I shall be deucedly puzzled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You never can be at a loss for our meaning—We feel the value of such integrity as yours; and be assured we shall always say less of your merits, than we think you deserve.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Always less than you deserve.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Do you know I shall take that very kind of you—for if you are so good as to fancy I have any deserts at all, you must in conscience think they be very little—And if so be you keep your word, and say less than you think, I shall be mighty happy—because then, you will just say nothing at all. So, gentlemen, as in duty bound, I am your most humble servant. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>

<p>Poor old fellow—Age begins to make havock—the upper works are giving way.</p>

<p>Ah, sir! how few like you, enjoy in advanced life, robustness of form, vigour of intellect,—in short, all the advantages of youth, without its inexperience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Very few indeed, Leonard—I am one out of five thousand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Years in you, sir, have only just slackened the blazing fire of youth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Yes—slackened—not extinguished it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>This old rustic, sir, appears to stand vastly well with the mother; I must endeavour to gain his good graces; for the sentiments of a man she has known so long, and esteems so highly, must have great weight with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Very true—I'll take care to pay him vast attention. I'll do your business with him—I'll cajole the old fool.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Now the game is started, I must set my whole pack full cry for the chace. Here comes my prime agent in knavery, Sharpset. Having used him so essentially in the plunder of Drooply, and that business completed, I could have dispensed with his return; for no intercourse is so grating as that which subsists with a confederate in villainy. However, to keep him in my power, I have still contrived to keep him in my debt; so that I need not fear him, and he has talents to render him still useful to me.</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SHARPSET.</stage>
<p>I am glad to find you return'd to the laity. I would rather see knavery wear any garb than that of religion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Your reason for which, is, that then only you are afraid of its being an overmatch for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Not so; but that I have not ceased to respect, tho' I have dared to violate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Heyday! I believe you congratulate me on laying down the trade of preaching, because you mean to take it up. But it tells well for morality, that even some knaves can admire the cause, which honest men are risking their lives to defend. But, a truce to this style, for it sits awkwardly upon us. Your visitors, I find, are arrived.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and the girl is beautiful as an angel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Oh, a divinity!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Why, have you seen her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="26" facs="29"/>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Then, whence these raptures?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Did not you tell me she was heiress to half a million?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Oh! your servant—but I assure you her intrinsic worth—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Can be nothing to her <hi>sterling</hi> worth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I am convinced I feel something like love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>To be sure you do. I should adore a twentieth part of the sum, if it were in the pocket of the ugliest old harridan that ever was ducked for a witch.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You seem to hold beauty very cheap.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Oh no—I only value money very highly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>But when they are combined—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>That is always possible—Whoever has the money, need not be long without the beauty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>In one object I hope to possess the ultimatum of my wishes in both. It must now be my care to have all around her impressed with esteem for me—my eulogium wafted to her on every breath, cannot fail of infusing a favourable prepossession. Be you mindful, that on all occasions your report of me may swell the gale of approbation. I need not tell you that your interest will be no sufferer by your panegyric.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>And I assure you I am so good natur'd a fellow, that, make it equally profitable to me, and I would rather speak in a man's praise than against him—So much am I unlike the greater part of my acquaintance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>The chief personage I wish to enlist in my favour, is an old rustic, much devoted to the family, and ranking high in the mother's esteem. His name is Oakworth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Oakworth.</p>

<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Oak—Oak—worth.—Where does he come from?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>With Mrs Cleveland from Warwickshire. What surprises you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Oh nothing—Only it strikes me, I have heard that name before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Be earnest to throw yourself in his way▪ and remember by discreetly applied praise, to pave my passage to the esteem I desire. To merit esteem is at best a tedious method of obtaining it—The <hi>purchased</hi> diploma equally gives the title, and saves the labour of deserving it. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Manet</hi> SHARPSET.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>So, I am to throw myself in the way of this old rustic, Oakworth—You little guess, my very worthy friend, what you are directing—To throw myself in the way of no less interesting a personage to me than my identical dad—my own natural father. It is now a long while since I saw the good old boy:—I was but fourteen, I think, when it entered my mad head to scamper away from him—A project well worthy of so experienced an age. That frolic has thrown me into many a situation which would be whimsical to relate—Yes, and many a situation it would not be prudent to relate. I long to have a glimpse of the old buck. I wonder whether he would know me—Whom have we got here? Oh! this is one of the Asiatic importations.</p>
<stage>Enter <hi>GANGICA,</hi> looking about with curiosity; on seeing <hi>SHARPSET,</hi> she starts back.</stage>
<p>Don't be fright'ned, my dear—I am very tame.</p>

<speaker>Gang.</speaker>
<p>You not hurt me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Lord love you, not I. I suppose she
<pb n="28" facs="31"/>
thought I shou'd dart at her like one of her native tygers. I assure you, my dear, I sha'n't bite.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gang.</speaker>
<p>No, no; but you may do great deal mischief, and not bite.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>But I won't do any mischief at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gang.</speaker>
<p>Dat's good man. You not wonder I am afraid—I am stranger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a sign so by your being afraid; for, were you not a stranger you would know that nobody in this country has the power of wronging another with impunity. Beside, your being a stranger, is a sure title to protection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gang.</speaker>
<p>O den, dis be very good country. Glad I come here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>And so am I, glad you are come here, my little marigold.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gang.</speaker>
<p>What for you glad I come here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Because I like the look of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gang.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you mock—You not like my copper face.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Why not, my dear? In my mind a lady looks better with a face of copper, than of brass—And that is all the fashion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gang.</speaker>
<p>Oh, if my face were like my dear Miss Julia's! Oh she so pretty! she so good!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>And you love her very much?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gang.</speaker>
<p>Ay, dat I do—I would die for her.—Oh, I would do great deal more—I would live to bear pain in my limbs, and sorrow in my heart, to make her happy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Well said, my little disciple of Brama! If the hallowed waves of the Ganges had any share in infusing this gratitude, I wish its stream lay near enough to be resorted to as a fashionable bathing place. This little sun-burnt favourite may do Leonard service—I'll try to retain her in his cause.

But, my dear, I am not the only handsome gentleman in this house—I mean another, who has conceived a great esteem for your young lady; and your good opinion of him will, I know, give him great satisfaction—and so—but I had better have done with talking, and appeal to the rhetoric of all times, and all nations <stage>(taking out a purse)</stage> you must know, my dear, that this gentleman is very generous—and I am sure he will be highly pleased at my making you a present from him of this little purse. <stage>(gives her the purse.)</stage></p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>No—no; they be all gone <stage>(sighing.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>What—none lest?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>No, no—Yes—one, mayhap—one may be alive—one ungracious boy—No, no; it be hardly possible, though there is a chance, a little chance—I have always kept a watch on the Old Bailey Sessions Papers, and the County Assize lists—and to be sure I never found his name down in them; but there is little certainty or comfort in that—for you know, my poor wicked boy may have been hanged, or sent to Botany Bay under some other name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="34" facs="37"/>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Hanged, or sent to Botany Bay!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Ah! sir, it grieves my heart to think it—but he had such little sharping tricks about him when he was but a child, that I were forced to lash, and lash, every day of my life. I dare say, if he be alive, he have got my well-meant marks on his back to this day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Really! It aches at the recollection. <stage>(aside).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Yes—you must suppose I had his well doing at heart—and so I never spared him. I did hope, by good advice, and good example, and a good horsewhip, all together, to have made an honest man of him—But the rogue scampered away when he was but a younker, and so got loose into the wide wicked world, with a bad disposition, and necessity to whet it. You must needs think as I do, about what is become of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>I really think, sir, you judge too severely of your son, Je—What is your son's name, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Jeremy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>O, sir, take comfort—Many a lad with as bad a beginning has turned out a great man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Ay, a <hi>great</hi> man, mayhap—but I am afraid nobody with so bad a beginning has turned out a <hi>good</hi> one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Upon my soul, you can't think how it shocks me that you should judge so harshly of a child of your own. I dare swear no more harm has happend to Jerry than there has to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>O dear, O dear! it be quite a different case.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Not at all—not at all—A case very much in point, I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>How be that? Why, were you a bit of a rogue when you were a younker?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="35" facs="38"/>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>To own the truth to you, my dear sir, (but don't mention it) I was.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Ah! but you never ran away from your home.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>I did.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>You don't say so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes; but you soon saw your error, and went back to your father?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>So far from it, my good sir, that it was many years before we met.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>And, then, quite by accident.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Really!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and the best joke was, he did not know me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Not know you! Oh the old fool!—Beg pardon, sir, for making so free with your father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>No apology. Pray make as free with him as you please. Was it not droll?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Devilish droll—Ha, ha, ha! I can't help laughing. So, you met him, and he did not know you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>No—he did not know me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Well, and what did he say when he did know you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Why, that, my dear sir, I must defer telling you till another opportunity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir, whenever you please—I long to hear the rest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Depend upon it, sir, it won't be concealed from you. Good day to you, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Good bye, sir. Ha, ha, ha! only think of your own father's not knowing you, ha, ha▪ ha!</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> JULIA <hi>and</hi> CAROLINE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>But you surely won't stay at home this evening too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Yes, indeed I had rather.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>You have the most unaccountable domestic propensity. Has novelty no pleasure for you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Yes, 'tis novelty makes me domestic; a dear novelty, the novelty of a mother. Now I have gained her sweet society, should I resign it for frivolous amusements I can command at all times?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Well, you are a dear, good girl.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>But where are you going this evening?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>That I cannot tell without referring to my engagement list; but as near as I can guess, to about a dozen assemblies, the opera, a concert, and a masqued ball.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>My dear Caroline, you'll be fatigued to death.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Oh, no. I am never weary with pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>And do you often make these laborious exertions for your amusement?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, all through the season—And I don't think that half long enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Well, to be equal to such efforts, a woman of fashion must be endued with more strength than any creature in the universe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>To be sure. Your elephant is nothing to
<pb n="37" facs="40"/>
her; for groveling instinct restrains him from exceeding the paltry limits of mere corporeal exertion; but the elevated spirits, and glowing imagination of a woman of fashion make her a being all essence—She is like the wind, light, fleet, and invincible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>And is she not sometimes like the wind in my native country, which now breathes all gentleness, yet, in a few hours will whirl a whole fortune to destruction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Why, yes, I am afraid there have been instances of the tornado kind. I really don't know whether many men may not be better pleased with your quiet stay-at-home notions, than with more dash and spirit; but perhaps you never yet examined your inclinations with an eye to how a husband would approve them. Ah, Julia, you blush, my dear; I believe this scrutiny has not been unattended to.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>How you talk!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Yes. I <hi>talk,</hi> and you <hi>think;</hi> but both on the same subject. My dear girl, have I yet claim enough on your confidence to ask, if the being I allude to has stolen into your dreams, and been admitted into your waking reveries in the form of a beautiful accomplished youth, whose exact likeness you have never yet realized, or have you already assigned him "A local habitation and a name?"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Heigho!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Oh, then I lay my life Mr. Heigho has a name and place of abode. Am I not right?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>And in what quarter of the globe does he exist?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Nay, where shou'd he? I have not been
<pb n="38" facs="41"/>
long enough in this country to have found him here. I must have met him before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside).</stage> So, my poor brother, your chance is gone. What is his name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Henry Melville.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>And you expect him here, no doubt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, in the same vessel with my father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>And does he know your partiality?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and I know his for me; and my father approves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you happy girl! Now, the man I love neither knows my partiality for him; nor do I know whether he cares at all for me—And if we did know that we cared for each other, I am sure my father would let us care on till both our hearts broke, before he would give his consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Why so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Because the poor dear fellow has lost all his fortune; but luckily my father's consent is not essential, as I have a fortune independent of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Then you are not in a very hopeless state?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, I am: for my lover (my love I should say) lost all self-importance with his fortune; and I very much fear I shall never be able to make him comprehend that a young woman with a good estate is ready to let him be master of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>How strange!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Hints won't do—And if I could bring myself to say to him plainly, "Dear Sir, I adore you!" he would only think I was making a jest of him.</p>

<p>Nay! did not I send for you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>So I understood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>And why do you give me the trouble? You made your visits formerly without being sent for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Did I? Yes. I dare say I was a very troublesome fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Nay, you found those visits always received with pleasure; therefore, it is strange you need be reminded to continue them.</p>
</sp>

<p>My visits received with pleasure! Ah, this is the way in which you always used to banter me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Banter you! Stupidity!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes. I know you are at your old tricks. You were always cutting your jokes at me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>I?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you; and I remember I used to laugh at them; but that was when my pockets were full. Upon my soul, I can't now. No, no,
<pb n="40" facs="43"/>
you must excuse me. I defy a man to laugh at a joke when he has lost all his money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>You strange creature! Do you know that I have been thinking of you a great deal lately?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Yes, I don't doubt it—to play me some trick or other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Silly animal! <stage>(aside)</stage> I have been even dreaming of you—Do you ever dream of me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>I could not think of taking such a liberty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Provoking! Oh, I had almost forgot—I knew I had something particular to tell you. It was whispered to me t'other night at Lady Blab's, that you—(now mind, if it is true, I shan't be angry) that you had told some friend in confidence (now mind, I have promised not to be angry) that you were in love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>I told some friend?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and that delicacy, occasioned by the loss of your fortune had prevented you from declaring your passion to the object of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>I never—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Now do stop a moment; but that if you thought it would be favourably received (—now remember I have promised not to be angry—) you would overcome your diffidence, and reveal it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>I assure you that—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>A moment's patience pray—At last, by great entreaty, I learnt the lady's name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>And what was it?</p>

<p>Now who the devil can have told such a cursed pack of lies of me—All done to ruin me in her good opinion. That I, a poor undone dog, with not a sixpence in the world but what I receive from her brother's friendship—I might say his—charity, should presume to cherish hopes of Caroline Visorly. No, no—all my hopes of her vanished with my fortune. I love her—I do love her; and what a good-natured soul it is not to have flown into a rage at supposing I could be guilty of such vanity—such presumption, such folly—Ay, that—that saved me:—knowing the folly, she pardoned the presumption.</p>

<p>Oh, sir, don't indulge such melancholy ideas. His death, tho' to be sure very dreadful, and likely to awaken sensibility in the breasts of his relations, yet carries with it to us a kind of consolation.</p>

<p>How do you mean, Leonard?</p>

<p>Very true. Lord, what a blockhead was I, to fall a blubbering, and for a man too, who, tho' he was my first cousin, I should not have known from Adam. But I have a very tender heart.</p>

<p>That, I find, is the house of Mr. Visorly. There I shall learn my Julia's residence. This is but a sorry garb for a lover to seek his mistress in; but if I know my Julia's heart, her joy at finding me preserved from death, will make her little heed, or scarcely see the poorness of my raiment.

out, and in a moment throng'd. In one, least crowded, was your father; he called to me, and earnestly conjured me to come into it—As I was going to comply, I saw a poor old man kneeling to heaven to save him from the fate his feeble age denied him to contend against. The boat could safely hold but one—I placed him in it, seized on a friendly coop, and with it trusted to the waves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>My generous Henry! But my father—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>The sea was very boisterous, and often washed over me; yet, at intervals I snatched a short view, and still saw his boat riding in safety. At length the bursting billows showering so frequently their torrents on me, deluged my senses. When I recovered them, I found myself in a small vessel, whose crew had humanely rescued me from death.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>Oh my poor father!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Nay, droop not, Julia—This vessel was a sloop of war sailing for the Downs. Before I recovered, it was under weigh, I was therefore forced to remain in it till it gain'd its station.—Landed at Deal, I could of course hear no tidings of your father, whose boat, no doubt, safely reached the nearest shore. His not being yet arrived, argues nothing against his safety.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>But, would he not have written to acquaint us with it?—News of the wreck could reach us, but no intelligence from him—No, he is gone! My father is gone for ever.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>My Julia's grief distracts me—Still let me hope 'tis without cause; but as no moment should be lost to prove it groundless, I will this instant fly to know the truth▪ Farewell, my Julia! When next we meet, I trust all grief will vanish.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Where have you been? I never wanted your assistance more, and I have been hunting after you of late in vain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Whew! you seem in a blessed humour. What has produced such an amiable tone of temper?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>All my scheme is likely to be ruined. There is a lover, a favoured lover, come to light.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Oh the deuce!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Yes, saved from the wreck—damnation! But there is still one consolation, he brings no tidings of the father. The waves have not spared him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Poor man!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Amiable tenderness!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Mock as you will, I cannot, like you, steel my heart against the common feelings of humanity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Psha! he's dead—Will your preaching reanimate him? No. Then to the purpose of doing service to the living, of aiding your friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>This girl, now the rightful inheritor of her father's immense fortune, must be mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>But you tell me of a lover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and there is not time for endeavouring to undermine his hold on her heart—Measures must be adopted, sudden and forcible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="53" facs="56"/>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>How do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>To bear her away. Once in my possession, all may go smoothly: at her age, nay, at any age, a transfer of affection is no uncommon incident.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>But the difficulty—See how she is surrounded.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Difficulty! every difficulty yields to the enterprising. Her lover is gone, like a true hero of romance, to conjure up the dead. 'Tis easy to get the rest out of the way—First, I'll remove the main obstacle, her rustic protector.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Remove him! how do you mean, remove him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>We must lack invention, indeed, not to effect that—By an hundred stratagems we can keep him out of the way long enough to answer my purpose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>But I have a trifling objection to his being put to the slightest inconvenience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Objection? what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>He only happens to be my father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>What do you say? your father?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>My father!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You astonish me. Well, well, this may turn to account. Then you may have influence to bring him over to my interest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Not I, nor all the world would be able to influence him to a dishonest action—Beside, friend Leonard, to let you into a secret, I neither like your scheme, nor wish to forward it. After a long absence, I have had the happiness to meet my father, and when I behold in him what a glow of youth an honest heart infuses into an aged face, I am determined to abandon my roguery, and try to make the rosy honours of honesty, hereditary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You mean, then, to defeat my purposes?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="54" facs="57"/>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>I certainly mean not to aid them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>But am I to expect your opposition?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>I hope, Leonard, your own reflections will render that needless. Could you have fairly gained the girl's affections, I should have rejoiced at your success, and thought the society of an amiable woman the likeliest school for forming an honest man; but force—to use force against a lovely, helpless female, none but a devil could inspire the thought, and none but devils could be found to execute it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Bravo! one might judge by your energy that you were a new-made proselyte. Apostates are always the maddest enthusiasts—But, fool! do you think I am to be preached out of my intentions?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>And do you think I am to be bullied out of mine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, take your course, but be cautious that you do not thwart me—Dare not to breathe a word of my designs, unless your devotion to your new tenets is warm enough to make you welcome a prison in their defence. Mark me, a prison. You may remember there are certain bonds of yours in my possession that give me as entire a power over your person, as tho' you were my purchased slave. Remember this, and act accordingly. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>How my blood boils at the villain! too true he has me in his power; but I'll keep him in view—I'll watch his motions. I've deserved a prison before now, and have escaped it; well, then, if I am brought to one at last for a good deed, all's square again, and I begin the world a fresh man.</p>

<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Your gloom, I find, has taken the general course, and led you to misanthropy. When men have been unfortunate they generally grow unjust.</p>

<p>Yes; and for that there is some excuse—But when men are unjust and fortunate too, what black souls they must have.</p>

<p>Very true; but have you had experience of such?</p>

<p>Yes—by play, not knavery.</p>

His malice then, must have a check—he shall instantly be taken care of. I have the power to secure <hi>him.</hi> The old rustic, whom he calls his father, I have been forced to entrap somewhat illegally; but he will be safe till my scheme is executed, and then the fellow that I have bribed to swear a debt against him, may, by flight, secure himself from the vengeance of the violated law. All is well arranged, and this very night shall put me securely in possession of my Eastern beauty, and her Eastern riches. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>

<p>No, sir: but with your aid the fortune may be ours without the incumbrance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>The fortune ours—Eh, how?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Had Cleveland died unmarried you were his heir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="70" facs="73"/>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Yes—what of that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Are we sure he did not die unmarried?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>We should be pretty sure, I think, when he has left a wife and child behind to convince us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Is she his wife? Can she prove herself such?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Eh!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>By his own account the marriage was a private one, a private marriage in the East-Indies! Reflect first on the probability of its being no marriage, and next consider the difficulty of proving it, if it were one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, very true. But you surely do not doubt the marriage therefore to claim a property, because, perhaps, legal proof can't be obtained—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Is, you think, not strictly within the pale of moral rectitude.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>I can't say but I am of that opinion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Oh, sir, despise all abstract refinement, and be assured that you fulfil every moral obligation when your conduct is sanctioned by the laws of your country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>There is something in that; but yet justice, you know, can only be guided by appearances, and one's conscience will not always acquiesce—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>My dear sir, when your conscience opposes a legal decree, you should consider it as acting contumaciously, and that it ought to be silenced for contempt of the court.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>If I could be satisfied that they were really not married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>There is strong presumption. Would Cleveland's father, think you, have endeavoured to dissolve the sacred ties of marriage? Have insisted
<pb n="71" facs="74"/>
on his son's abruptly dismissing—a wife? No, no, sir—depend on it, the father, anxious for his son's respectability, demanded only his parting with a favourite mistress.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Very likely—very likely—I always said you had the way of placing things in a right point of view, Oh, my scruples are gone—should I be robbed of my right by a mistress, and a—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Certainly not, sir. Now then you are convinced of the rectitude of your cause, let me urge a strong motive for proceeding with vigour. I have this morning received the unwelcome tidings of the failure of a speculation in which I had embarked the entire amount of my own fortune, so that I am now compelled to become a burthen to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>O lord, lord, dear me, how sorry I am to hear it; for, my dear boy, to let you into the true state of my affairs—Lady Jemima's cursed fashionable stile of living has made such a miserable hole in my property, that it is not clear to me, but I may die in a jail.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You amaze me, sir—then, this is our only resource, and at all hazards we must accomplish it.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter a <hi>Servant</hi></stage>
<sp>

<p>Mr. Oakworth desires to see both you and my young master directly, sir.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gent.</speaker>
<p>Sir, give me leave to ask, that is, if there be no offence in the question, are the ladies you mention under any pecuniary embarrassment? for it would be a sad thing to have ladies liable to the rudeness of this unfeeling fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>No, sir, thank heaven! Even my poor pocket could satisfy his paltry demands. No, no,—tho' they are unfortunate, they are not in the power of such a pitiful scoundrel as that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gent.</speaker>
<p>I am glad of it; but still you say they are unfortunate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Yes; misery be the lot of the villians who made them so!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gent.</speaker>
<p>Who are those villians.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Their own relations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gent.</speaker>
<p>Heav'ns, what depravity! But can't this villiany be in any way redressed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Only one way, if at all; and there the remedy would be as bad as the disease.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gent.</speaker>
<p>What is the remedy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Going to law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gent.</speaker>
<p>If law can give the remedy, redress is certain; in this country the way to justice is not through blind mazes and crooked paths—No, 'tis a public road, open to all, obvious to all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>That is very true; but like other public
<pb n="77" facs="80"/>
roads, you would get on a very little way, without money to pay the tolls.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gent.</speaker>
<p>The warm interest you take in the cause of your friends convinces me that they are worthy of it. I have a fortune, an ample fortune, and I can no way employ it so satisfactorily as in rescuing the virtuous from the machinations of villainy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Sir, sir, let me rightly understand you. I beg your pardon; but do you indeed mean to employ your fortune to relieve the distress of strangers, utter strangers to you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gent.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, or how should I relieve distress at all; for all that belong to me, thank heaven, are above the power of fortune's malice.</p>

<p>Nay, nay, good old man, I were blest enough for all that I can do, in seeing how happy I have made you. But a widow—an orphan, say you? Those are sacred names. The husband gone, who is protector to the widow!—Heaven—The parent lost, who is the orphan's father? Heaven. The man then, who will not assert their rights, is not uncharitable only; for he is impious.—Good man, why do you tremble thus?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>I am old—I feel now, I am an old man; and tho' my nerves, I think, would bear me stoutly up, under adversity, yet, somehow this sudden turn of good fortune has <hi>shook</hi> me, has <hi>shook</hi> me a good deal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Compose yourself—then tell the ladies that I shall see them very soon; for I now must go.</p>

<p>My business hence is nothing trivial; and only a case of misfortune could have detained me

but ound that an attempt to land would whelm us in the raging surf—thus were we compelled to trust our little skiff to the wide ocean, and for many hours were driven at random by its fury—At length we gained the land, but far from the coast on which we left our wreck.</p>

<p>This woman has the power of influencing persons very much in her favour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>Innocence always has that power.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Innocence! Sir, sir, you are duped, deceived.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>How, sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Nay, sir, if you fly off in this way, you are not the man of sense I take you for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, go on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You are led to believe this lady to have been Mr. Cleveland's wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="82" facs="85"/>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir; I am—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Grossly imposed on. We have the most convincing reasons to believe the contrary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Sir, sir, what do you think of us? Should we be so lost to the common feelings of human nature as to proceed as we have done, but upon just ground?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I assure you, sir, before I consented, Leonard thoroughly convinced me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>He did?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and you shall be convinced. Oh, sir, let me appeal to your respectability. You are a man who must, I am certain, rank high in the world's estimation. How would that be injured by your present interference! How would the world despise, abhor the man who could support the claims of mere pretenders against a rightful heir!</p>
<stage><hi>(pointing to</hi> Old Visorly.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>How the world will despise, will abhor such a wretch, will very soon be known.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You, perhaps, are not aware that she has no proofs of her marriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>Proofs may be found.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>In India, you think. Will you go thither for them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>I have been.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>I have been.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You knew Cleveland, perhaps?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Do you know, then, of his marriage?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>I was present at it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You surprize me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>Will this satisfy you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>A witness may be suborned. The law
<pb n="83" facs="86"/>
will scarcely be content with one person's testimony.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>With mine it clearly will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You may be mistaken, sir. It will be rash to risk it. I will make an offer, a handsome offer—We will resign our claim to half the fortune, manage the business with the ladies as you please, you may depend on our secresy. We tender to <hi>you,</hi> mind, to <hi>yourself</hi> half the fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>It is a handsome offer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Very indeed! may be you think a third would be enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>No, no, far from it; for though the bribe sounds handsomely, it would be want of policy in me to take it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>For this plain reason, that, tho' I admit these ladies to be Cleveland's wife and daughter, still Cleveland's fortune is the right of—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Whom?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>Me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You! by what title?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>The clearest in the world—founded on the simple principle, that while a man can prove himself alive, his heirs are not allowed to take possession of his property.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Alive!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>Why, gentlemen, you are very hard to be convinced. Surely you should admit a man alive, when he is able himself to tell you so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Confusion!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>And, how do you now feel yourselves, my very worthy cousins? <stage>(Goes to the door.)</stage> Come, come in, and thank your kinsmen for all their kindness.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Leonard, Leonard, did I ever think you would have brought me into such disgrace!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>Sensible rebuke of age to youth! You should have led your son into the path of honesty, not been seduced by him into the road of villainy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Vis.</speaker>
<p>I'll go home, and if I continue in my present mind, I think it very likely I shall hang myself before to-morrow morning. Oh Leonard, Leonard! <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>With your company, sir, <stage>(to Leonard.)</stage> I cannot dispense, till I receive assurance that my property remitted to you is vested as I directed.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> DROOPLY, CAROLINE, HENRY, <hi>and</hi> OAKWORTH.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>My worthy brother, give me joy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Your brother!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Even so, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>You are well paired. I wish you all the happiness that mutual poverty can give you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Poverty! nay, we need not starve. My estate is surely sufficient to prevent that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Your estate! You must first persuade me to resign the writings of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>Thank you, dear brother; but you happen to forget you have already done that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>I! how—when?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>By your direction I brought the box to town with me, which you said, contained the writings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Yes,—ay—that box—hey! let me see it—I have got the key of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>The key, my dear fellow! Do you think
<pb n="85" facs="88"/>
I do things so cursed mechanically as to want keys? A man just come into possession of an estate, and not break open the box that contained his claim to it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>What, broke open!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>Yes, with a kitchen poker. Lord, how alarmed you are! Yes, I broke it open, and found I had killed two birds with one stone; for, instead of only getting the writings of one estate, I found the writings of two—This lady's and my own.</p>
</sp>
<stage>A person enters and converses apart with <hi>CLEVELAND,</hi> and then Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Curses fall on me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dro.</speaker>
<p>That they will, fast enough never fear. What a shrewd guesser you must be! You had the wisdom to foresee, that some time or other, there would be a junction of the properties, and you therefore commodiously packed up the writings together. Ah, you are a considerate fellow!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<stage>to Leonard.</stage>
<p>Sir, we need your presence here no longer. My property I find is vested as I appointed. Now, sir, depart, loaded not with my reproaches, not with my malediction; for the whole world's contempt, and the heaviest curses of the injured would add but a feather's weight to the mountain of remorse which conscious guilt will heap upon thy wretched bosom. When I reflect on the severity of suffering conscience can inflict, I could almost forget my injuries, and pity thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>To palliate my guilt I do not seek—yet, in justice, let me declare, the erroneous judgment of the world made me a villian. I beheld the eye of observance and respect ever directed to the wealthy; were he fool or knave, no matter.
<pb n="86" facs="89"/>
While all that is truly amiable or great in genius or in virtue, when linked with poverty, was heeded with the stare of disavowal, or the scowl of contempt. To be a golden idol for the world's worship was my aim. I have lost my fortune, character, and happiness in the attempt, and now must meet in penury mankind's abhorrence, and feel too, I deserve it. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Clev.</speaker>
<p><stage>(to Caroline.)</stage> I grieve to think how much you must be afflicted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Car.</speaker>
<p>I am indeed; for with all his unworthiness, I cannot forget he is my brother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>Such remembrance honours you; for never should the principles of justice absorb the feelings of nature.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SHARPSET, <hi>and</hi> GANGICA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my good friend, you at liberty!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir, I found bail.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>I am very glad to see you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs Clev.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I shall ever feel myself your debtor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>I know a way to repay him, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Clev.</speaker>
<p>How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>By making him rightful possessor of the treasure he holds in his hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Gangica, do you consent to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gan.</speaker>
<p>I do all as you please, ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>I am sure it will please me that you make yourself happy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Now I have performed my promise, you must renew my acquaintance with your father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>You and my father, sir, have never been asunder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Hey! What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="87" facs="90"/>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>To restore you a truant son, sir, who, till he had atoned as far as lay in his power for his former errors, could not hope to be acknowledged by such a father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>What, my own boy turned out an honest man?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shar.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir; and who, now knowing the precious value of that first of titles, will never forfeit it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oakw.</speaker>
<p>Now, then, I can say I am completely happy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Clev.</speaker>
<p>Ever, ever may you remain so!—You will; for benevolence like yours makes the human heart a heaven.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clev.</speaker>
<p>The gratitude I owe to all who have befriended these dear objects of my love, I hope to shew by something more than words. What a prospect of happiness opens to our view! Blest with friends, proved such in the trying moments of affliction—with fortune to command profusely every luxury, and I trust, with minds to employ it only in pursuit of one—the luxury of doing good.</p>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>WRITTEN BY JOHN TAYLOR, ESQ. AND SPOKEN BY MRS. POPE.</byline>
<lg>
<l>WELL, tho' our Bard has try'd his utmost art</l>
<l>To shew how riches will pollute the heart,</l>
<l>No doubt his labour has been all in vain,</l>
<l>And poverty will ne'er one convert gain.</l>
<l>How could the man attempt a task so bold!</l>
<l>But what, forsooth, can authors know of gold?</l>
<l>An ore that rarely darts on them a beam,</l>
<l>Unless, perchance, in hope's delusive dream;</l>
<l>Hope, that misleads them thro' life's weary way,</l>
<l>And scarcely leaves at last the barren bay.</l>
<l>What, wean the human heart from love of pelf!</l>
<l>A toil, too hard for Hercules himself!</l>
<l>Nay, that great hero, as we learn in story,</l>
<l>Strove for a little gain, as well as glory,</l>
<l>Else why attack the dreadful scaly brute,</l>
<l>If not to grasp the rich Hesperian fruit?</l>
<l>Hence, av'rice is a passion not so odd,</l>
<l>Since, as we find, it urg'd a demi-god.</l>
<l>'Twas also said of yore the female tribe,</l>
<l>Are frail as men when tempted by a bribe,</l>
<l>And mighty Jove, with all his boasted pow'r</l>
<l>Was forc'd to woo amid a golden show'r.</l>
<l>Oh! wond'rous charm of all-persuasive gold,</l>
<l>That fires the timid, and subdues the bold.</l>
<l>Gold, that can give the upstart blockhead fame,</l>
<l>And make a fawning world his wit proclaim;</l>
<l><pb facs="92"/>
That lends deformity resistless grace,</l>
<l>O'erthrows the mighty, and exalts the base;</l>
<l>Great substitute for learning, genius, worth,</l>
<l>Despotic sovereign of adoring earth!</l>
<l>But let me check the rash injurious thought,</l>
<l>For, in this court, no verdict can be bought.</l>
<l>Here merit safely may assert her plea,</l>
<l>While candour regulates the mild decree;</l>
<l>And by that candour one who oft has try'd</l>
<l>Its gen'rous force, his fate must now abide,</l>
<l>In hopes one error more will pardon find,</l>
<l>Since to his others you've so long been kind.</l>

<p>To the concurrent testimonies of all the periodical publications of taste and literature already adduced, we shall only add, from the European Magazine, that the writer of their Review, after delaying his account of the Work, in order to ascertain its authenticity, in the number for November last, says: "On the most indisputable testimony, and the highest authority, the writer has it now in his power to declare that these volumes, under the modest and limited title of The Life of the late Empress of Russia, comprise a faithful and impartial History of the Political Transactions and Publick Affairs of the Northern Courts of Europe during the Reign of Catharine II.; together with a regular narration of the progressive aggrandisement, civilization, and general improvement, of the Russian Empire, from the time of Peter the Great to that of the Death of the late Empress in 1796."</p>
<p n="2">2. ANECDOTES of LORD CHATHAM's LIFE. The Sixth Edition. In Three Volumes, 8vo. Price 18s. Boards.</p>
<quote>The author has made a valuable collection of Anecdotes, especially of the late and most conspicuous part of Lord Chatham's Life; and of other matters connected with it. He says he is not conscious of having advanced one falsehood: we give credit to his declacation, having found no cause to doubt it.</quote>
