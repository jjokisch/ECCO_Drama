<stage>Enter <hi>MERLIN</hi> and <hi>URGANDA.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>BUT hear me, Merlin, I beseech you, hear me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<p>Hear you! I have heard you—for years have heard your vows, your protestations—Have you not allur'd my affections by every female art? and when I thought that my unalterable passion was to be rewarded for its constancy—What have you done?—Why, like mere mortal woman, in the true spirit of frailty, have given up me and my pes—for what?—a boy, an ideot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Ev'n this I can bear from Merlin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<p>You have injur'd me, and must bear more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>I'll repair that injury.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<p>Then send back you fav'rite Cymon to his disconsolate friends.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>How can you imagine that such a poor ignorant object as Cymon is can have any charms for me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<p>Ignorance, no more than profligacy, is excluded from female favour; the success of rakes and fools, is a sufficient warning to us, could we be wise enough to take it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>You mistake me, Merlin; pity for Cymon's state of mind, and friendship for his father, have induced me to endeavour at his cure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<p>False, prevaricating Urganda! Love was your inducement. Have you not stolen the prince from his royal father, and detained him here by your power while a hundred knights are in search after him?—Does not every thing about you prove the consequence of your want of honour and faith to me? Were you not plac'd on this happy spot of Arcadia, to be the guardian of its peace and innocence? and have not the Arcadians liv'd for ages the envy of less happy, because less virtuous people?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Let me beseech you, Merlin, spare my shame.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<p>And are they not at last, by your example, sunk from their state of happiness and tranquillity to that of care, vice, and folly! Their once happy lives are now imbitter'd with envy, passion, vanity, selfishness, and inconstancy;—and who are they to curse for this change? Urganda, the lost Urgande.</p>

<p>Let us talk calmly of this matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<p>I'll converse with you no more—because I I will be no more deceiv'd: I cannot hate you, tho' I shun you—Yet, in my misery, I have this consolation, that the pangs of my jealousy are at least equall'd by the torments of your fruitless passion.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you, Madam, when he is out of hearing—He means mischief, and terrible mischiet too; no less, I believe, than ravishing you, and cutting my tongue out—I wish we were out of his clutches.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Don't fear, Fatima.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>I can't help it, he has great power, and is mischievously angry.</p>

<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Here is your protection <stage>(shewing her wand.)</stage> My power is at least equal to his— <stage>(muses)</stage> <hi>And <hi>Cymon's</hi> cure shall be <hi>Urganda's</hi> wound!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>Don't trouble your head with these odd ends of verses, which were spoke in a passion; or, perhaps, for the rhyme's sake.—Think a little to clear us from this old mischief-making conjurer—What will you do, madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>What can I do, Fatima?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>You might very easily settle matters with him, if you cou'd as easily settle 'em with yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Tell me how?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>Marry Merlin, and send away the young sellow. <stage>(Urganda shakes her head.)</stage> I thought so—we are all alike, and that folly of ours in preferring two-and-twenty to two-and-forty, runs thro' the whole sex of us—but, before matters grow worse, give me leave to reason a little with you, madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>I am in love, Fatima, <stage>(sighing)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>And poor reason may stay at home—me exactly!—Ay, ay, we are all alike—but with this difference, madam—your passion is surely a strange one—you have stolen away this young man; who, bating his youth and figure, has not one single circumstance to create affection about him. He is half an idiot, madam, which is no great compliment to your wisdom, your beauty, or your power.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>I despise them all—for they can neither relieve my passion, or create one where I would have them.</p>

<l>What is knowledge, and beauty, and power,</l>
<l>Or what is my magical art?</l>
<l>Can I for a day, for an hour,</l>
<l>Have beauty to make the youth kind,</l>
<l>Have pow'r o'er his mind,</l>
<l>Or knowledge to warm his cold heart:</l>
<l>O! no—a weak boy all my magic disarms,</l>
<l>And I sigh all the day with my pow'r and my charms.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>Sigh all the day!—More shame for you, madam—Cymon is incapable of being touch'd with any thing; nothing gives him pleasure, but twirling his cap, and hunting butterflies—he'll make a sad lover indeed, madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>I can wait with patience for the recovery of his understanding; it begins to dawn already.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>Where pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>In his eyes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>Eyes!—Ha, ha, ha!—Love has none, madam—the heart only sees, on these occasions—Cymon was born a fool—and his eyes will never look as you would have them, take my word for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Don't make me despair, Fatima.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>Don't lose your time then; 'tis the business of beauty to make fools, and not cure 'em—Even I poor I, could have made twenty fools of wife men, in half the time that you have been endeavouring to make your fool sensible—O! 'tis a sad way of spending one's time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Hold your tongue, Fatima—my passion is too serious to be jested with.</p>
</sp>

<p>Far gone indeed, madam—and yonder goes the precious object of it.</p>

<p>He seems melancholy: what's the matter with him?</p>

<p>He's a fool, or he might make himself very merry among us—I'll leave you to make the most of him.—</p>

<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Stay, Fatima—and help me to divert him.</p>

<head>ACT II.</head>
<div2 type="scene">
<head>SCENE, <stage>A Rural Prospect.</stage></head>
<stage>Enter two Shepherdesses.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<p>WHAT to be left and forsaken! and see the false fellow make the same vows to another, almost before my face! I can't bear it, and I won't!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d Shep.</speaker>
<p>Why, look ye, Sister, I am as little inclin'd to bear these things as yourself; and if my swain had been faithless too, I should have been vex'd at it, to be sure; but how can you help yourself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<p>I have not thought of that; I only feel I can't bear it; and as to the <hi>won't,</hi> I must trust in a little mischief of my own to bring it about.—O, that I had the power of our enchantress yonder! I wou'd play the devil with them all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d. Shep.</speaker>
<p>And yet folks say, she has no power in love-matters; you know, notwithstanding her charms, and her spirits, she is in love with a fool, and has not wit enough to make him return it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="14"/>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<p>No matter for that; if I could not make folks love me, I would make them miserable and that's the next pleasure to it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d Shep.</speaker>
<p>And yet, to do justice to to her who makes all this disturbance among you, she does not in the least encourage the Shepherds, and she can't help their falling in love with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<p>May be so, nor can I help hating and detesting her, because they do fall in love with her.—Sylvia's good qualities cannot excuse her to me; my quarrel to her is, that all the young fellows follow her, not because she does not follow the young fellows.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d Shep.</speaker>
<p>Well, but really now, sister, 'tis a little hard, that a girl, who has beauty to get lovers, or merit enough to keep 'em, should be hated for her good qualities. <stage>(Affectedly.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<p>Marry come up, my insulting sister; because you think your shepherd constant, you have no feeling for the false-heartedness of mine.—But don't be too vain with your success; my Dorilas is made of the same stuff as your Damon; and I can't for the life of me see that you have any particular security for your fool, more than I had for mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d Shep.</speaker>
<p>Why are you so angry, my dear sister?—I am not Sylvia, and to oblige you, I will abuse her wherever I go, and whenever you please; I think she is a most provoking creature, and I wish she was out of the country with all my soul.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<p>And so she ought to be. She has no business here with her good qualities. Nobody knows who she is, or whence she came.—She was left here with old Dorcas, but how, or by whom, or for what, except to make mischief among us, I know not—There is some mystery about her, and I'll find it out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d Shep.</speaker>
<p>But will your quarrelling with her bring back your sweetheart?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="17" facs="15"/>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<p>No matter for that—when the heart is over-loaded, any vent is a relief to it; and that of the tongue is always the readiest and most natural—So if you wont't help me to find her, you may stay where you will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Linco,</speaker>
<stage>singing without.</stage>
<lg type="song">
<l>Care flies from the lad that is merry.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d Shep.</speaker>
<p>Here comes the merry Linco, who never knew care, or felt forrow.—If you can bear his laughing at your griefs, or singing away his own, you may get some information from him.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Linco</hi> singing.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>What, my girls of ten thousand! I was this moment defying love and all his mischief, and you are sent in the nick by him, to try my courage; but I'm above temptation, or below it—I duck down, and all his arrows fly over me.</p>
<lg type="song">

<l>Care flies from the lad that is merry,</l>
<l>Whose heart is as sound</l>
<l>And cheeks are as round,</l>
<l>As round, and as red as a cherry.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<p>What are you always thus?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>Ay, or Heav'n help me! What would you have me to do as you do—walking with your arms across, thus—heighho'ing by the brook side among the willows. Oh! fye for shame, lasses! young and handsome, and sighing after one fellow a-piece, when you should have a hundred in a drove, following you like—like—you shall have the simile another time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d Shep.</speaker>
<p>No; prithee, Linco, give it us now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="18" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>You shall have it—or, what's better, I'll tell you what you are <hi>not</hi> like—you are not like our shepherdess Sylvia—she's so cold, and so coy, that she flies from her lovers, but is never without a score of them; you are always running after the fellows, and yet are always alone; a very great difference, let me tell you—frost and fire, that's all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d Shep.</speaker>
<p>Don't imagine, that I am in the pining condition my poor sister is—I am as happy as she is miserable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>Good lack, I'm sorry for't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d Shep.</speaker>
<p>What, sorry that I am happy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>Oh! no, prodigious glad.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<p>That I am miserable?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>No, no:—prodigious sorry for that—and prodigious glad of the other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<p>Be my friend, Linco; aud I'll confess my folly to you.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>Don't trouble yourself—'tis plain enough to be seen—but I'll give you a receipt for it without fee or reward—There's friendship for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<p>Prithee, be serious a little.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>No; Heav'n forbid! If I am serious, 'tis all over with me—I should soon change my roses for your lilies.</p>
</sp>

<p>I'll tear Sylvia's eyes out.</p>

<div2 type="scene">
<head>SCENE <stage>before <hi>Urganda's</hi> Palace.</stage></head>
<stage>Enter <hi>Urganda</hi> and <hi>Fatima.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>IS he not returned yet, Fatima?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>He has no feelings but those of hunger; when that pinches him, he'll return to be fed, like other animals.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Fatima, his insensibility astonishes and distracts me.—I have exhausted all my arts to overcome it; I have run all dangers to make an impression upon him; and, instead of finding my passion in the least abated by his ingratitude, I am only a greater slave to my weakness, and more incapable of relief.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>Why then I may as well hold my tongue—but before I would waste all the prime of my womanhood in playing such a losing game, I would—but I see you don't mind me, madam, and therefore I'll say no more—I know the consequence, and must submit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>What can I do in my situation?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>What you ought to do—and you belye your beauty and understanding by not doing it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Explain yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>To secure my tongue, and your honour, (for Merlin will have you by hook or by crook.) Marry him directly—it will prevent mischief at least—so much for prudence.—During your honeymoon, I will hide the young gentleman, and if he has any tinder in him kindle him up for you. If your husband should be tired of you, as ten to one he will, I'll step in his way, he may be glad of the
<pb n="27" facs="25"/>
change, and in return, I'll restore young Simplicity to you.—That's what I call a fashionable scheme.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>I can't bear trifling at this time—you'll make me angry with you.—But see where Cymon approaches—he seems transported—Look, look, Fatima! He is kissing and embracing my nosegay—it has had the desired effect, and I am happy—we'll be invisible, that I may observe his transports.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Urganda</hi> waves her wand, and retires with <hi>Fatima.</hi></stage>
<stage>Enter <hi>Cymon</hi> hugging a nosegay.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<p>Oh my dear, sweet, charming nosegay!—To see thee, to smell thee, and to taste thee, <stage>(Kisses it)</stage> will make Urganda and her garden delightful to me. <stage>(Kisses it.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>What does he say?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Hush, hush!—all transport, and about me; What a change is this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<p>With this I can want for nothing.—I possess every thing with this.—My mind and heart are expanded: I feel—I know not what—Every thought that delights, and every passion that transports, gather, like so many bees, about this treasure of sweetness—Oh, the dear, dear nosegay, and the dear, dear giver of it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>The dear, dear giver.—Mind that, Fatima! What heavenly eloquence! Here's a change of heart and mind—heigho!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>I'm all amazement!—in a dream!—but is that your nosegay?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Mine! How can you doubt it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fat.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I'm near-sighted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<p>She has not a beauty that is not brought to mind by these flowers.—This the colour of her hair—this of her skin—this of her cheeks—this of her eyes—this of her lips—sweet, sweet—and those rose buds—O! I shall go out of my wits with pleasure!</p>

<p>'Tis pity to lose 'em the moment you have found 'em.—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>O Fatima! I never was proud of my power or vain of my beauty, till this transporting moment!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<p>Where shall I put it? Where shall I conceal it from every body.—I'll keep it in my bosom, next my heart, all the day; and at night, I will put it upon my pillow, and talk to it—and sigh to it—and swear to it, and sleep by it—and kiss it for ever and ever.</p>

<p>What! give a thing, and take it away again?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>I would not take it away for the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<p>Nor would I give it you, for a hundred worlds.</p>

<p>See it by all means, madam—I have my reasons. <stage>(aside to <hi>Urganda.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>I must see it, Cymon, and therefore no delay—you cannot have the love you seem'd to have but now, and refuse me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<p>O but I can, and for that reason.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urg.</speaker>
<p>Don't provoke me—I will see it, or shut you up for ever.</p>

your own, and you had a right to give it away, or throw it away.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, but I did not—I only gave it for this—which as it is so much finer and sweeter, I thought would not vex you.</p>

<p>Don't mind her impertinence, Cymon—I give you leave to follow your own inclinations.—I brought you hither for your pleasure, indulge yourself in every thing you like—and be as happy as following your desires can make you.</p>

<p>We are commanded by our governor, who has orders from Urganda, to bring Cymon and Sylvia before her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>And you are fond of this employment are you? fye, for shame—I know more than you think I know.—You were each of you (good souls!) betroth'd to two shepherdesses—but Silvia comes in the nick, and away go vows, promises, and protestations—she loving Cymon, and despising you—and you.—You (hating one another) join cordially to distress them for loving one another—fye, for shame, shepherds!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dam.</speaker>
<p>What will the governor say to this? This is fine treatment of your betters.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>If my betters are no better than they should be, 'tis their fault, and not mine—Urganda, Dorus, and you, not being able to reach the grapes, won't let any body else taste them—fye, for shame, shepherds!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dam.</speaker>
<p>We have no time to lose—we must raise the shepherds, and hunt after these young sinners; and you, Mr. Deputy, for all your airs, must make one in the chase.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>Before I would follow unlawful game to please a hot-liver'd enchantress, an old itching governor, and two such jealous pated noodles as yourselves, I would thrust my pipe thro' my tabor, chuck it into the river, and myself after it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dam.</speaker>
<p>Here comes the governor; now we shall hear what you will say to him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lin.</speaker>
<p>Just what I have said to you; an honest laughing fellow, like myself, don't mind a governor, though I should raise his spleen, and lose my place into the bargain—there are not many deputies in Arcadia of the same mind.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE, for New Years Day.</head>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. <hi>KING.</hi></stage>
<lg>
<l>I Come obedient at my brethrens call,</l>
<l>From top to bottom, to salute you all;</l>
<l>Warmly to wish, before our piece you view,</l>
<l>A happy year—to you—you—you—and you!<stage>Boxes—Pit—1 Gall.—2 Gall.</stage></l>
<l>From you the play'rs enjoy, and feel it here,</l>
<l>The <hi>merry Christmas,</hi> and the <hi>happy year.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>There is a good old saying—pray attend it;</l>
<l>As you begin the year, you'll surely end it;</l>
<l>Should any one this night incline to evil,</l>
<l>He'll play for twelve long months, the very devil!</l>
<l>Should any married dame exert her tongue.</l>
<l>She'll sing, the <hi>Zodiac</hi> round, the same sweet song:</l>
<l>And should the husband join <hi>his</hi> music too,</l>
<l>Why then 'tis <hi>cat</hi> and <hi>dog</hi> the whole year thro'.</l>
<l>Ye sons of <hi>law</hi> and <hi>physic,</hi> for your ease,</l>
<l>Besure, this day, you never take your fees:</l>
<l>Can't you refuse?—then the disease grows strong,</l>
<l>You'll have two itching palms—Lord knows how long!</l>
<l>Writers of news, by this strange fate are bound,</l>
<l>They fib to day, and fib the whole year round.</l>
<l>You wits assembled here, both great and small,</l>
<l>Set not this night afloat—your critic gall;</l>
<l>If you should snarl, and not incline to laughter,</l>
<l>What sweet companions for a twelvemonth after!</l>
<l>You must he muzzled for this night at least;</l>
<l>Our author has a right this day to feast.</l>
<l>He has not touch'd one bit as yet.—Remember</l>
<l>'Tis a long <hi>fast</hi>—from now to next December.</l>
<l>'Tis <hi>holiday!</hi> you are <hi>our patrons</hi> now; <stage>(to the upper gallery,</stage></l>
<l>If you but grin, the critics wont <hi>bow, wow.</hi></l>
<l>As for the plot, wit, humour, language—I</l>
<l>Beg you such trisles kindly to pass by;</l>
<l>The most essential part, which something means,</l>
<l>As dresses, dances, sinkings, flyings, scenes!—</l>
<l>They'll make you stare! nay, there is such a thing</l>
<l>Will make you stare!—still more▪—for I must sing:</l>
<l>And should your taste, and ears, be over nice,</l>
<l>Alas; you'll spoil my finging in a trice.</l>
<l>If you should <hi>growl,</hi> my notes will alter soon,</l>
<l>I can't be <hi>in</hi>—if you are <hi>out</hi> of tune!</l>
<l>Permit my fears your favour to bespeak,</l>
<l>My part's a strong one, and <hi>poor I but weak.</hi><stage>(alluding to his late accident.</stage></l>
<l>If you but smile, I'm firm, if frown, I stumble—</l>
<l>Scarce well of <hi>one,</hi> spare me a <hi>second</hi> tumble.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE,</head>
<byline>Written by <hi>GEORGE KEATE,</hi> <abbr>Esq</abbr></byline>
<stage>Spoken by Mrs. ABINGTON.</stage>
<stage>(Enter peeping in at the stage-door.)</stage>
<lg>
<l>IS the stage clear?—bless me!—I've such a dread!</l>
<l>It seems enchanted ground, where'er I tread! <stage>(Coming forward.</stage></l>
<l>What noise was that!—hush!—'twas a false alarm.—</l>
<l>I'm sure there's no one here will do me harm.</l>
<l>Amongst you can't be found a single knight,</l>
<l>Who would not do an injur'd damsel right.—</l>
<l>Well—heav'n be prais'd, I'm out of magic reach,</l>
<l>And have once more regain'd the pow'r of speech:</l>
<l>Aye, and I'll use it—for it must appear,</l>
<l>That my poor tongue is greatly in arrear.—</l>
<l>There's not a female here but shar'd my woe,</l>
<l>Ty'd down to YES, or still more hateful NO,</l>
<l>No is expressive—but I must confess,</l>
<l>If rightly question'd, I'd use only YES.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>In MERLIN's walk this broken wand I found, <stage>(Shewing a broken wand.</stage></l>
<l>Which to <hi>two words</hi> my speaking organs bound.</l>
<l>Suppose upon the town I try his spell—</l>
<l>Ladies, don't stir—You use your tongues too well!—</l>
<l>How tranquil ev'ry place, when, by my skill,</l>
<l>FOLLY is mute, and even SLANDER still!</l>
<l>Old gossips speechless—<hi>bloods</hi> would breed no riot,</l>
<l>And all the tongues at JONATHAN's lie quiet!</l>
<l>Each <hi>grave profession</hi> must new bush the wig;</l>
<l>Nothing to say, 'twere needful they look big!</l>
<l>The <hi>reverend doctor</hi> might the change endure,</l>
<l>He would sit still, and have his <hi>sine cure!</hi></l>
<l>Nor could <hi>great folks</hi> much hardship undergo;</l>
<l>They do their business with an AYE or NO!—</l>
<l>But, come, I only jok'd—dismiss your fear;</l>
<l>Tho' I've the pow'r, I will not use it here.</l>
<l>I'll only keep my magic, as a guard,</l>
<l>To awe each critic, who attacks our bard.</l>
<l>I see some malecontents their singers biting,</l>
<l>Snarling, " The ancients never knew such writing—</l>
<l>" The drama's lost!—the managers exhaust us</l>
<l>" With <hi>opera's, monkies, mab</hi> and <hi>Dr. Faustus.</hi>"</l>
<l>Dread Sirs, a word!—the public taste is fickle;</l>
<l>All palates in their turn we strive to tickle;</l>
<l>Our cat'rers <hi>vary,</hi> and you'll own at least,</l>
<l>It is <hi>variety</hi> that makes the feast.</l>
<l>If this fair circle smile—and the <hi>gods</hi> thunder,</l>
<l>I with this wand will heep the critics under.</l>
