<head>PROLOGUE,</head>
<byline>By Mr. <hi>POPE.</hi></byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. <hi>Wilks.</hi></byline>
<lg>
<l>TO wake the Soul by tender Strokes of Art,</l>
<l>To raise the Genius, and to mend the Heart,</l>
<l>To make Mankind in conscious Virtue bold,</l>
<l>Live o'er each Scene, and Be what they behold:</l>
<l>For this the Tragic-Muse first trod the Stage,</l>
<l>Commanding Tears to stream thro' every Age;</l>
<l>Tyrants no more their Savage Nature kept,</l>
<l>And Foes to Virtue wonder'd how they wept.</l>
<l>Our Author shuns by vulgar Springs to move</l>
<l>The Hero's Glory, or the Virgin's Love;</l>
<l>In pitying Love we but our Weakness show,</l>
<l>And wild Ambition well deserves its Woe.</l>
<l>Here Tears shall slow from a more gen'rous Cause,</l>
<l>Such Tears as Patriots shed for dying Laws:</l>
<l><pb facs="4"/>
He bids your Breasts with Ancient Ardor rise,</l>
<l>And calls forth <hi>Roman</hi> Drops from <hi>British</hi> Eyes.</l>
<l>Virtue confess'd in human Shape he draws,</l>
<l>What <hi>Plato</hi> Thought, and God-like <hi>Cato</hi> Was:</l>
<l>No common Object to your Sight displays,</l>
<l>But what with Pleasure Heav'n it self surveys;</l>
<l>A brave Man struggling in the Storms of Fate,</l>
<l>And greatly falling with a falling State!</l>
<l>While <hi>Cato</hi> gives his little Senate Laws,</l>
<l>What Bosom beats not in his Country's Cause?</l>
<l>Who sees him act, but envies ev'ry Deed?</l>
<l>Who hears him groan, and does not wish to bleed?</l>
<l>Ev'n when proud <hi>Caesar</hi> 'midst triumphal Cars,</l>
<l>The Spoils of Nations, and the Pomp of Wars,</l>
<l>Ignobly Vain, and impotently Great,</l>
<l>Show'd <hi>Rome</hi> her <hi>Cato</hi>'s Figure drawn in State;</l>
<l>As her dead Father's rev'rend Image past,</l>
<l>The Pomp was darken'd, and the Day o'ercast,</l>
<l>The Triumph ceas'd—Tears gush'd from ev'ry Eye;</l>
<l>The World's great Victor past unheeded by;</l>
<l>Her Last good Man dejected <hi>Rome</hi> ador'd,</l>
<l>And honour'd <hi>Caesar</hi>'s less than <hi>Cato</hi>'s Sword.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l><hi>Britains</hi> attend: Be Worth like this approv'd,</l>
<l>And show you have the Virtue to be mov'd.</l>
<l>With honest Scorn the first fam'd <hi>Cato</hi> view'd</l>
<l><hi>Rome</hi> learning Arts from <hi>Greece,</hi> whom she subdu'd;</l>
<l><pb facs="5"/>
Our Scene precariously subsists too long</l>
<l>On <hi>French</hi> Translation, and <hi>Italian</hi> Song.</l>
<l>Dare to have Sense your selves; Assert the Stage,</l>
<l>Be justly warm'd with your own Native Rage.</l>
<l>Such Plays alone should please a <hi>British</hi> Ear,</l>
<l>As <hi>Cato</hi>'s self had not disdain'd to hear.</l>

<l>THE Dawn is over-cast, the Morning low'rs,</l>
<l>And heavily in Clouds brings on the Day,</l>
<l>The great, th' important Day; big with the Fate</l>
<l>Of <hi>Cato</hi> and of <hi>Rome.</hi>—Our Father's Death</l>
<l>Would fill up all the Guilt of Civil War,</l>
<l>And close the Scene of Blood. Already <hi>Caesar</hi></l>
<l>Has ravaged more than half the Globe, and sees</l>
<l>Mankind grown thin by his destructive Sword:</l>
<l>Should he go further, Numbers would be wanting</l>
<l>To form new Battels, and support his Crimes.</l>
<l>Ye Gods, what Havock does Ambition make</l>
<l>Among your Works!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marc.</speaker>
<l>Thy steddy Temper, <hi>Portius,</hi></l>
<l>Can look on Guilt, Rebellion, Fraud, and <hi>Caesar,</hi></l>
<l>In the calm Lights of mild Philosophy;</l>
<l>I'm tortured, ev'n to Madness, when I think</l>
<l>On the proud Victor: ev'ry time he's named</l>
<l><hi>Pharsalia</hi> rises to my View—I see</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="8"/>
Th' Insulting Tyrant prancing o'er the Field</l>
<l>Strow'd with <hi>Rome</hi>'s Citizens, and drench'd in Slaughter,</l>
<l>His Horse's Hoofs wet with Patrician Blood.</l>
<l>Oh <hi>Portius,</hi> is there not some chosen Curse,</l>
<l>Some hidden Thunder in the Stores of Heav'n,</l>
<l>Red with uncommon Wrath, to blast the Man</l>
<l>Who owes his Greatness to his Country's Ruin?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, <hi>Marcus,</hi> 'tis an impious Greatness,</l>
<l>And mixt with too much Horrour to be envy'd:</l>
<l>How does the Lustre of our Father's Actions,</l>
<l>Through the dark Cloud of IIIs that cover him,</l>
<l>Break out, and burn with more triumphant Brightness!</l>
<l>His Suff'rings shine, and spread a Glory round him;</l>
<l>Greatly unfortunate, he fights the Cause</l>
<l>Of Honour, Virtue, Liberty, and <hi>Rome.</hi></l>
<l>His Sword ne'er fell but on the Guilty Head;</l>
<l>Oppression, Tyranny, and Pow'r usurp'd,</l>
<l>Draw all the Vengeance of his Arm upon 'em.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marc.</speaker>
<l>Who knows not this? But what can <hi>Cato</hi> do</l>
<l>Against a World, a base degenerate World,</l>
<l>That court's the Yoke, and bows the Neck to <hi>Caesar?</hi></l>
<l>Pent up in <hi>Utica</hi> he vainly forms</l>
<l>A poor Epitome of <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness,</l>
<l>And, cover'd with <hi>Numidian</hi> Guards, directs</l>
<l>A feeble Army, and an empty Senate,</l>
<l>Remnants of mighty Battels fought in vain.</l>
<l>By Heav'ns, such Virtues, join'd with such Success,</l>
<l>Distract my very Soul: Our Father's Fortune</l>
<l>Wou'd almost tempt us to renounce his Precepts.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Remember what our Father oft has told us:</l>
<l>The Ways of Heav'n are dark and intricate,</l>
<l>Puzzled in Mazes, and perplext with Errors;</l>
<l>Our Understanding traces 'em in vain,</l>
<l>Lost and bewilder'd in the fruitless Search;</l>
<l>Nor sees with how much Art the Windings run,</l>
<l>Nor where the regular Confusion ends.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Marc.</speaker>
<l>These are Suggestions of a Mind at Ease:</l>
<l>Oh <hi>Portius,</hi> didst thou taste but half the Griess</l>
<l>That wring my Soul, thou cou'dst not talk thus calmly.</l>
<l>Passion unpity'd, and successless Love,</l>
<l>Plant Daggers in my Heart, and aggravate</l>
<l>My other Griefs. Were but my <hi>Lucia</hi> kind!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Thou see'st not that thy Brother is thy Rival:</l>
<l>But I must hide it, for I know thy Temper. <stage>[Aside.</stage></l>
<l>Now, <hi>Marcus,</hi> now, thy Virtue's on the Proof:</l>
<l>Put forth thy utmost Strength, work ev'ry Nerve,</l>
<l>And call up all thy Father in thy Soul:</l>
<l>To quell the Tyrant Love, and guard thy Heart</l>
<l>On this weak Side, where most our Nature fails,</l>
<l>Would be a Conquest worthy <hi>Cato</hi>'s Son.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marc.</speaker>
<l><hi>Portius,</hi> the Council which I cannot take,</l>
<l>Instead of healing, but upbraids my Weakness.</l>
<l>Bid me for Honour plunge into a War</l>
<l>Of thickest Foes, and rush on certain Death,</l>
<l>Then shalt thou see that <hi>Marcus</hi> is not slow</l>
<l>To follow Glory, and confess his Father.</l>
<l>Love is not to be reason'd down, or lost</l>
<l>In high Ambition, and a Thirst of Greatness;</l>
<l>'Tis second Life, it grows into the Soul,</l>
<l>Warms ev'ry Vein, and beats in ev'ry Pulse,</l>
<l>I feel it here: My Resolution melts—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<l>Behold young <hi>Juba,</hi> the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince!</l>
<l>With how much Care he forms himself to Glory,</l>
<l>And breaks the Fierceness of his Native Temper</l>
<l>To copy out our Father's bright Example.</l>
<l>He loves our Sister <hi>Marcia,</hi> greatly loves her,</l>
<l>His Eyes, his Looks, his Actions all betray it:</l>
<l>But still the smother'd Fondness burns within him.</l>
<l>When most it swells and labours for a Vent,</l>
<l>Then Sense of Honour and Desire of Fame</l>
<l>Drive the big Passion back into his Heart.</l>
<l>What! shall an <hi>African,</hi> shall <hi>Juba</hi>'s Heir</l>
<l>Reproach great <hi>Cato</hi>'s Son, and show the World</l>

<l>When-e're did <hi>Juba,</hi> or did <hi>Portius,</hi> show</l>
<l>A Virtue that has cast me at a Distance,</l>
<l>And thrown me out in the Pursuits of Honour?</l>

<l>A Brother's Suff'rings claim a Brother's Pity.</l>

<l>Heav'n knows I pity thee: Behold my Eyes</l>
<l>Ev'n whilst I speak.—Do they not swim in Tears?</l>
<l>Were but my Heart as naked to thy View,</l>
<l><hi>Marcus</hi> would see it bleed in his Behalf.</l>

<l>Then tell me, <hi>Syphax,</hi> I conjure thee, tell me,</l>
<l>What are the Thoughts that knit thy Brow in Frowns,</l>

<l>'Tis not my Talent to conceal my Thoughts,</l>

Do they with tougher Sinews bend the Bow?</l>
<l>Or flies the Javelin swifter to its Mark,</l>
<l>Launch'd from the Vigour of a <hi>Roman</hi> Arm?</l>
<l>Who like our active <hi>African</hi> instructs</l>
<l>The fiery Steed, and trains him to his Hand?</l>
<l>Or guide's in Troops th' embattled Elephant,</l>

<l>In which your <hi>Zama</hi> does not stoop to <hi>Rome.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jub.</speaker>
<l>These all are Virtues of a meaner Rank,</l>
<l>Perfections that are placed in Bones and Nerves.</l>
<l>A <hi>Roman</hi> Soul is bent on higher Views:</l>
<l>To civilize the rude unpolish'd World,</l>
<l>And lay it under the Restraint of Laws;</l>
<l>To make Man mild and sociable to Man;</l>
<l>To cultivate the wild licentious Savage</l>
<l>With Wisdom, Discipline, and lib'ral Arts;</l>
<l>Th' Embellishments of Life: Virtues like these,</l>
<l>Make Human Nature shine, reform the Soul,</l>
<l>And break our fierce Barbarians into Men.</l>

<l>Patience kind Heav'ns!—Excuse an old Man's warmth.</l>
<l>What are these wond'rous civilizing Arts,</l>
<l>This <hi>Roman</hi> Polish, and this smooth Behaviour,</l>
<l>That render Man thus tractable and tame?</l>
<l>Are they not only to disguise our Passions,</l>
<l>To set our Looks at variance with our Thoughts,</l>
<l>To check the Starts and Sallies of the Soul,</l>
<l>And break off all its Commerce with the Tongue;</l>
<l>In short, to change us into other Creatures</l>

<l>To strike thee Dumb: Turn up thy Eyes to <hi>Cato!</hi></l>
<l>There may'st thou see to what a Godlike Height</l>
<l>The <hi>Roman</hi> Virtues lift up mortal Man.</l>
<l>While good, and just, and anxious for his Friends,</l>
<l>He's still severely bent against himself;</l>
<l>Renouncing Sleep, and Rest, and Food, and Ease,</l>
<l>He strives with Thirst and Hunger, Toil and Heat;</l>
<l>And when his Fortune sets before him all</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="16"/>
The Pomps and Pleasures that his Soul can wish,</l>
<l>His rigid Virtue will accept of none.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Syph.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, Prince, there's not an <hi>African</hi></l>
<l>That traverses our vast <hi>Numidian</hi> Desarts</l>
<l>In quest of Prey, and lives upon his Bow,</l>
<l>But better practises these boasted Virtues.</l>
<l>Coarse are his Meals, the Fortune of the Chase,</l>
<l>Amidst the running Stream he slakes his Thirst,</l>
<l>Toil's all the Day, and at th' approach of Night</l>
<l>On the first friendly Bank he throws him down,</l>
<l>Or rests his Head upon a Rock 'till Morn:</l>
<l>Then rises fresh, pursues his wonted Game,</l>
<l>And if the following Day he chance to find</l>
<l>A new Repast, or an untasted Spring,</l>
<l>Blesses his Stars, and thinks it Luxury.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jub.</speaker>
<l>Thy Prejudices, <hi>Syphax,</hi> won't discern</l>
<l>What Virtues grow from Ignorance and Choice,</l>
<l>Nor how the Hero differs from the Brute.</l>
<l>But grant that others cou'd with equal Glory</l>
<l>Look down on Pleasures and the Baits of Sense;</l>
<l>Where shall we find the Man that bears Affliction,</l>
<l>Great and Majestick in his Griefs, like <hi>Cato?</hi></l>
<l>Heav'ns, with what Strength, what Steadiness of Mind,</l>
<l>He Triumphs in the midst of all his Sufferings!</l>
<l>How does he rise against a Load of Woes,</l>
<l>And thank the Gods that throw the Weight upon him!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Syph.</speaker>
<l>'Tis Pride, rank Pride, and Haughtiness of Soul:</l>

<l>Had not your Royal Father thought so highly</l>
<l>Of <hi>Roman</hi> Virtue, and of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Cause,</l>

<l><hi>Syphax,</hi> this old Man's Talk (tho' Honey flow'd</l>

<l><hi>Cato</hi>'s displeas'd, and <hi>Marcia</hi> lost for ever!</l>

<l><hi>Juba</hi> command's <hi>Numidia</hi>'s hardy Troops,</l>

<l>To do an Act that wou'd destroy my Honour?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Syph.</speaker>
<l>Gods, I cou'd tear my Beard to hear you talk!</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Syph.</speaker>
<l>The boasted Ancestors of these great Men,</l>

<l>This Dread of Nations, this Almighty <hi>Rome,</hi></l>
<l>That comprehends in her wide Empire's Bounds</l>
<l>All under Heav'n, was founded on a Rape.</l>
<l><hi>Your</hi> Scipios', Caesar's, Pompey's, <hi>and your</hi> Cato's,</l>

<l>Thou thus presumest to treat thy Prince with Scorn?</l>

<l>Why will you rive my Heart with such Expressions?</l>
<l>Do's not old <hi>Syphax</hi> follow you to War?</l>

<l>His trembling Hand, and crush beneath a Cask</l>

<l>My Prince may strike me dead, and I'll be dumb:</l>
<l>But whilst I live I must not hold my Tongue,</l>

</sp>

<l>That <hi>Syphax</hi> loves you, and wou'd sacrifice</l>
<l>His Life, nay more, his Honour in your Service.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jub.</speaker>
<l><hi>Syphax,</hi> I know thou lov'st me, but indeed</l>
<l>Thy Zeal for <hi>Juba</hi> carried thee too far.</l>
<l>Honour's a sacred Tie, the Law of Kings,</l>
<l>The noble Mind's distinguishing Perfection,</l>
<l>That aid's and strengthens Virtue, where it meets her,</l>
<l>And imitates her Actions, where she is not:</l>
<l>It ought not to be sported with.</l>

<sp>

<l>By Heav'ns</l>
<l>I'm ravisht when you talk thus, tho' you chide me.</l>
<l>Alas, I've hitherto been used to think</l>
<l>A blind officious Zeal to serve my King</l>
<l>The ruling Principle, that ought to burn</l>
<l>And quench all others in a Subject's Heart.</l>

<l>By the same Duties that oblige their Prince!</l>
</sp>

<l><hi>Syphax,</hi> thou now begin'st to speak thy self.</l>
<l><hi>Numidia</hi>'s grown a Scorn among the Nations</l>
<l>For Breach of publick Vows. Our <hi>Punick</hi> Faith</l>
<l>Is infamous, and branded to a Proverb.</l>
<l><hi>Syphax,</hi> we'll join our Cares, to purge away</l>
<l>Our Country's Crimes, and clear her Reputation.</l>
</sp>

<l>Believe me, Prince, you make old <hi>Syphax</hi> weep</l>

<l><hi>Syphax,</hi> farewell. I'll hence, and try to find</l>

<l>All hail, <hi>Sempronius!</hi></l>

<l>The Fury of a Siege, before it yields.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Semp.</speaker>
<l><hi>Syphax,</hi> we both were on the Verge of Fate:</l>
<l><hi>Lucius</hi> declared for Peace, and Terms were offer'd</l>
<l>To <hi>Cato</hi> by a Messenger from <hi>Caesar.</hi></l>
<l>Shou'd they submit, ere our Designs are ripe,</l>

<l>Thou hast seen Mount <hi>Atlas:</hi></l>
<l>While Storms and Tempests thunder on its Brows,</l>
<l>And Oceans break their Billows at its Feet,</l>
<l>It stands unmoved, and glorie's in its Height.</l>

Such is that haughty Man; his tow'ring Soul,</l>
<l>'Midst all the Shocks and Injuries of Fortune,</l>
<l>Rises superior, and looks down on <hi>Caesar.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Syph.</speaker>
<l>But what's this Messenger?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Semp.</speaker>
<l>I've practis'd with him,</l>
<l>And found a Means to let the Victor know</l>
<l>That <hi>Syphax</hi> and <hi>Sempronius</hi> are his Friends.</l>
<l>But let me now examine in my Turn:</l>
<l>Is <hi>Juba</hi> fixt?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Syph.</speaker>
<l>Yes, but it is to <hi>Cato.</hi></l>
<l>I've try'd the Force of ev'ry Reason on him,</l>
<l>Sooth'd and carress'd, been angry, sooth'd again,</l>
<l>Lay'd Safety, Life, and Int'rest in his Sight,</l>
<l>But all are vain, he scorns them all for <hi>Cato.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Semp.</speaker>
<l>Come, 'tis no Matter, we shall do without him.</l>
<l>He'll make a pretty Figure in a Triumph,</l>
<l>And serve to trip before the Victor's Chariot.</l>
<l><hi>Syphax,</hi> I now may hope thou hast forsook</l>
<l>Thy <hi>Juba</hi>'s Cause, and wishest <hi>Marcia</hi> mine.</l>

<l><hi>Syphax,</hi> I love that Woman; tho' I curse</l>
<l>Her and my self, yet spight of me, I love her.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Syph.</speaker>
<l>Make <hi>Cato</hi> sure, and give up <hi>Utica,</hi></l>

<l>The factious Leaders are our Friends, that spread</l>
<l>Murmurs and Discontents among the Soldiers.</l>

<l>THanks to my Stars, I have not ranged about</l>

<l>To love thy Person, 'ere I knew thy Merit;</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Port.</speaker>
<l><hi>Marcus,</hi> the Friendships of the World are oft</l>
<l>Confed'racies in Vice, or Leagues of Pleasure;</l>
<l>Ours has severest Virtue for its Basis,</l>
<l>And such a Friendship end's not but with Life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marc.</speaker>
<l><hi>Portius,</hi> thou know'st my Soul in all its Weakness;</l>
<l>Then prithee spare me on its tender Side,</l>

<l>What means this Heaviness that hangs upon me?</l>
<l>This Lethargy that creeps through all my Senses?</l>
<l>Nature oppress'd, and harrass'd out with Care,</l>
<l>Sinks down to Rest. This once I'll favour her.</l>
<l>That my awaken'd Soul may take her Flight,</l>
<l>Renew'd in all her Strength, and fresh with Life,</l>
<l>An Off'ring fit for Heav'n. Let Guilt or Fear</l>

<l>Wou'd'st thou betray me? Wou'd'st thou give me up</l>

<l>O Sir, forgive your Son,</l>

<l>How am I sure it is not the last Time</l>

<l>Our Father will not cast away a Life</l>

<l>Thoughts full of Peace. He has dispatcht me hence</l>

<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>Alas, I tremble when I think on <hi>Cato,</hi></l>
<l>In every View, in every Thought I tremble!</l>
<l><hi>Cato</hi> is stern, and awful as a God,</l>
<l>He knows not how to wink at humne Frailty,</l>
<l>Or pardon Weakness, that he never felt.</l>

<l>And ever shall lament, unhappy Youth!</l>

<l>O <hi>Marcia,</hi> I have seen thy Godlike Father:</l>

<l>And bear's it up in all its wonted Greatness.</l>
<l>A kind refreshing Sleep is fall'n upon him:</l>
<l><pb n="60" facs="66"/>
I saw him stretcht at Ease, his Fancy lost</l>
<l>In pleasing Dreams; as I drew near his Couch,</l>
<l>He smiled, and cry'd, <hi>Caesar</hi> thou can'st not hurt me.</l>

<l>His Mind still labour's with some dreadful Thought.</l>

<speaker>Port.</speaker>
<l>As I was hasting to the Port, where now</l>
<l>My Father's Friends, impatient for a Passage,</l>
<l>Accuse the ling'ring Winds, a Sail arrived</l>
<l>From <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Son, who through the Realms of <hi>Spain</hi></l>
<l>Call's out for Vengeance on his Father's Death,</l>
<l>And rouse's the whole Nation up to Arms.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE,</head>
<byline>By Dr. <hi>GARTH.</hi></byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Porter.</hi></byline>
<lg>
<l>WHAT odd fantastick Things we Women do!</l>
<l>Who wou'd not listen when young Lovers woo?</l>
<l>But die a Maid, yet have the Choice of Two!</l>
<l>Ladies are often cruel to their Cost;</l>
<l>To give you Pain, themselves they punish most.</l>
<l>Vows of Virginity shou'd well be weigh'd;</l>
<l>Too oft they're cancell'd, tho' in Convents made.</l>
<l>Wou'd you revenge such rash Resolves—you may:</l>
<l>Be spightful—and believe the thing we say,</l>
<l>We hate you when you're easily said Nay.</l>
<l>How needless, if you knew us, were your Fears?</l>
<l>Let Love have Eyes, and Beauty will have Ears.</l>
<l>Our Hearts are form'd, as you your selves wou'd chuse,</l>
<l>Too proud to ask, too humble to refuse:</l>
<l>We give to Merit, and to Wealth we sell;</l>
<l>He sighs with most Success that settles well.</l>
<l>The Woes of Wedlock with the Joys we mix;</l>
<l>'Tis best repenting in a Coach and six.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Blame not our Conduct, since we but pursue</l>
<l>Those lively Lessons we have learn'd from you:</l>
<l>Your Breasts no more the Fire of Beauty warms,</l>
<l>But wicked Wealth usurps the Power of Charms;</l>
<l><pb facs="70"/>
What Pains to get the Gaudy Thing you hate,</l>
<l>To swell in Show, and be a Wretch in State!</l>
<l>At Plays you ogle, at the Ring you bow;</l>
<l>Even Churches are no Sanctuaries now.</l>
<l>There, golden Idols all your Vows receive;</l>
<l>She is no Goddess that has nought to give.</l>
<l>Oh, may once more the happy Age appear,</l>
<l>When Words were artless, and the Thoughts sincere;</l>
<l>When Gold and Grandeur were unenvy'd Things,</l>
<l>And Courts less coveted than Groves and Springs.</l>
<l>Love then shall only mourn when Truth complains,</l>
<l>And Constancy feel Transport in its Chains.</l>
<l>Sighs with Success their own soft Anguish tell,</l>
<l>And Eyes shall utter what the Lips conceal:</l>
<l>Virtue again to its bright Station climb,</l>
<l>And Beauty fear no Enemy but Time.</l>
<l>The Fair shall listen to Desert alone,</l>
<l>And every <hi>Lucia</hi> find a <hi>Cato</hi>'s Son.</l>
