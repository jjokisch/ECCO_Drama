<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR;
And Spoken by MR. HARLEY.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>WHILE fears and hopes alternate thoughts suggest,</l>
<l>And now disturb, now soothe the Author's breast;</l>
<l>While expectation breathes an awful pause,</l>
<l>Ere yet the ready hand the curtain draws,</l>
<l>Ere yet the action glows—I come a spy,</l>
<l>To cast around a reconnoit'ring eye.</l>
<l>Yet then, as I this fearful Pit explore,</l>
<l>Where Authors sometimes fall to rise no more,</l>
<l>Here when th' Adventurer dares you to the field,</l>
<l>If his fond efforts some small merit yield,</l>
<l>I've seen your gen'rous arm forbear the blow,</l>
<l>And raise to life and fame the grateful foe.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>For you, the boist'rous inmates of the sky!</l>
<l>Bold is the man who dares your pow'r defy;</l>
<l>With you confusion her loud compact forms,</l>
<l>You ride the clouds, and are yourselves the storms.</l>
<l>Yet have I seen you mitigate your rage,</l>
<l>And spare the Adventurer struggling on the Stage;</l>
<l><pb n="vii" facs="7"/>If in some scenes (the rest tho' feebly done)</l>
<l>Unerring Nature own'd her genuine Son,</l>
<l>Your glowing soul has grasp'd the Author's cause,</l>
<l>And hurl'd around the thunder of applause.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>For you, ye glittering Amazonian train,</l>
<l>Whose power is dreaded on the critic plain!</l>
<l>Tho' marshal'd to the war by taste severe,</l>
<l>Yet meek indulgence follows in the rear:</l>
<l>And oft on beauty's cheek I've lov'd to trace,</l>
<l>Soft stealing down, the holy tear of grace.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Rais'd by the thoughts these soothing hopes create,</l>
<l>I'll bid the Bard come forth, and meet his fate,</l>
<l>The tyrant Terror from his breast erase,</l>
<l>Rush on the scene, and combat for your praise.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>IT is not action only that adorns</l>
<l>The soldier's character, it is patience,</l>
<l>Calm and induring in the rugged hour</l>
<l>Of want, that forms the nobler part of duty:</l>
<l>You, my lov'd sons, and all your fellow-sufferers,</l>
<l>Have well that rigorous iron task perform'd.</l>
<l>But now a smoother train of hours advances;</l>
<l>The truce, which at to-morrow's dawn takes place,</l>
<l>Will enable me from out the northern gate</l>
<l>To dismiss the women, the aged and the infirm,</l>
<l>Then disencumber'd of its useless numbers</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="10"/>This foe-encircled town shall raise its head;</l>
<l>The hand of scarceness shall no more dispense</l>
<l>Her meagre morsel to th' exhausted soldier,</l>
<l>But cheering competency shall provide</l>
<l>The meal.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>'Tis well! yet then inform me, Sir,</l>
<l>How you'll employ th' invaluable hours</l>
<l>That still precede the truce?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Our gallant men</l>
<l>Have been severely tried, and worn with toil.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Their toil-enfeebled bodies still enclose</l>
<l>The mounting spirit of unwearied vigor.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Prompt as the hawk to dart upon his prey.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>The foe since yesterday appears to have lost</l>
<l>Half of his wonted intrepidity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>That show'r of arrows we pour'd down at eve</l>
<l>Hath somewhat quench'd their ardor!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Be it so;</l>
<l>But tell me what is now your present purpose:</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="11"/>Methinks that swelling to some bold design</l>
<l>Your bosom labours.—Speak, my Valentine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Command my elder brother, Sir, to speak.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Unfold then, Archibald, this mysterious something,</l>
<l>This painful secret that disturbs you both.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Last night, as we reclin'd upon our couch,</l>
<l>Still talking o'er (as is our wonted manner)</l>
<l>The various hazard of the busy day,</l>
<l>We wish'd, we fondly wish'd, that ere the truce</l>
<l>Should intervene, some daring enterprize</l>
<l>Might be attempted under our direction:</l>
<l>Thus we convers'd in sacred confidence</l>
<l>Till as our weak'ning voices died away</l>
<l>We wearied into rest—'twas then an image—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Mark, Sir, what now my brother will unfold.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>'Twas then an image rush'd upon my sight,</l>
<l>It shew'd as one of the angelic train,</l>
<l>A circling glory glitter'd o'er his head,</l>
<l>A smile benignant beautified his lip,</l>
<l>And thus he spoke—'Sons of the valiant Seaton,</l>
<l>Arise and hasten to the southern gate,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="12"/>Thence dart upon the foe.'—The vision ceas'd</l>
<l>And vanish'd into air! while a rude noise</l>
<l>Like the fierce struggle of contending spears</l>
<l>Suddenly waked us! Starting from my couch,</l>
<l>And ere I cou'd communicate my dream,</l>
<l>Valentine with impatient voice disclos'd</l>
<l>The mutual vision.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>'Twas as he relates;</l>
<l>By honor's winnow'd purity I swear</l>
<l>The nightly visitation also came</l>
<l>To me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>I hazard no impeachment of</l>
<l>Your truth; yet then, endearing children, tell me</l>
<l>How can a prudent tender parent send</l>
<l>His valiant sons to danger's precipice</l>
<l>At the fantastic impulse of a dream?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>In the old time we read that dreams have often</l>
<l>Been the prophetic leaders to success.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Oh do not, Sir, with caution's chill restraint</l>
<l>O'ershade the splendid purpose of our soul.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Let the bright vision be forgot, if that</l>
<l>Offend you, and attend to reason's voice:</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="13"/>Does not the weary foe anticipate</l>
<l>Th' approaching truce, and guard neglectingly</l>
<l>The southern gate?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>'Tis a mask'd neglect,</l>
<l>It is the couchant lion prompt to seize</l>
<l>Th' unwary prey—ah! trust not to his stern</l>
<l>Repose.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>If danger still must check the current</l>
<l>Of enterprize, tell, tell me, Father, wherefore</l>
<l>You rear'd us in the hardy school of war?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>The road to martial glory well thou know'st</l>
<l>Is not gay-sprinkled o'er with flowers, but broken</l>
<l>Helmets, shiver'd spears, and blood-stain'd arrows</l>
<l>Choak up th' aspiring path of fame's ascent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>To be restrain'd when proud occasion calls,</l>
<l>'Twere better thou hadst led me to some cloister,</l>
<l>Where holy peace resides, o'er-canopied</l>
<l>By antient roofs, that ever shade her from</l>
<l>The madd'ning sun-beams of ambition's sky.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Forbear to torture thus a parent's feelings.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="14"/>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Indulgent Father, rest assur'd we both</l>
<l>Pay homage to the thought that now disturbs you;</l>
<l>But with th' experienced Melvil we have just</l>
<l>Conferr'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>And he undoubtedly contemn'd</l>
<l>Your gaudy dream, that meteor of the brain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>'Twas not the meteor of a heated brain,</l>
<l>It was a sun-beam of revealing Heaven,</l>
<l>It was the sympathetic glow of two</l>
<l>According minds.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Of this enough—What said</l>
<l>Th' experienc'd Melvil?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>After due attention</l>
<l>To our proposal, he first stamp'd it with</l>
<l>The seal of his applause, and then added</l>
<l>Arguments that embodied as it were</l>
<l>Our enterprize, and brighten'd it with the</l>
<l>Calm colouring of reason.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>I will myself</l>
<l>Confer with Melvil; and if he has words</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="15"/>To smooth the rugged doubts that vex my mind,</l>
<l>Think not, my valiant sons, I shall withhold</l>
<l>You from the object of your bold request</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>To keep unsullied the bright martial name</l>
<l>Of Seaton, is indeed my proudest wish.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>And if thy Valentine might add his mite</l>
<l>To the rich treasury of his Father's fame,</l>
<l>He would be happy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Wait till I return.</l>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Excellent man! his ardour to promote</l>
<l>Our cause, and his solicitude about</l>
<l>Our safety, combat and distract his will.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>More active, warm, and forcible affection</l>
<l>Was ne'er embosom'd in a father's soul;</l>
<l>And therefore much I fear that Melvil can't</l>
<l>Subdue his scruples.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Oft have I observ'd</l>
<l>That Melvil's clear illumin'd manly judgment</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="16"/>Possesses something like magnetic power,</l>
<l>Which still attracts opinion to his side.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>May that attractive power be at this moment</l>
<l>Endued with double influence, that my Father</l>
<l>Withholding his restraint, I might unbounded</l>
<l>Spring against the foe!—This common praise</l>
<l>That's claim'd by every soldier, ill supplies</l>
<l>My starv'd and craving appetite of fame.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Endearing Valentine, think not that I</l>
<l>Reprove these flashes of an ardent mind;</l>
<l>But should your mounting wishes meet controul,</l>
<l>Wound not a Father's tender caution with</l>
<l>Reproach.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Sooner than wound his feeling mind</l>
<l>With sullen, splenetic, unduteous carriage,</l>
<l>I wou'd, like the Spartan boy (who silently</l>
<l>Endur'd the gnawing fox) conceal my sorrow,</l>
<l>Though, like the savage animal, it should</l>
<l>Prey upon my vitals.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Consider also</l>
<l>This warlike age will gratify your wishes</l>
<l>With many a future enterprize! The morn</l>
<l>Of life is now but breaking on thy youth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="17"/>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Talk not to me of early youth: behold</l>
<l>Edward's brave son, whose age but equals mine—</l>
<l>Oh were I equal with him in renown!</l>
<l>Behold that boy on Cressy's wond'ring field</l>
<l>Reaping an immortal harvest, while I</l>
<l>Enveloped in obscurity—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Desist,</l>
<l>I hear some step approaching.
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> DONALDSON.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>'Tis my Father;</l>
<l>Ah, no! 'tis Donaldson. Say, hast thou seen</l>
<l>The Governor?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DONALDSON.</speaker>
<l>I saw him as I pass'd by</l>
<l>In close conference engag'd with Melvil.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Know'st thou the subject of their conference?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DONALDSON.</speaker>
<l>There breathes an ignorant rumour of a sally,</l>
<l>Propos seems by Archibald and you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="18"/>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>It is as you have darkly heard, and here</l>
<l>Impatiently we wait the Governor's</l>
<l>Return.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>See, here he comes.</l>
<stage><hi>Enter Sir</hi> ALEXANDER.</stage>
<l>Hail to my Father!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Sir, you appear disturbed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Ah! tell me, Archibald,</l>
<l>Is't with a look of cheerfulness a parent</l>
<l>Resigns his duteous children to the hazard</l>
<l>Of a fearful enterprize?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Yet then reflect,</l>
<l>Melvil the military sage approves</l>
<l>The enterprize.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>But Melvil has no children,</l>
<l>His smooth sail of honour meets no adverse</l>
<l>Gales to check its progress.—'Tis not thus with me:</l>
<l>Say how shall I endure the keen reproofs</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="19"/>Of Ethelberta, when she is inform'd</l>
<l>That I have sent, without the imperious call</l>
<l>Of stern necessity, her darling children</l>
<l>To the path of danger?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Speak not of danger,</l>
<l>'Tis the soldier's charter, his best privilege.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Something withholds my full consent.</l>
<l>And calls my judgment to severe account!</l>
<l>Forgive this trembling caution in a parent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Had England's warlike king suppress'd his son's</l>
<l>Ascending soul, on her proud list of victories</l>
<l>We should not have found the name of Cressy!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>'Twas on the summit of a neighb'ring hill</l>
<l>The father stood, and saw his youthful son</l>
<l>Oppose the pride of France; and when the Earls</l>
<l>Of Warwick and of Oxford sent a herald,</l>
<l>To claim immediate succour from the king—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Did not the king reply, Go tell the lords</l>
<l>Who sent you, that while my boy 's alive</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="20"/>They will require my aid in vain: the glory</l>
<l>Of this great day shall be his own?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Enough!</l>
<l>Your arguments prevail, and you have won me</l>
<l>To your request.—Go, join the skilful Melvil,</l>
<l>The Nestor of the war, and strictly mark</l>
<l>His words and well-weigh'd counsel—first receive</l>
<l>The anxious Father's blessing.
<stage>(Embraces his sons.)</stage></l>
<l>May that Power</l>
<l>Who oft hath shielded me in many a combat,</l>
<l>Oh! may that guardian, kind, benignant Angel</l>
<l>Now hover o'er my children!</l>
<stage>(Leads them to the door, and returns.)</stage>
<l>Donaldson,</l>
<l>This is an awful moment for a Father!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DONALDSON.</speaker>
<l>Think not so deeply, Sir, nor feed your mind</l>
<l>With busy tort'ring vain surmises; think</l>
<l>How often you've encounter'd perils imminent,</l>
<l>And still return'd with glory.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Unavailing</l>
<l>Remembrance! rear'd as I have almost been</l>
<l>In storms of battle, say what paternal</l>
<l>Bosom will not feel a warm renew'd affection</l>
<l>For two such sons staged to the front of danger?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="21"/>
<speaker>DONALDSON.</speaker>
<l>But should not Ethelberta be informed?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Ah! there you probe my bosom's tender part:</l>
<l>No, Donaldson, the mother must not know</l>
<l>The gathering storm that's brooding o'er her sons;</l>
<l>Her quick'ning apprehension would outrun</l>
<l>The deed, and picture to itself images</l>
<l>That would distract her.—'Tis my duty, my</l>
<l>Religion, still to shield her mind from all</l>
<l>That may assail it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DONALDSON.</speaker>
<l>Many a time have</l>
<l>I listen'd to the splendid narrative</l>
<l>Of Ethelberta's virtues.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>From the happy hour</l>
<l>I first call'd her mine, unto this moment,</l>
<l>She has with unremitting fortitude</l>
<l>Attended me through many a rugged day.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DONALDSON.</speaker>
<l>I think that England triumphs in her birth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>At those fam'd tournaments that Edward held</l>
<l>At Windsor, did I first behold that matchless</l>
<l><pb n="14" facs="22"/>Woman, tho' attractive, yet not dazzling:</l>
<l>As looks the softer green amidst the radiant</l>
<l>Colours of the vernal bow, so Ethelberta</l>
<l>Seem'd 'mid the circling flush of British beauties.</l>
<l>—This gorgeous castle, and its proud delights,</l>
<l>The daughter of Earl Nevil willingly</l>
<l>Resign'd, to share with me the perils of</l>
<l>The late crusade: This faithful Wife, this soothing</l>
<l>Companion of my way, still smooth'd the harrow'd</l>
<l>Walk of war—Ev'n as the wall-flower rears its form,</l>
<l>And smiles and flourishes 'midst tombs and ruins,</l>
<l>So Ethelberta's warm affection grew</l>
<l>'Mid sickness, want, fatigue, distress, and danger.</l>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ANSELM.</stage>
<l>Hail, holy father! what dost thou report?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELM.</speaker>
<l>With hasty step I come, Sir, to acquaint you</l>
<l>That the bold enterprize is well prepar'd:</l>
<l>Along the subterraneous windings did</l>
<l>The gallant troops advance, 'till they approach'd</l>
<l>The chapel of St. Andrew, near the gate</l>
<l>That issues to the field: here paus'd the band—</l>
<l>And then in sacred silence lowly bending</l>
<l>Dedicated themselves unto their country.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>What follow'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="23"/>
<speaker>ANSELM.</speaker>
<l>Then with solemn voice I utter'd</l>
<l>Warm from my throbbing heart, the benediction</l>
<l>That is appointed in the hour of danger.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Yet tell me what directions then were given?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELM.</speaker>
<l>It was agreed that your two sons, attended</l>
<l>By a chosen few, should rush upon the foe,</l>
<l>While Melvil with a greater number should,</l>
<l>Taking a wide circling path, fall on the rear.</l>
<l>Brave Melvil first began the silent march:</l>
<l>Then did your sons lead forth their gallant men</l>
<l>Thro' the deep awful gloom—the signal for</l>
<l>The onset is to be the convent bell</l>
<l>That tolls at midnight.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Wherefore did I yield me</l>
<l>To their wild request? Oh say, is 't yet too late?</l>
<l>The leave they wrested from me I may still</l>
<l>Recall.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELM.</speaker>
<l>The die is cast, and you must wait</l>

<l>Dear Ethelberta, be not thus alarm'd!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ETHELBERTA.</speaker>
<l>My blood runs cold.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Ah, rather let it glow at my recital:</l>
<l>Your sons have gain'd the warrior's best reward,</l>
<l>Unsullied fame. Three times did their small force</l>
<l>Drive back their triple-number'd foes; at length,</l>
<l>By their encreasing powers subdued (with nine</l>
<l>Of their brave men remaining) they submitted</l>
<l>To be captives.</l>

<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Melvil applauded</l>
<l>What my sons propos'd; and to the energy</l>

<l>What says the hasty Valentine?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Command</l>
<l>Your rising indignation, I'll explain.—</l>
<l>Allow us, Father, for some few moments,</l>
<l>To confer alone, that free from all restraint</l>
<l>I may to Archibald disclose my mind,</l>
<l>And utter arguments that may subdue</l>

<l>Prevent th' extinction of our family.</l>

<l>Perish to the root the name of Seaton,</l>
<l>And let oblivion's night o'ershade the proud</l>

<l>Consent to that which must degrade and shrink</l>
<l>Me in my own esteem!</l>

<l>Come, Ethelberta, let us for a while</l>
<l>Retire, and leave them to confer alone.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ETHELBERTA.</speaker>
<l>Well the high theme of your discourse I know,</l>
<l>It is a contest for the palm of death:</l>
<l>But in this glorious conflict still remember</l>
<l>What is due to your afflicted Mother.</l>
<l>If any plan, expedient, or device,</l>
<l>Allied to honour, should suggest itself;</l>
<l>If any beam should pierce this awful gloom,</l>
<l>Admit its sacred influence on your mind,</l>
<l>And save me from despair.</l>

<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Fear is no inmate of thy glowing breast;</l>
<l>Yet then reflect that other thoughts than those</l>
<l>That courage breathes must sometimes regulate</l>
<l>A soldier's conduct. Say, hast thou not heard</l>
<l>That mercy, resignation, are the nobler</l>
<l>Duties of a soldier?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Where is now that</l>
<l>Mercy claim'd? where call'd for? mercy on whom?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Mercy on your Parents, and on your country.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>This puerile declamation moves me not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>I speak the language of a mind sincere,</l>
<l>To one who is my friend as well as brother,</l>
<l>For whom my partial fondness ne'er was doubted.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>He loves me not who does not love my fame!</l>
<l>Was I to yield to your ill-tim'd suggestion,</l>
<l>Wou'd not each finger mark me as I pass,</l>
<l>As one who skulks behind the privilege</l>
<l>Of eldership to save himself from death?</l>
<l><pb n="36" facs="44"/>I feel dishonour as I feel a wound—</l>
<l>The fatal spot to which we both aspire,</l>
<l>Is glory's prize, is honour's awful station,</l>
<l>And I now claim it as my sacred birth-right.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>I contend no longer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Let me hasten,</l>
<l>Fly to my Father to proclaim the news,</l>
<l>That Valentine at length consents to live.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>Allow me one short moment, and be calm:</l>
<l>Say, wilt thou, with an avarice of fame,</l>
<l>Demand exclusively the meed of glory?</l>
<l>Wilt thou pursue the path that leads to death,</l>
<l>And leave thy faithful Valentine behind?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARCHIBALD.</speaker>
<l>Cease, generous brother, or thou 'lt break my heart—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALENTINE.</speaker>
<l>When first I quitted childhood's lowly vale,</l>
<l>Eager with you I climb'd youth's arduous height,</l>
<l>Whence greater scenes expanded on-my view;</l>
<l>Still our pursuits, consenting to one plan,</l>
<l>Our lives like wedded streams united roll'd;</l>

<l>The rigorous duty of their situation—</l>

<sp>

<l>What duty is more pressing or more sacred</l>

<l>Of Heaven!</l>
</sp>

<speaker>JULIANA.</speaker>
<l>Their better judgment held them from</l>

<l>Of two sons hast'ning to untimely death</l>
<l>Wou'd rend your heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ETHELBERTA.</speaker>
<l>It must be so, it was,</l>
<l>It was their love that urg'd them to avoid me!</l>
<l>The cloud of dark surmise that here was gathering</l>
<l>Begins to melt in air! and my full heart</l>
<l>Expands to all its wonted warm affection.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>JULIANA.</speaker>
<l>To this affection join a confidence</l>
<l>That all may yet be well.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ETHELBERTA.</speaker>
<l>I dare not cast</l>
<l>A meeting glance upon th' approaching hour.—</l>
<l>Cou'd I but raise my sinking mind to the</l>
<l>Faint hope, that the arrows haply might not</l>
<l><pb n="41" facs="49"/>Reach my children!—That the tyrant may</l>
<l>Relent of his fell purpose! Vain endeavour!—</l>
<l>Each way I look I meet despair.—Yet now—</l>
<l>A thought possesses me—Indulge my weakness—</l>
<l>Ah! pity the disease that flies to such</l>
<l>A remedy—I've heard a skilful sorceress</l>
<l>Does in this town reside, whose magic power</l>
<l>Unfolds the future to her trembling visitant—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIANA.</speaker>
<l>It is as you report, and many a hapless</l>
<l>Virgin, many a distressful mother,</l>
<l>Have consulted her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ETHELBERTA.</speaker>
<l>'Tis said she rivals</l>
<l>The weird sisterhood of ancient days,</l>
<l>While o'er her mind pale prophecy hangs fluttering,</l>
<l>The dread vaunt-courier of futurity—</l>
<l>Perchance this deeply-skill'd magician may</l>
<l>Transport my ignorant fears beyond th' event.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JULIANA.</speaker>
<l>Yet say, was she by her exploring art</l>
<l>To raise your ignorant fears to horrid certainties—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ETHELBERTA.</speaker>
<l>Better to know the worse, than thus to live</l>
<l>In apprehension, unrelenting agony!—</l>
<l>Can'st thou inform me where the sorceress dwells?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="42" facs="50"/>
<speaker>JULIANA.</speaker>
<l>Her lonely cell is seen not far from hence,</l>
<l>Amidst the ruins of an ancient cloister,</l>
<l>Upon the burial ground! There on a seat</l>
<l>Of ebony, o'erspread with human skulls,</l>
<l>She exerciseth her tremendous function.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ETHELBERTA.</speaker>
<l>Whence does the hag derive her daring mission?</l>
<l>Is 't from on high, or from the caves of hell?</l>
<l>Does she not lift her impious hand to rend</l>
<l>The sanctuary-veil that hangs 'tween men and angels?</l>
<l>And on the breast of heaven she sends a glance</l>
<l>Profane!</l>
</sp>

<l>This deep reflection will avert</l>
<l>Your anxious mind from its new-form'd purpose.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ETHELBERTA.</speaker>
<l>Let me be wretched, let me not be impious:</l>
<l>Never will I tread the path that leads to</l>
<l>Her unhallow'd cell.—Another thought occurs,</l>
<l>Which meets my heart's consent—Come, come what may,</l>
<l>I'll go in person to the hostile camp,</l>
<l>There, rushing on the rude barbarian,</l>
<l>I will demand my children.</l>

<l>Consider</l>
<l>What dangers you'll encounter, to what insults</l>
<l>You there may be expos'd: 'tis likely you</l>

<l>Within the precincts of a lonesome dungeon.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ETHELBERTA.</speaker>
<l>Talk not to me of dangers, I despise them.</l>
<l>Say, hast thou not beheld the bold sea-eagle,</l>
<l>When her dear young one from the rock hath fall'n,</l>
<l>Descend undaunted to the roaring main,</l>
<l>Dash with her throbbing breast the waves asunder,</l>
<l>To snatch the nestling from the ravenous shark!</l>

<l>Yes, Anselm, I confess I glory in</l>
<l>These children—their abrupt departure wakes</l>
<l>At once my wonder and delight! Say, has</l>
<l>It not a relish of the antique manners,</l>
<l>Some proud resemblance of the Roman mind?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELM.</speaker>
<l>This mutual dedication of themselves</l>
<l>To certain death will ornament our annals.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>As torrents feed the river, so my sons</l>
<l>Swell the strong current of my country's fame.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELM.</speaker>
<l>You also share your part in this sublime</l>
<l>Transaction.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>The renown is their's, and mine</l>
<l>Is the distress.—My scene in this deep drama</l>
<l>Is to bid my archers shoot their arrows</l>
<l>Where my defenceless sons will be expos'd</l>
<l>To their full rage.—Alas! I fear, good father,</l>
<l>I have not virtue equal to the task.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELM.</speaker>
<l>Virtue is ever found superior to</l>
<l><pb n="45" facs="53"/>The rugged task; and, like the water-plant,</l>
<l>Ascends still higher than the swelling flood.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Was ever father so severely tried?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELM.</speaker>
<l>Image to yourself that you are acting</l>

<l>Look up unto th' approving smile of Heav'n!</l>

<l>He 's not of English birth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIR ALEXANDER.</speaker>
<l>Of that you may be certain:</l>
<l>Humanity adorns the English soldier;</l>
<l>It is the wholesome gale that ventilates</l>
<l>Their heart, from the low subaltern up to</l>
<l>The royal youth who now in Gallia leads</l>
<l>His valiant band—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELM.</speaker>
<l>From Norway is he not,</l>
<l>This wretch who outrages a parent's feelings?</l>

<l>Dazzled by his enterprizing spirit,</l>
<l>Gave him to command the troops that now invest us.</l>

<l>But tell me, has your sons' abrupt departure</l>
<l>Yet reach'd the ear of hapless Ethelberta?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>I know not that.—I must not now approach</l>

<l>Pour'd forth a length'ning train.—The aged warriors</l>
<l><pb n="47" facs="55"/>Pass'd on in mournful silence.—This dismission,</l>
<l>Which mark'd their inutility, appear'd</l>
<l>To humble and degrade them.</l>

<l>'Tis a cruel</l>

<l>Who would</l>

<lg>
<l>AS now I come unarm'd, without a dart,</l>
<l>I fear I can't presume to touch your heart;</l>
<l>But your indulgence, here so often sound,</l>
<l>Has on my heart, at least, imprest a wound;</l>
<l>A sacred wound! which I am proud to feel,</l>
<l>Which, if I know myself, will never heal.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Methinks I hear you say, Dear Mrs. <hi>POPE,</hi></l>
<l>Amidst what mould'ring Annals did you grope,</l>
<l>And dig, from out the mine of tragic ore,</l>
<l>A tale unfashion'd from the days of yore—</l>
<l>Where two wild Boys take such prodigious pains,</l>
<l>And are determin'd to be hung in chains?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Goes your complaint to this?—that we display</l>
<l>A tale unsuited to the modern day?</l>
<l>Does this fam'd Island then produce no more</l>
<l>The bright atchievements of the days of yore?</l>
<l>Avert the thought!—still ancient Glory tow'rs,</l>
<l>And warm heroic Virtue still is ours!</l>
<l>Ev'n here, as I the martial theme pursue,</l>
<l>Full many a mother rises to my view,</l>
<l>Whose ardent Sons domestic comforts fly,</l>
<l>To seek th' advancing Foe with kindling eye,</l>
<l><pb n="68" facs="76"/>And, braving the full force of hostile pow'r,</l>
<l>Add to their Country's wreath another flow'r.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>No station, titles, here exemption claim;</l>
<l>All feel alike tbe sympathetic flame:</l>
<l>E'en <hi>SHE</hi> whose life adds splendour to a Throne,</l>
<l>Whom ev'ry British heart delights to own—</l>
<l>E'en <hi>SHE</hi> beholds her brave undaunted <hi>SON,</hi></l>
<l>In early youth the path of danger run!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Happy the realm, in this convulsive Age,</l>
<l>Whose tragic scenes are only on the Stage!</l>
<l>Calamity extends her wither'd hand,</l>
<l>And drags her harrow o'er a neighb'ring Land;</l>
<l>While you, reclin'd beneath a softer sway,</l>
<l>Bask and enjoy a bright unclouded day.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Depress'd by civic storms, deform'd with woes,</l>
<l>Stung by the pangs of agonizing throes,</l>
<l>A Nation falls.—'Tis yours to still the storm,</l>
<l>To raise with gen'rous arm her bleeding form,</l>
<l>To soothe her shame, administer relief,</l>
<l>To close the gushing artery of grief,</l>
<l>To cast a veil o'er each disgraceful seam,</l>
<l>And once more lift her to her own esteem.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>This Godlike act, which is reserv'd for you,</l>
<l>With glowing zeal and confidence pursue:</l>
<l>This act from future times shall homage claim,</l>
<l>Extend your worth, and consecrate your fame!</l>
