<p>ALL IN THE WRONG.</p>
<p>A COMEDY.</p>
<p>As it is Acted at the THEATRE-ROYAL in DRURY-LANE.</p>
<p>By Mr. MURPHY.</p>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THE first hint of this Comedy was suggested by the <hi>Cocu Imaginaire</hi> of <hi>Moliere,</hi> who took the idea of his piece from an Italian writer. Though jealousy, in all its appearances, has been frequently exhibited on the English stage, yet it was imagined that a plan, which should delineate all the varieties of that passion, whether subsisting between lovers or in the matrimonial life, and blend them together in one piece, would not be unacceptable to the public. If therefore there is atonement made for the want of originality of character by the decency of the dialogue, the novelty of the fable, and the complication of the incidents, the author has compassed all that he proposed to himself in the ensuing scenes; which, with pleasure he finds, were the occasion of producing the too long concealed powers of Miss <hi>Haughton,</hi> and of shewing, in a distinguished light, the exquisite acting of Mr. <hi>Obrien.</hi></p>

<head>SCENE <stage><hi>the Park.</hi></stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter Sir</hi> JOHN RESTLESS <hi>and</hi> ROBERT, <hi>from a House in the Side Scene.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR John Restless!—Sir John Restless! thou hast play'd the fool with a vengeance.—What devil whispered thee to marry such a woman?—Robert,—you have been a faithful servant in my family, Robert, and I value you.—Did your lady go out at this door here into the park, or did she go out at the street door?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>This door, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Robert, I will never live in a house again that has two doors to it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>I will give warning to my landlord instantly.—The eyes of Argus are not sufficient to watch the motions of a wife, where there is a street door, and a back door, to favour her escapes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word, Sir, I wish—you will pardon my boldness, Sir,—I wish you would shake off this uneasiness that preys upon your spirits—It grieves me to the heart,—it does, indeed, Sir, to see you in this way—Banish your suspicions, Sir—you have conceived some strange aversion, I am afraid, to my lady, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>No, Robert; no aversion—in spite of me I doat upon her still—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>Then why will you not think generously, Sir, of the person you love?—my lady, I dare be sworn—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Is false to me.—That embitters my whole life—I love her, and she repays me with ingratitude, with perfidy,—with falsehood,—with—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>I dare be sworn, Sir, she is a woman of honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Robert, I have considered you as a friend in my house—Don't you betray me too—Don't justify her—don't—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>Dear Sir, if you will but give me leave—you have been an indulgent master to me, and I am only concerned for your welfare—You married my lady for love, and I have heard you so warm in her praise—why will you go back from those sentiments?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I married her for love—Oh! love! love!—What mischief dost thou not occasion in this world?—Yes, Robert; I married her for love.—When first I saw her I was not so much struck with her beauty, as with that air of an ingenuous mind that appeared in her countenance;—her features did not so much charm me with their symmetry, as that expression of sweetness, that smile that indicated affability, modesty, and compliance.—But, honest Robert, I was deceived—I was not a month married, when I saw her practising those very smiles at her glass—I saw thro' the artifice; plainly saw there was nothing natural in her manner, but all forced, all studied, put on with her head-dress—I was alarmed; I resolved to watch her from that moment, and I have seen such things—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word, Sir, I believe you wrong her, and wrong yourself—you build on groundless surmizes;—you make yourself unhappy, and my lady too; and by being constantly uneasy, and never shewing her the least love,—you'll forgive me, Sir,—you sill her mind with strange suspicions, and so—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Suspicions, Robert!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir; strange suspicions!—My lady finds herself treated with no degree of tenderness; she infers that, your inclinations are fixed elsewhere, and so she is become—you will pardon my blunt honesty—she is become downright jealous,—as jealous as yourself, Sir.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Robert, you are little read in the arts of women; you little know the intricacies of their conduct; the mazes thro' which they walk, shifting, turning, winding, running into devious paths, but tending all thro' a labyrinth
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>to the temple of Venus;—you cannot see, Robert, that all her pretences to suspect me of infidelity are merely a counter-plot to cover her own loose designs;—'tis but a gauze-covering, tho'—it is seen thro' and only serves to shew her guilt the more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word, Sir John, I cannot see—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>No, Robert; I know you can't—her suspicions of me all make against her; they are but female stratagems, and yet it is but too true that she still is near my heart.—Oh! Robert, Robert, when I have watched her at a play, or elsewhere,—when I have counted her oglings, and her whisperings, her stolen glances, and her artful leer, with the cunning of her sex, she has pretended to be as watchful of me—Dissembling, false, deceitful woman!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>And yet, I dare assure you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>No more; I am not to be deceived; I know her thoroughly, and now,—now—has not she escaped out of my house, even now?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>But with no bad design.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>I am the best judge of that—which way did she go?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>Across the Park, Sir—that way, Sir—towards the Horse-guards—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Towards the Horse-guards!—there,—there,—there—the thing is evident;—you may go in, Robert.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir, I—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Go in, I say; go in—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>There is no persuading him to his own good</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<stage>Sir JOHN <hi>alone.</hi></stage>
<p>Gone towards the Horse-guards!—my head aches,—my forehead burns—I am cutting my
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>horns—Gone towards the Horse-Guards!—I'll pursue her thither; if I find her, her usual artifice will fail her—the time, the place, will all inform against her.—Sir John! Sir John! you were a madman to marry such a woman.—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> BEVERLEY <hi>and</hi> BELLMONT, <hi>at opposite Sides.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Ha! my dear Bellmont—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Beverley!—I rejoice to see you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Well! I suppose the same cause has brought us both into the Park; both come to sigh amorous vows in the friendly gloom of yonder walk;—Belinda keeps a perpetual war of love and grief, and hope and fear in my heart—and let me see— <stage>(<hi>lays his hand on Bellmont's breast</hi>)</stage> how fares all here? I fancy my sister is a little busy here—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Busy!—she makes a perfect riot there—not one wink the whole night—Oh! Clarissa, Clarissa! her form so animated! her eyes so—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Prithee! truce; I have not leisure to attend to her praise—a sister's praise too!—Faith, the greatest merit I ever could see in Clarissa is, that she loves you freely and sincerely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>And to be even with you, Sir,—your Belinda, upon my soul, notwithstanding all your lavish praises, her highest perfection, in my mind, is her sensibility to the merit of my friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Bellmont, don't talk prophanely—Such a girl!
<l>Scarce can I to heav'n excuse</l>
<l>The devotion which I use</l>
<l>Unto that adored dame;</l>
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>But, my dear Bellmont, tell me honestly now, do you think she has ever betrayed the least regard for me?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>How can you, Beverley, you that have such convincing proofs, how can you ask such a question—that uneasiness of yours, that inquietude of mind—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Prithee now don't fix that character upon me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>It is your character, my dear Beverley: and instead of enjoying the object before you, you are ever looking back to something past, or conjecturing about something to come, and are your own self-tormentor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>No, no, no; don't say so; I hate the very notion of such a temper: the thing is, when a man loves tenderly as I do, sollicitude and anxiety are natural; and when Belinda's father opposes my warmest wishes—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Why yes, the good Mr. Blandford is willing to give her in marriage to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>The senseless old dotard!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Thank you for the compliment!—and my father, the wise Sir William Bellmont—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Is a tyrannical, positive, headstrong—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>There again I thank you—But in short, the old couple, Belinda's father and mine, have both agreed upon the match, and they insist upon compliance from their children; so that, according to them, I am to be married off-hand to your mistress, and you and your sister, poor Clarissa, are to be left to shift for yourselves.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Racks and torment!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Racks and torment!—Seas of milk and ships of amber, man!—we are sailing to our
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>wished for harbour, in spite of their machinations.—I have settled the whole affair with Clarissa.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Have you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>I have, and to-morrow morning makes me possessor of her charms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>My dear boy, give us your hand;—and then, thou dear rogue, and then Belinda's mine— <stage>(<hi>sings</hi>) <hi>Loll-toll-loll</hi>—</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Well may you be in raptures, Sir; for here, here, here they both come—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> BELINDA, and CLARISSA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<l>Grace was in all her steps; heav'n in her eye;</l>
<l>In every gesture, dignity and love.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>A poetical reception truly!—But can't your passion inspire you to a composition of your own Mr. Beverley?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>It inspires me with sentiments, Madam, which I can't find words to express.—Sucklin, Waller, Landsdown, and all our dealers in loveverses, give but a faint image of a heart touched like mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Poor Gentleman! what a terrible taking you are in! But if the sonneteers cannot give an image of you, Sir, have you had recourse to a painter, as you promised me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I have Belinda, and here,—here is the humble portrait of your adorer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<stage>(<hi>Takes the picture.</hi>)</stage>
<p>Well! there is a likeness—but after all, there is a better painter than this gentleman, whoever he be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>A better!—now she is discontented <stage>(<hi>aside</hi>)</stage> where, Madam, can a better be found?—if money can purchase him—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="11"/>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Sir, when he draws for money he never succeeds—But when pure inclination prompts him, then his colouring is warm indeed—He gives a portrait that endears the original.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Such an artist is worth the Indies.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>You need not go so far to seek him—he has done your business already—The limner I mean is a certain little blind god, called Love, and he has stamped such an impression of you here—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Madam, your most obedient,—and I can tell you, that the very same gentleman has been at work for you too.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p><stage>(<hi>who had been talking apart with Clarissa.</hi>)</stage> Oh! he has had a world of business upon his hands, for we two have been agreeing what havock he has made with us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but we are but in a kind of fool's paradise here; all our schemes are but mere castle-building, which your father, Mr. Bellmont,—and my dear Belinda,—yours too are most obstinately determined to destroy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Why as you say, they are determined that I shall have the honour of Belinda's hand in the country-dance of matrimony.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Without considering that I may like another partner better—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>And without considering that I, forlorn as I am, and my sister, there—who is as well inclined to a matrimonial game of romps as any girl in Christendom, must both of us sit down, and lead apes in hell, in spite of our strongest inclinations to mingle in the groupe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>But we have planned our own happiness, and with a little resolution we shall be successful
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>in the end I warrant ye.—Clarissa, my angel, let us take a turn this way, and leave that love-sick pair to themselves—they are only fit company for each other, and we can find wherewithal to entertain ourselves.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<p>Ay! let us turn this way.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>What are you going to leave us, Clarissa?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<p>Only just sauntering into this sidewalk—we sha'nt lose one another.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIND.</speaker>
<p>Oh! you are such a tender couple—you are not tired I see of saying pretty soft things to each other.—Well! well!—take your own way.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<p>And if I guess right, you are glad to be left together—Belinda.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Who I?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<p>You, my dear—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Not I truly—let us walk together.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<p>No, no, by no means—you shall be indulged—adieu!—we shall be within call.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exeunt</hi> Bellmont and Clarissa.</stage>
<stage>BELINDA, BEVERLEY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>My sister is frankly in love with Bellmont—I wish Belinda would act as openly towards me—I wish she has not a lurking inclination for Bellmont. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir!—Thoughtful!—Oh! I'll call Mr. Bellmont back, if that is the case.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>She will call Mr. Bellmont back. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir; am I to entertain you, or you me?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Madam!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Madam!—ha! ha! why you look as
<pb n="10" facs="13"/>if you were frightened—are you afraid of being left alone with me?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Belinda, you know that is the happiness of my life;—but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>But what, Sir?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I am afraid I have done something to offend you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>To offend me!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Belinda; I should have been of the party last night; I own I should; it was a sufficient inducement for me that you was to be there; it was my fault, and you I see are piqued at it.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>I piqued!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I see you are; and you was so last night too—I have heard it all, and in mere resentment you directed all your discourse to Mr. Bellmont.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>If I did, it was merely accidental.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>No, it was deliberately done;—forgive my rash folly in refusing the invitation—I meant no manner of harm—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Who imagines you did, Sir?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I beg your pardon, Belinda, you take offence too lightly—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! what have you taken into your head now?—this uneasiness is of your own making—I have taken nothing ill, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>You could not but take it ill; but by all that's amiable about you, I meant not to incur your displeasure—forgive that abrupt answer I sent—I should have made a handsomer apology.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Apology!—what occasion was there for any thing more?—you said you was pre-engaged, did not you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="14"/>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I said so; I own it, and beg your pardon—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Beg my pardon! for what? ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I only meant—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! can you think I see any thing in your message to be offended at, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Where you were concerned, I own I should have expressed myself with more delicacy, than those hasty words, I am engaged, and can't wait upon you to-night. I should have told you that my heart was with you, though necessity dragged me another way—but this omission you resented—I could learn, since, the spirits you were in the whole evening, though I enjoyed nothing in your absence—I could hear the sallies of your wit, the sprightliness of your conversation, and on whom your eyes were fixed the whole night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>They were fixed upon Mr. Bellmont, you think!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Ay! and fixed with delight upon him; seemed negociating the business of love before the whole company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word, Sir, whoever is your author, he has misinformed you; and let me tell you, you alarm me with these fancies, and you know I have often told you that you are of too refining a temper—you create for yourself imaginary misunderstandings, and then are ever entering into explanations—I assure you, Mr. Beverley, this watching for intelligence, from the spies and misrepresenters of conversation, betrays the symptoms of jealousy, and I would not be married to a jealous man for the world.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Now she is seeking occasion to break off.— <stage>(<hi>aside.</hi>)</stage> Jealousy, Ma'am, can never get admission into my breast, I am of too generous
<pb n="12" facs="15"/>a temper; a certain delicacy I own I have; I value the opinion of my friends, and when there are circumstances of a doubtful aspect, I am glad to set things in their true light;—and surely, Belinda, if I do so with others, surely with you on whom my happiness depends to desire a favourable interpretation of my words and actions—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>But these little humours may grow up, and gather into the fixed disease of jealousy at last.— <stage>(<hi>Lady Restless crosses the stage, and rings a bell at the door.</hi>)</stage> And there now,—there goes a lady who is a victim to her own fretful imagination—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Who is the lady pray?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>My lady Restless;—walk this way, and I will give you her whole character—I am not acquainted with her ladyship, but I have heard much of her—this way—this way—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt Belinda and Beverley.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Lady</hi> RESTLESS</speaker>
<stage>(<hi>ringing at the door.</hi>)</stage>
<p>What do these servants mean?—there is something going forward here—I will be let in or I will know the reason why— <stage>(<hi>rings again</hi>)</stage> but in the mean time, Sir John can let any body he pleases out at the street-door—I'll run up the steps here, and observe.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<stage>TATTLE <hi>opens the door,</hi> MARMALET <hi>follows her.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>TATTLE.</speaker>
<p>Who rung this bell?—I don't see any body—and yet I am sure the bell rung.—Well, Mrs. Marmalet, you will be going, I see.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="16"/>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Mrs. Tattle; I must be going; I'll run across the Park, and I shall soon get to Grosvenor-Square—when shall I see you at our house?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAT.</speaker>
<p>Oh! the Lord knows when I shall be able to get out—my lady leads us all such lives—Oh! I wish I had such another place as you have of it.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>Heaven be praised! I have nothing to complain of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAT.</speaker>
<p>No, that you have not: Lord! when shall I get such a gown as that you have on by my lady—She will never fling off such a thing, and give it to a poor servant.—Worry, worry, worry herself, and every body else too—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Re-enter Lady</hi> RESTLESS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>No; there is nobody stirring that way—what do I see?—a hussy coming out of my house!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>Well, I must be gone, Mrs. Tattle—fare you well—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>She is dizoned out too! Madam is! why did not you open the door, Tattle, when I rung?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAT.</speaker>
<p>I came as soon as possible, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Who have you with you here?—what is your business, mistress?</p>
</sp>
<stage>to Marmalet.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>My business, madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>In confusion too!—the case is plain—you come here after Sir John, I suppose—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>I come after Sir John, madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Guilt in her face! yes, after Sir John; and Tattle, you are in the plot against me; you were favouring her escape, were you?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="17"/>
<speaker>TAT.</speaker>
<p>I favour her escape, madam!—there is no occasion for that.—This is Mrs. Marmalet, madam, an acquaintance of mine, madam, that is come to see me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Oh! very fine, mistress! you bring your creatures after the vile man, do you?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>I assure you, madam, I am a very honest girl—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I dare say so—where did you get that gown?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>La! ma'am!—I came by it honestly—my lady Conquest gave it to me—I live with my lady Conquest, madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>What a complexion she has!—how long have you lived in London?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>Three years, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>In London three years with that complexion! it can't be—but perhaps she is painted—all these creatures paint—you are all so many painted dolls <stage>(<hi>rubs her face with a white handkerchief</hi>)</stage> no—it does not come off—so, Mrs. Tattle, you bring your fresh country girls here to my house, do you?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAT.</speaker>
<p>Upon my credit, ma'am—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Don't tell me—I see thro' this affair—Go you about your business, mistress, and let me never see you about my doors again—go—go—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<p>Lord, ma'am, I shan't trouble your house—Mrs. Tattle, a good day—here's a deal to do, indeed—I have as good a house as her's to go to—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>There, there, there;—see there;—she goes off in a huff! the way with them all—ay! I see how it is, Tattle,—you false, ungrateful—that
<pb n="15" facs="18"/>gown was never given her by a woman—she had that from Sir John.—Where is Sir John?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAT.</speaker>
<p>Sir John an't at home, ma'am?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Where is he?—where is he gone?—when did he go out?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAT.</speaker>
<p>I really don't know, ma'am—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Tattle, I know you fib now—But I'll sift this to the bottom.—I'll write to my lady Conquest to know the truth about that girl that was here but now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAT.</speaker>
<p>You will find I told you truth, madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Very well, Mrs. Pert,—I'll go and write this moment,—send Robert to me to give me an account of his master—Sir John, Sir John, you will distract me—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt.</stage>
<stage><hi>Re-enter</hi> BELINDA <hi>and</hi> BEVERLEY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Ay! but that quickness, and that extreme sensibility is what I am afraid of.—I positively would not have a jealous husband for the world—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>By heaven! no earthly circumstance shall ever make me think injuriously of you.—Jealousy!—ha! ha!—it is the most ridiculous passion—ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>You may laugh, Sir; but I know your over-refining temper too well, and I absolutely will have it in our marriage-articles, that I must not be plagued with your suspicions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I subscribe, ma'am—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>I will have no enquiries where I am going to visit; no following me from place to place; and if we should chance to meet, and you should perceive a man of wit, or a pretty fellow,
<pb n="16" facs="19"/>speaking to me, I will not have you fidgetting about on your chair, knitting your brow, and looking at your watch—My dear, is it not time to go home?—my love, the coach is waiting:—and then, if you are prevailed upon to stay, I will not have you converse with a "yes, Sir," and a "no, Sir," for the rest of the evening, and then wrangle with me in the chariot all the way home, and not be commonly civil to me for the rest of the night—I positively will have none of this—.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Agreed, ma'am, agreed—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>And then you shan't tell me you are going out of town, and then sneak in privately to the play, or to Ranelagh, merely to be a spy upon me—and I positively will admit no curiosity about my letters—if you were to open a letter of mine, I should never forgive you—I do verily believe, if you were to open my letters I should hate you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I subscribe to every thing you can ask—you shall have what female friends you please; loose your money to whom you please; dance with what beau you please; ride out with whom you please; go to what china shop you please; and, in short, do what you please, without my attempting to bribe your footman, or your maid to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! lud! Oh! lud! that is in the very strain of jealousy—Heaven deliver me!—there is my father yonder, and Sir William Bellmont with him—Fly—this instant, fly, Mr. Beverley, down that walk—any where—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>You promise then—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Don't talk to me now—what would you be at?—I am yours, and only yours; unalterably
<pb n="17" facs="20"/>so—Fly—Mr. Beverley, be gone, and leave me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I obey, madam—I am gone.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BELINDA.</speaker>
<p>Now are they putting their wise heads together to thwart all my schemes of happiness—but love, imperious love, will have it otherwise—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Mr.</hi> BLANDFORD, <hi>and Sir</hi> WILLIAM.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Sir William, since we have agreed upon every thing—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>Why yes, Mr. Blandford, I think every thing is settled—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Why then we have only to acquaint the young people with our intentions, and so conclude the affair—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>That is all, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. BLAND.</speaker>
<p>As to my girl, I don't mind her nonsense about Beverley—she must do as I will have her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>And my son too, he must follow my directions.—As to his telling me of his love for Clarissa, it is all a joke to me—Children must do as their parents will have them.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Ay! ay! so they must; and so they shall—hey! here is my daughter—So Belinda!—well, my girl, Sir William and I have agreed, and so you are to prepare for marriage, that's all—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Marriage with Mr. Beverley, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Beverley!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>You know you encouraged him yourself, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Well, well! I have changed my mind on that head—my friend, Sir William, here offers
<pb n="18" facs="21"/>you his son—do as I would have you—have a care, Belinda—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>But, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>But, madam, I will be obeyed—You don't like him, you say—but I like him—and that's sufficient for you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>And so it is, Mr. Blandford;—if my son pretended to have a will of his own, I should let him know to the contrary—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>And can you, Sir William, against our inclination force us both?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Hold your tongue, Belinda; don't provoke me—What makes you from home?—go your ways back to Queen's-Square directly, and settle your mind; for I tell you once for all I will have my own way.—Come, Sir William, we will step to the lawyer's chambers.—Go home, Belinda, and be observant of my commands.—Come along, Sir William—what did you say?—you mutiny, do you?—don't provoke me—You know, Belinda, I am an odd sort of a man when provok'd—Look ye here—mind what I say; I won't reason with you about the matter; my power is absolute, and if you offer to rebel, you shall have no husband at all with my consent—I'll cut you off with a shilling; I'll see you starve—beg an alms—live miserable—die wretched—in short, suffer any calamity without the least compassion from me—if I should find you an undutiful girl at last—so there's one word for all—</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>What will become of me?—his inhumanity overcomes me quite—I can never consent—the very sight of this picture is enough to forbid it—Oh! Beverley,—you are the master

<p>Somewhat better, Tattle—reach that chair—Tattle, tell me honestly, does that girl live with Lady Conquest?</p>

<speaker>TAT.</speaker>
<p>You will hear nothing, Ma'am, but what I have told you already.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Tattle, Tattle, I took you up in the country in hopes gratitude would make you my friend—but you are as bad as the rest of them—conceal all you know, do;—it is of very little consequence—I now see through the whole affair—though it is the picture of a man—yet I am not to be deceived—I understand it all.—This is some former gallant—the creature gave this to Sir John, as a proof that she had no affection for any but himself.—What art he must have had to induce her to this!—I have found him out at last—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Sir</hi> JOHN (<hi>peeping in.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>What does she say?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>I have seen enough to convince me what a man he is—the fate of us poor women is hard—we all wish for husbands, and they are the torments of our lives.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TAT.</speaker>
<p>There is too much truth in what you say, ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>You join her, do you, Mrs. Iniquity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>What a pity it is, Tattle, that poor women should be under severer restraints than the men are!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>You repine for want of freedom, do you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Cruel laws of wedlock!—The tyrant-husband may triumph in his infidelity,
<pb n="23" facs="26"/>may securely trample upon all laws of decency and order, and it redounds to his credit—gives him a fashionable air of vice, while a poor woman is obliged to submit to his cruelty—and remains tied to him for life—even though she has reason to entertain a mortal hatred for him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! very well argued, madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>What a pity it is, Tattle, that we cannot change our husbands, as we do our ear-rings or our gloves!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>There is a woman of spirit!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Tattle! will you own the truth to me about that girl?—</p>

</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Now, madam, now false one, have I caught you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>You are come home at last, I find, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>My lady Restless, my lady Restless, what can you say for yourself now?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>What can I say for myself, Sir John!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Ay! Madam! this picture—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, that picture.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Will be an evidence—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Of your shame Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Of my shame!—'tis very true what she says;—yes, madam, it will be an evidence of my shame; I feel that but too sensibly;—but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>You own it then, do you?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Own it! I must own it, madam; though confusion cover me, I must own it;—it is what you have deserved at my hands—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>I deserve it, Sir John!—but find excuses if you will—cruel, cruel man!—to make
<pb n="25" facs="28"/>me this return at last—I cannot bear it—Oh! oh! <stage>(<hi>Cries.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! you may weep; but your tears are lost; they will fall without effect.—I now renounce you for ever—this picture will justify me to the wide world; it will shew what a base woman you have been.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>What does the man mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>The picture of your gallant, madam!—the darling of your amorous hours,—who gratifies your luxurious appetites abroad, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Scurrilous wretch! Oh! Sir, you are at your old stratagem I find,—recrimination, you think, will serve your turn.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>It is a pity you know, madam, that a woman should be tied to a man for life, even though she has a mortal hatred for him.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Artful hypocrite!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>That she can't change her husband as she does her ear-rings or her gloves.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Po! Sir John, this is your old device, this won't avail you.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Had the original of this fallen to your lot, you could kiss the picture for ever.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Sir John.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>You can gloat upon it, madam, glue your very lips to it.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Shallow artifice!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>With him you could be for ever happy.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>This is all in vain, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Had such a dear, dear man fallen to your lot, instead of the brute, the monster—Am I a monster?—I am,—and you have made me so—the world shall know your infamy.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="26" facs="29"/>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Oh! brave it out, Sir, brave it out to the last—harmless, innocent man!—you have nothing to blush for, nothing to be ashamed of—you have no intrigues, no private amours abroad—I have not seen any thing, not I—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I have seen, and I now see your paramour.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Oh! that air of confidence will be of great use to you, Sir—for you have no convenient to meet you under my very window, to loll softly in your arms—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Hey! how!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Her arm thrown carelessly round your neck—your hand tenderly applied to her cheek.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>S'death! that's unlucky—she will turn it against me. <stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Oh! you are in confusion, are you, Sir?—but why should you? you meant no harm—You are safe with me, my dear—will you step into my house, my love?—yes, Sir, you would fain bring her into my very house—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>My Lady Restless, this evasion is mean and paultry—you beheld a young lady in distress.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I know it, Sir,—and you, tender-hearted man, could caress her out of meer compassion;—gaze wantonly on her out of charity, and, out of pure benevolence of disposition, convey her to some convenient dwelling—Oh! Sir John, Sir John—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Madam, this well-acted passion—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Don't imagine she has escaped me, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! you may talk and rave, ma'am; but depend upon it, I shall spare no pains to do
<pb n="27" facs="30"/>myself justice on this occasion—nor will I rest till—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Oh! fie upon you, Sir John; these artifices—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN</speaker>
<p>Nor will I rest, madam, until I have found, by means of this instrument here in my hand, who your darling is—I will go about streight—ungrateful, treacherous woman!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Yes, go now, under that pretext, in pursuit of your licentious pleasures.—This ever has been his scheme to cloak his wicked practices—abandoned man!—To face me down too, after what my eyes so plainly beheld—I wish I could wring that secret out of Tattle—I'll step to my own room directly, and try by menaces, by wheedling, by fair means, by foul means, by every means, to wrest it from her.</p>

<p>Madam,<lb/>
My lady Conquest being gone into the country for a few days, I have judged it proper to send a speedy answer to yours, and to assure you, for your peace of mind, that you need not entertain the least suspicion of Marmalet, my lady's woman. She has lived some years in our family, and I know her by experience to be an honest trusty girl, and one that would not make mischief between your ladyship and Sir John.<lb/>
I have the honour to be, Madam, your very humble servant,<lb/>
CONQUEST.</p>
<p><pb n="30" facs="33"/>
So! so! so!—Marmalet is a trusty girl!—one that will not make mischief between man and wife!—that is to say, now that she will discover nothing against my lady Restless!—for her peace of mind he lets madam know all this too!—she may go on boldly now; for my lady Conquest is gone into the country, Marmalet is trusty, and my lord has given her the most speedy notice—Very well! very well!—proofs thicken upon proofs—Shall I go directly and challenge his lordship?—no—no—that won't do—Watch him closely, that will do better—If I could have a word in private with the maid—Robert,—Robert—come hither—step to my lord Conquest's—but with caution proceed—Enquire there for Marmalet, the maid.</p>

<p>She visits our Tattle, Sir.</p>

<p>Visits our Tattle!—it is a plain case— <stage>(<hi>aside</hi>)</stage>—Enquire for that girl—but with caution, tho'—and tell her to meet me privately—unknown to any body—in the dusk of the evening—down in the Bird-Cage walk, yonder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>I will, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>And don't let Tattle see her—Tattle has engaged her in her mistress's interest—I see how it is—don't let any of my servants see her—go directly, Robert. Now shall I judge what regard you have for me—But, hark ye, Robert!—Come hither! a word with you—should it be known that this girl converses with me—should my lady have the least item of it, they are then upon their guard—You must be cautious, therefore—let her come wrapped up in darkness—concealed from every observer with a mask on—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="34"/>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>A mask, Sir John—won't that make her be remark'd the more?—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Yes, they had almost surpriz'd us—but at sight of her father, Belinda gave me the word, and away I darted down towards the canal, yonder—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Was Sir William with him then?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Yes; they had been plotting our destruction together—But we shall out-officer them, it is to be hoped, my boy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and it is also to be feared that we shall not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Hey! you alarm me—no new mine sprung!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>No, nothing new; but the old story—The old folks are determined;—at the turning of yonder corner they came both full tilt upon Clarissa, and me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Well, and how! what passed?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Why they were scarcely civil to your sister. Sir William fixed his surly eye upon me for a time, then calling me to him, Sir, says he, you will run counter to my will, I see—you will be ever dangling after that girl—But, Mr. Blandford and I have agreed upon the match,—and then he peremptorily commanded me to take my leave of her that moment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="32" facs="35"/>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>And did you so?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>And did you so?—how can you ask such a question? Sir, says I, I must see the lady home, and so off I marched, arm in arm, with her, my father bawling after me, and I bowing to him, Sir, your humble servant, I wish you a good morning, Sir.—He continued calling out,—I kissed my hand to him,—and so we made our escape.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>And where have you left her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>At home; at your house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Well! and do ye both continue in the same mind; is to-morrow to be your weddingday?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Now are you conjuring up a thousand horrid fancies to torment yourself with—But don't be alarmed, my dear Beverley—I shall leave you your Belinda, and content myself with the honour of being your brother-in-law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Sir, the honour will be to me—But uneasy!—ha! ha!—no—no—I am not uneasy, nor shall I ever be so again—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>I wish you would keep that resolution—where do you dine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Will you dine with me?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>I can't; 'tis club-day—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Faith, so it is—I'll attend you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>That's right; let us turn towards the Mall, and saunter there till dinner—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>No, I can't go that way yet—I must enquire how Belinda does, and what her father said to her; for I have not seen her since we parted in the morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>And now, according to custom, you will make her an apology for leaving her, when there was an absolute necessity for it, and you'll
<pb n="33" facs="36"/>fall to an explanation of circumstances that require no explanation at all, and refine upon things, and—</p>

<p>An odd adventure this, Bellmont.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Very odd, indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Do you find any likeness, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Your head a little more that way, if you please—ay! ay! it is he—'tis a plain case; this is my man, or rather,—this is my wife's man—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Did you ever know any thing like this?—ha! ha!</p>

<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>They are both laughing at me—ay! and I shall be laught at by the whole town, pointed at, hooted at, and gazed at—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>What do I see?—s'death, the setting of that picture is like what I gave Belinda.—Zoons! if it is the same—</p>

<stage>drawing near him.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>He makes his approach,—and means, I suppose, to snatch it out of my hand—But I'll be before-hand with him,—and so into my pocket it goes—There, lie safe there—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Zoons! he puts it up in a hurry—will you be so good, Sir, as to favour me with a—</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>The picture, Sir—Po!—a mere daub—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Mere curiosity, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>It is not worth your seeing—I wish you a good day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I should take it as a favour—</p>

<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I have reason to be uneasy—she slights me, disdains me,—treats me with contempt—</p>
</sp>

<p>No, Sir; I shan't dine at all—I am not well—</p>

<p>Ridiculous! how can you be so absurd?—I'll bett you twenty pounds that is not your picture—</p>

<p>Done; I take it—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart; and I'll tell you what, if it be yours, I will give you leave to be as jealous of her as you please—Come, now let us to dinner—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I attend you—in the evening we shall know the truth—if it be that I gave Belinda—she is false, and I am miserable.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>BELINDA.</speaker>
<p>BUT have you really fixed every thing, Clarissa?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>Positively, and to-morrow morning makes me his.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>To-morrow morning!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>Yes, to-morrow morning I release Mr. Bellmont from his fetters, and resign my person to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Why, that is what all we poor women, after all the victories of our charms, all the triumphs of our beauty, and all the murders of our eyes, must come to at last.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>Well, and in that we but imitate the men. Don't we read of them conquering whole kingdoms, and then submitting at last to be governed by the vanquished.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Very true, Clarissa; and upon my word I think you are a heroine equal in fame to any of them; nay superior, for your scheme, I take it, is not to unpeople the world—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>Prithee, Belinda, don't talk so wildly; for, to tell you the truth, now that I have settled the affair, I begin to be alarmed at what I have done.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! dear, dear affectation!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="39" facs="42"/>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>Actually now, positively, I am terrified to death.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha!—to be sure—our sex must play its tricks, and summon up all its fantastic train of doubts and fears—but courage, my dear, don't be frightened, for the same sex within that heart of yours will urge you on, and never let you be at rest, till you have procured yourself a tyrant for life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>A tyrant, Belinda! I think more generously of Mr. Bellmont, than to imagine he will usurp to himself an ill use of his power—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>To deal candidly with you, I am of your opinion—but, tell me now, a'n't I a very good girl, to resign such a man to you?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>Why, indeed, I must confess the obligation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Ay! but to resign him for one, whose temper does not promise I shall live under so mild a government.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>How do you mean?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Why, Mr. Beverley's strange caprices, suspicions, and unaccountable whimsies, are enough to alarm one upon the brink of matrimony.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>Well, I vow I can't help thinking, Belinda, that you are a little subject to vain surmises and suspicions yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Come now, you are an insincere girl; you know I am of a temper too generous, too open—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>I grant all that, but by this constant repetition of the same doubts, I should not wonder to see you most heartily jealous of him—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Jealous!—oh heavens!—jealous indeed!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="40" facs="43"/>

<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Well, upon my soul, Beverley, you make me laugh at you—but come, there's an end of that matter—Ladies your most obedient—I hope we have not transgressed our time.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Not in the least; you are both very exact—true as the dial to the sun.—</p>

<p><stage>(<hi>In a peevish manner.</hi>)</stage> Although it be not shone upon.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Oh! lord! you two are going to commence wrangling lovers again—a-propos, Belinda—now Beverley, you shall see—be so good, ma'am, as to let me see this gentleman's picture.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>His picture! what can you want it for?—you shall have it— <stage>(<hi>searching her pocket.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Now, Beverley, do you confess how wrong you have been?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Why faith I begin to think I was wrong—say not a word to her—she'll never forgive me else. <stage>(<hi>Apart.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>

<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>It is not in that pocket—it must be here— <stage>(<hi>searches the other.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>You have been sad company, on account of this strange suspicion.</p>

<p>I own it; let it drop; say no more.—</p>
</sp>
<stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Well! I protest and vow—what can

</sp>
<sp>

<p>No, ma'am, it is no trick of ours— <stage>(<hi>angrily.</hi>)</stage></p>

<p>What think you now, Bellmont?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>She'll find it presently, man; don't shew your humours, be upon your guard; you'll undo yourself else—Clarissa, shall you and I saunter down this walk?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>My brother seems out of humour,—what's the matter?</p>

<p>Well, I declare upon my honour I don't know what is come of this odious picture—</p>

<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>This odious picture!—Oh! Belinda.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>You may look grave, Sir, but I have it not.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I know you have not, ma'am; and don't imagine—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Imagine! what do you mean?—imagine what?</p>

<p>To whom I gave it!—have a care, Sir; this is another symptom of your jealous temper.</p>

<p>Well, upon my word you are making yourself very ridiculous in this matter—ha! ha!—</p>

<p>You may laugh, madam, but it is no laughing matter, I assure you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! brave—follow your own notions—I gave it away—I have scorned your present—ha! ha!—poor Mr. Beverley!—</p>

<p>I don't doubt you, ma'am, I believe you did give it away.</p>

<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>And handsome?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>In the highest degree; my heart is devoted to her; and I have reason to suspect, that a present from me is not of so much value as I could wish.—To be plain, ma'am, I imagine she has given the picture away.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Look-ye there now!—my suspicions are just.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Your suspicions, madam!—did you suspect it was given to Sir John Restless?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>What I know of the matter shall be no secret to you—Pray, Sir, have you spoke to the lady on this head?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I have, but she knows nothing of the matter; she has lost it,—she has mislaid it,—she can give no account of it—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>She has given it to Sir John, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Given it to him?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Given it to him, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Then I have no further doubt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Of what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I would not hurt your peace of mind; I would not give you impressions of Sir John, that may—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Sir, stand upon no ceremony with him; an injurious, false, licentious man!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Is that his character?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Notoriously: he has made me miserable; false to his marriage vows, and warm in the pursuit of his pleasures abroad!—I have not deserved it of him—Oh! Sir John! Sir John! Oh!</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>She weeps; the case is plain, and I am undone—</p>

<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, what is the lady's name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Belinda Blandford.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Belinda Blandford!—I thank you, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Madam, have you ever seen her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Seen her, Sir!—yes, I have seen too much of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>You alarm me, madam—you have seen nothing unhandsome, I hope—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>I don't know what you call unhandsome, Sir.—But, pray, what ought one to think of a young lady thrown familiarly into a gentleman's arms?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>In his arms, madam!—Sir John's arms!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>In Sir John's!—in open day;—in the Park;—under my very window;—most familiarly, wantonly reclining in his very arms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Oh! heavens!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>He clasping her with equal freedom round the waist—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>False, false Belinda!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Both interchanging fond mutual glances—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Oh! madam, the whole is come to light, and I thank you for the discovery, tho' I am ruined by it—But give me leave—is all this certain?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>There can be no doubt, Sir, these eyes beheld their amorous meeting.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Saw it yourself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Yes, all, all, Sir—Sir John, I know, is capable of any thing, and you know what to think of Belinda, as you call her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="50" facs="53"/>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Oh! madam, I have long had reason to suspect.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>You have, Sir?—then the whole affair is plain enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>It is so—I meant an honourable connection with her;—but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>But you see, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I see, madam—you are sure Sir John has this picture?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Sure, Sir!—it is your own picture—I had it in my hands but a moment, and he flew with ardor, with impetuosity, like a fury flew to it, and recovered it from me—what could be the meaning of that, Sir?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>The meaning is too plain.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>And then, Sir, when charged and pressed home with his guilt, most hypocritically he pretended to believe it the portrait of some favourite of mine—But you know, Sir, how that is—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Oh! madam, I can justify you—ha! ha! that is but a poor evasion, and confirms me the more in my opinion—and I humbly take my leave—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I am glad you have had the good luck to speak to me about this affair;—and, if any other circumstances come to your knowledge, I shall take it as a favour if you will acquaint me with them—for, indeed, Sir, I am very unhappy—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I am in gratitude bound to you, and my best services, you shall ever command—Madam, your most obedient—Oh! Belinda! Belinda!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>

<p>Now, Sir John—how will you be able to confront these stubborn facts?—You

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>That, I suppose, you have heard from my good lady within here—</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, and I have heard a great deal more from my lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>I don't in the least doubt it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I do not mean to work myself up into any choler about such a trifling bauble—since the lady has thought proper to give it to you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Do her justice, pray; she did not give it; so far she was true to you—I took it from her, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>And that shews you are upon free and easy terms with her;—it is of no manner of consequence to me; I despise it, and you are welcome to make what use you will of it.—This, I will only say, that you have made me miserable.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>What, I have interrupted your happiness?</p>
</sp>

<p>You have.</p>

<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>And no doubt you think it cruel of me so to do.</p>

<p>Injury!—I promise you, Sir, I will never injure you again, and so you may set your mind at peace, for I here declare, I never will hold farther intercourse with her—</p>

<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! that is too late for me; I have now done with her myself—you are very welcome to the lady, Sir—you may take her home with you as soon as you please; I have done with her, I forswear her, and so I shall tell my lady this moment— <stage>(<hi>going.</hi>)</stage></p>

<p>Hey! which way is the wind now?—some quarrel, I suppose—but the falling out of lovers—must I take it away, Sir?—</p>

<p>Oh! Brush, she is—but I will not proclaim her shame—no, let me still be tender—I will see her no more, Brush, that is all; hear from her no more; she must not wind herself about my heart again—I'll go out of town directly—order my chaise to the door.</p>

<speaker>BRUSH.</speaker>
<p>But, Sir, you know that one solitary tear, which, after miserably chasing for it for half an hour together, she will painfully distil from
<pb n="61" facs="64"/>the corner of her eye, will extinguish all this rage, and then—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Po! po! you know nothing of the matter—go, and order the chaise directly—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRUSH.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir—I suppose a couple of shirts will be sufficient, Sir?—you will hardly stay them out—</p>

<p>Pack up all, Sir—I shall stay in the country a whole month, if it be necessary—</p>

<p>I am resolved, fixed, determined,—and so, do as I have ordered you.— <stage>(<hi>Exit Brush</hi>)</stage>—So shall I disentangle myself from her entirely—so shall I forget the fondness my foolish heart had for her—I hate her, loath her, pity her, am sorry for her, and love her still—I must expel this weakness from my mind—I will think no more of her—and yet—Brush! Brush!—I may as well see her letter too—only to try what her cunning can suggest.</p>

<p>I beg, Sir, you will have done—what, plead for treachery, for falshood, for deceit—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>No, Sir, but for my friend, my lovely friend, for Belinda, for truth, for innocence—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Po! po! you don't know all the circumstances—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>But we do know all the circumstances, and, my dear brother, you have behaved very ill.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Heaven knows, I have not, and yet, heaven knows, I should be glad to be convinced I have—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you what then, we women are soft and compassionate in our nature; go to her without delay, fall at her feet, beg her pardon, drop a tear or two, and all will be well again.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Prithee don't laugh at me,—may contempt and beggary attend me,—may all the calamities of life befal me,—may shame, confusion, and disquiet of heart for ever sting me,—if I hold farther intercourse with her; if I do not put her from my thoughts for ever.—Did you leave her at home?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>We did.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Well, let her slay there—it is of no consequence to me—how did she bear what passed between us?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>Like a sweet girl as she is; she behaved like an angel; I shall love her better than ever for her good humour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I don't doubt her good humour—she has smiles at command—let her smile or not smile, 'tis all alike to me—did she say any thing?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="64" facs="67"/>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>She told us the whole story, and told it in tears too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Ay! them she can command too!—But I have no curiosity about her—was she in tears tho'?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>She was, and wept bitterly—how could you, brother, behave so rashly to so amiable a girl?—have you a pleasure in being the cause of her uneasiness?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I the cause!—you wrong me—by heaven you wrong me—my lady Restless was the cause—she told me such things—she planted daggers in my very heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>You planted daggers in her heart—and it was barbarous.—What, because a lady has not strength enough to bear up against a father, who is resolved to give her away to another, and because she faints out of excessive tenderness for you, and in that distress meets accidental relief from Sir John Restless at his own door—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>How!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>And because my lady Restless sees this out of her window, and has a perverse talent of misinterpreting appearances into realities, to her own disadvantage—you must therefore fill your head with ungenerous suspicions—Oh! for shame, for shame, how could you?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>But, is all this true?—is this really the case?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>How can you doubt it, Beverley;—you know Belinda too well—it is the case, man.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I should be glad to find it so—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>Well! well! I tell you it is so—how could you think otherwise, when you know she has the best heart in the world, and is so nice of
<pb n="65" facs="68"/>honour, she scorns all falshood and dissimulation—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! my dear Beverley, you have done the absurdest thing—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Why, if what you say can be made to appear—but then she'll never forgive my past behaviour—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>Po! you talk as if you were wholly unletter'd in the tempers of women—my dear brother, you know, you men can do what you please with us, when you have got an interest in our hearts—go to her, I say, go to her, and make your peace—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>May I depend upon what you say?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>You may.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Then I'll fly to her this instant, humble myself to her, and promise by all my future life to attone for this brutal injury—</p>

<p>My dear sister, I am for ever obliged to you;—and Bellmont, I thank you too—how could I wrong her so?—I shall behold her once again—ha! ha!—is the chariot ready?—I won't stay for it; I am on the wing, my dear Belinda, to implore forgiveness—and so she fainted away
<pb n="66" facs="69"/>in the Park, and my lady Restless saw Sir John afford her relief?—ha! ha! ha!—whimsical enough—ha! ha! ha!—what a strange construction her crazy temper put upon it?—ha! ha!—how could the woman be so foolish?—my dear Belinda, I will fly to you this moment—ha! ha!— <stage>(<hi>going, returns</hi>)</stage> Sir John shall give me back the picture, and, on my knees, I will once more present it—</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>I knew it would be so—</p>
</sp>

<p>She shall have it—I'll find Sir John directly—and then—ha! ha! how could I be such a madman! ha! ha!—sister, your servant—Bellmont, yours—ha! ha! what a piece of work has that foolish woman made for us all—ha! ha!</p>

<p>Oh! my angel, you are all—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Oh lord! Oh lord!—no compliments, pray—I have not leisure now to attend to you—for, positively, I must go back to Belinda, to see their reconciliation—will you go with me, Mr. Bellmont?—</p>

<p>This rash, unaccountable man!—How could he entertain such a suspicion!—Ungratesul Beverley!—He

<p>Not yet, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>I wonder what keeps him.—I am upon thorns till I see the dear, ungenerous man, and explain every thing to him—Oh! Mr. Beverley! how could you treat me so?—But I was partly to blame; my lady Restless inflamed his mind, and I should not have trisled with his passion—Is the other servant returned from Sir John Restless?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>He is, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Sir John will wait upon you himself, madam, directly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Very well!—I must get him to set every thing in its true light, and justify me to Mr. Beverley: and yet the uncertainty of his temper alarms me strangely—his eternal suspicions!—but there is nothing in that—my future conduct,—my regard for him will cure that disease, and then—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>TIP.</speaker>
<p>I dare be sworn it will, ma'am.</p>
</sp>

<p>In compliance with your commands, Madam.</p>

<sp>

<p>Sir, I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have been pleased to give yourself—A particular circumstance has happened in your family, to my utter disquiet—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Madam, there have happened things in my family, to my utter disquiet too—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>I am sorry for that, Sir—but I assure you I have been made quite unhappy, and must beg, as it is in your power, that you will be kind enough to remove the cause of my uneasiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Whatever I can do, you may command.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I thank you, and must tell you, that your lady has done me the most irreparable injury.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! she has done the same to me—my injuries are irreparable too—but how has she injured you, madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>She has ruined me, Sir, with the man I love to distraction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Now, here something else will come to light, <stage>(<hi>aside.</hi>)</stage>—How, how has she done that, madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Sir, she has entirely drawn off his affections from me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>And fixed them upon herself, I suppose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>I don't say that, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>But I dare say it; and I believe it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="69" facs="72"/>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, Sir, I don't charge the lady with any thing of that kind—but she has unaccountably taken it into her head to be jealous of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Jealous of you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Her ladyship saw the little offices of civility I received from you this morning—She misunderstood every thing, it seems, and has told the gentleman with whom I was engaged in a treaty of marriage, that improper freedoms have passed between us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Artifice! artifice!—her usual policy, madam, to cover her own libertine ways.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>I don't mean to say any thing harsh of the lady—but you know what foundation there is for this, and I hope will do me justice—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! madam, to the world, to the wide world I'll justify you—I will wait upon the gentleman—who is he, madam?—what's his name?—</p>

<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Beverley, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir; you seem surprised—do you know him, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, I know him—and he shall know me—my resentment he shall feel—he shall answer to me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Answer to you!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>To me, madam—I told you at first this was her scheme to shelter herself; and he, I suppose, is combined with her to give this turn to the affair, and to charge me with infidelity—But you, ma'am, can witness for me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>I can, Sir—But can Mr. Beverley be capable of a dishonourable action?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="70" facs="73"/>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! that matter is plain enough; he has injured me in the highest degree, destroyed my happiness—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>How, Sir!—are you sure of this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>He has giver her his picture; I caught her with her eyes rivetted to it; I heard her admiration, her praises of it; her wishes that she had been married to such a man—I saw her print a thousand kisses on it; and in the very fact I wrested it out of her hand—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>I assure you, Sir, if I imagined him to be such as you describe him, I should scarcely be willing to join myself to him for life—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>As you please for that—but, without doubt, you must be very happy with a man of his gallantry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Happy, Sir!—I should be miserable; I should be distracted—I should break my heart—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! it is very likely that he will have a great regard to the honour of the nuptial bed, he, who is so ready to commit a trespass on his neighbour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>But do you think you have sufficient proof?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>I have seen him coming out of my house since, clandestinely, shunning every observant eye, with the characters of guilt in his face, and all the discourse I had with him, served only to convince me the more—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Abandoned wretch!—was this the love he professed for me?—Sir, I have only to hope that you will vindicate me in this matter—I commend myself to your honour, and I thank you for this favour—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Our evidences will mutually speak

<p>Ay!—</p>

<p>Po! po! you talk wildly—this is all raving—you make yourself very ridiculous—you do, indeed—I had settled all this on purpose, and contrived that it should come to your ears, and then knew you would do just as you have done—and—then—I—I—resolved to do just as I have dare—only to hint to you—that listeners seldom hear any good of themselves, and so shew you how wrong it is to be too suspicious, my dear—and was it not well done?—ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p>Yes, I am resolved at length, and I will punish his falsehood and ingratitude by obeying my father's commands.

<p>You see, Sir!—<stage>(<hi>to Sir William.</hi>)</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>I did not think she had been acquainted there—she has got some freak in her head, I fear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>Why, it has an odd appearance this—let us follow her thither—this should be enquired into.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Ay! let us lose no time—let us follow her immediately; come along—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir. WIL.</speaker>
<p>I attend you, Sir—come along, George—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>I will but get my hat, in the next room, Sir, and follow you directly.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>Very well! now I shall see whether you have imposed upon your father—</p>

<stage>BELLMONT, <hi>alone.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<p>And now, Clarissa, now will I explain to you all my sufferings; the very sentiments of my

<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Sir John Restless,—my lady Restless,—I apprehend you are the gentleman, Sir,—and you the lady, ma'am—I came hither in quest of my daughter—so, Belinda!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Are you her father?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>I am, madam,—Mr. Beverley here too!—I see how this is, Belinda—you have eloped from your father, have you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Eloped! mind that Sir John,—the thing is clear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>So I think it is—and I should be glad to know which of you encourages her to take this step.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>All Sir John's doings, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Sir John, I must tell you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Sir, let me assure you first, there is no such thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Heavens deliver me!—how can you say so?—Sir, <stage>(<hi>to Blandford</hi>)</stage> I am very sorry to say any thing disagreeable to a father of his daughter—but, when my happiness is destroyed, ceremony is unnecessary,—your daughter has made me miserable, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>What? how?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Sir John Restless and she, Sir—I cannot speak, <stage>(<hi>cries.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="100" facs="103"/>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Belinda! you will make your father wretched—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>I make you wretched, Sir!—there is no action of my life—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> BELLMONT <hi>and</hi> CLARISSA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>Sir John Restless—this is my son, Sir—he is interested in this matter.—George, things turn out as you told me,— <stage>(<hi>aside to him.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>I am sorry for it, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Blandford, you are father to this lady, Sir—don't make yourself uneasy; for I will vouch for her innocence of my lady's charge against her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>He will deny every thing, no doubt—but facts are too stubborn, and ocular demonstration I have had.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>Ocular demonstration!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir; I have seen their familiarities.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>George, take Clarissa as soon as you will—Mr. Blandford, you will excuse me, if I decline any further treaty with you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Stay but a little till we hear the whole—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I desire to hear no more—I am satisfied, and must desire not to marry my son into your family—Clarissa—you have my consent as soon as you please—my son is at your service—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Then, Sir William, since you provoke me, Sir, you shan't have my daughter.
<pb n="101" facs="104"/>—Mr. Beverley, I no longer oppose your inclinations, she is yours—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>Do you slight my son, Sir?—you use me very ill—and I would have you know—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>You shall never refuse my daughter again, I promise you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>Nor shall you my son, Sir—Here, George, take your Clarissa—I give her away to you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLA.</speaker>
<p>The gentleman has declared himself for that lady, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>No, ma'am, that lady has no share in my affections, and, in compliance with my father's injunctions, thus let me seize your hand, and devote to you all my future days.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>It's very well, Sir William,—Mr. Beverley, here is my daughter for you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Ay, now, if he will accept of her, I shall begin to think that I have been mistaken—and that all my suspicions of the lady are without foundation—But, I dare say, the gentleman knows better—What do you say, Sir? will you marry the lady?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>If that proof will satisfy you, madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Hold, hold, a moment—Explain the business that brought you hither, Sir; answer to Sir John's charge against you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir, answer that—if she agrees to marry him, I shall be satisfied too—But, Sir, my lady's being in possession of your picture, your frequent visits to my house, Sir, and other circumstances—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Sir, a word or two will clear that matter—I had given a picture to this lady in the Park—she, I find, dropped it when she fainted away—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="102" facs="105"/>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Did you faint, Belinda?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>I did, Sir, immediately after you treated me in such severe terms—in the morning—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>And then it was I accidentally came to her relief, which my lady, according to custom, has conceived in the manner you see.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>And how came you by the picture, madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>I found it in the very spot where I saw your daughter in the Park. The truth begins to break in upon me—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Aside.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>This opens my eyes a little—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Aside.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>And have you been ingenious enough, madam, to work up all these circumstances into a charge against Sir John—ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>'I is ever her way, Sir—I told you how ridiculous you would make yourself, my dear; ha! ha!—You see, what your suspicions are come to at last—ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>And you may see, Sir John, what your suspicions are come to—I never was within your doors before this day; nor should I perhaps have spoke to my lady, had it not been for the mistakes your mutual jealousies occasioned between Belinda and me—I cannot help laughing at the whole affair—ha! ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Sir, you may laugh—but I have another complaint against my Lady Restless—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Sir John, Sir John, I have another charge against you—that jade whom you made an assignation with—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! madam, Robert knows that whole affair—I'll bring him hither directly, and
<pb n="103" facs="106"/>convict you before the whole company—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Artful, cunning man! you shan't speak to him apart;—you shan't suborn witnesses—I'll pursue you—gentlemen, let me intreat you to step this way—you will be of great service.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>If we can be of any, madam—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>Faith, I believe all this puzzle has arose from their jealousy; let us see the end of it—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Now, Beverley, now Belinda, make good use of your time, and all will be well still.</p>
</sp>

<p>I have been deceived, I find</p>

<p>If she would but forgive my folly—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Why does he not speak to me?—I can't speak first—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Belinda!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Beverley!— <stage>(<hi>smiles aside.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Don't you think you have been cruel to me, Belinda?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Don't you think you have behaved worse to me, Mr. Beverley?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I have; I grant it; Oh! Belinda!—</p>
</sp>
<stage>takes her hand.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p><stage>(<hi>Without looking at him.</hi>)</stage> You first disordered my whole frame of mind, and can you wonder—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Oh! my soul, my life, it was all my fault.— <stage>(<hi>Throws his arm round her waist</hi>)</stage> do you forgive me?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="104" facs="107"/>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p><stage>(<hi>Leaning on his shoulder</hi>)</stage> You knew the generosity of my temper, the sincerity of my affection, how could you let an extravagance of temper so far get the better—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>I blush for it—do you forgive me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p><stage>(<hi>Drawing closer to him, and smiling</hi>)</stage>—No—I hate you!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p><stage>(<hi>Kissing her cheek</hi>)</stage> Do you hate me, Belinda?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Was it not unkind?—Was it not ungenerous?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>It was—thus on my knees—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! proud man, have I humbled you once more?—Well, now you are on your knees, I forgive you—Beg my picture back of me this moment—</p>
</sp>
<stage>shews it to him.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p><stage>(<hi>Taking it</hi>)</stage> Oh! I will adore it ever, and heal this breach with uninterrupted love—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Sir</hi> JOHN, <hi>Lady</hi> RESTLESS, <hi>Sir</hi> WILLIAM, <hi>Mr.</hi> BLANDFORD, BELLMONT, <hi>and</hi> CLARISSA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha!—yes, faith, I see we have both made ourselves very ridiculous.—Ha! ha—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>I see and acknowledge it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Egad! I own it;—I can laugh at my own folly and my wife's too—ha! ha!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Why yes, Sir John, you have been both terribly in the wrong, indeed;—but, Belinda, don't you be in the wrong too—accept of Mr. Beverley this moment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>If you insist upon it—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>I do insist upon it—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="105" facs="108"/>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>Thus let me take the bright reward of all my wishes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir, and now it's over; you have but commanded me to gratify my inclinations, for we have both seen our error, and frankly confess we have been in the wrong too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir WIL.</speaker>
<p>Faith, I think we have been all so; Mr. Blandford, we should not have opposed their inclinations, when we had it in our power to make two such happy matches instead of one—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Very true; and now I wish the young folks all happiness;—and, Sir John, I wish you and your lady happy too—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Sir, it has been a day of mistakes, but of fortunate ones, I hope, and may tend to all our advantage—My lady here will be taught—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady REST.</speaker>
<p>Sir John, I hope you will be taught—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLAND.</speaker>
<p>Never mention what is past—the wrangling of married people about any little misconduct is only like the lashing of a top; it serves to keep it up the longer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
<p>You are very right, Sir; and as we have been all in the wrong this day, we will, for the future, endeavour to be "All in the Right."</p>
</sp>
<stage>Here Lady Restless talks apart with Belinda.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BEV.</speaker>
<p>A good proposal, Sir John; we will make it our business, both you who are married, and we who are entering into that state, by mutual confidence, to insure mutual happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="106" facs="109"/>
<speaker>BELIN.</speaker>
<p>A match, Mr. Beverley; I subscribe to it;—
<l>The god of love thinks we prophane his fire,</l>
<l>When trifles light as air mistrust inspire.</l>
<l>But where esteem and gen'rous passions spring,</l>
<l>There reigns secure, and waves his purple wing;</l>
<l>Gives home-felt peace, prevents the nuptial strife,</l>
<l>Endears the bliss, and bids it last for life.</l></p>
