<p><seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OTHING can more strongly second the Pleasure I feel, from
the UniversalApplause which crowns this <hi>Orphan</hi> Play, than this
Other which I take in presuming to shelter it under Your Name. I bear so
dear an Affection to the Writings and Memory of SHAKESPEARE, that, as it is my
good Fortune to retrieve this Remnant of his Pen from Obscurity, so it is
my greatest Ambition that <pb facs="5"/> this Piece should be received into
the Protection of such a Patron: And, I hope, Future Times, when they mean to
pay <hi>Shakespeare</hi> the best Compliment, will remember to say, Mr.
DODINGTON was that Friend to his <hi>Remains,</hi> which his own SOUTHAMPTON
was to his <hi>living Merit.</hi></p>
<p>It is from the <hi>fine Discernment</hi> of our Patrons, that we
can generally best promise Ourselves the good Opinion of the Publick.
You are not only a distinguish'd <hi>Friend</hi> of the <hi>Muses,</hi>
but most intimately <hi>allied</hi> to them: And from hence it is I
flatter Myself, that if You shall think fit to pronounce this Piece
genuine, it will silence the Censures of those <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> who
think it impossible a <pb facs="6"/> Manuscript of <hi>Shakespeare</hi>
could so long have lain dormant; and who are blindly paying Me a greater
Compliment than either They design, or I can merit, while they cannot but
confess Themselves <hi>pleased,</hi> yet would fain insinuate that they
are <hi>imposed upon.</hi> I should esteem it some Sort of
<hi>Virtue,</hi> were I able to commit so <hi>agreeable</hi> a
<hi>Cheat.</hi></p>
<p>But pardon Me, Sir, for a Digression that perverts the very
Rule of Dedications. I own, I have my Reasons for it. As, SIR, your known
Integrity, and Honour engages the warmest Wishes of all good Men for your
Prosperity, so your known Distinction in polite Letters, and your
generous Encouragement of Those who pretend to them, obliges us to
consider your Advancement <pb facs="7"/> as our own personal Interest, and
as a good Omen, at least, if not as the surest Means of the future
flourishing Condition of those <hi>Humane</hi> Arts amongst us, which We
<hi>profess,</hi> and which You <hi>adorn.</hi> But neither Your Modesty,
nor my Inability will suffer me to enter upon that Subject. Permit me
therefore, SIR, to convert <hi>Panegyrick</hi> into a most ardent Wish,
that You would look with a Tender Eye on this <hi>dear Relick,</hi> and that
you would believe me, with the most unfeigned Zeal and Respect,</p>

<head>PREFACE OF THE EDITOR.</head>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Success, which this Play has met with from the Town in the
Representation, (to say nothing of the Reception it found from those
Great Judges, to whom I have had the Honour of communicating it in
Manuscript;) has almost made the Purpose of a Preface unnecessary:
And therefore what I have to say, is design'd rather to wipe out a flying
Objection to two, than to labour at proving it the Production of
<hi>Shakespeare.</hi> It has been alledg'd as incredible, that such a
Curiosity should be stifled and lost to the World for above a Century.
To This my Answer is short; that tho' it never till now made its Appearance
on the Stage, yet one of the Manuscript Copies, which I have, is of above
Sixty Years Standing, in the Handwriting of Mr. <hi>Downes,</hi> the famous
Old Prompter; and, as I am credibly inform'd, was early in the
Possession of the celebrated Mr. <hi>Betterton,</hi> and by Him
design'd to have been usher'd into the World. What Accident prevented This
Purpose of his, I do not pretend to know: Or thro' what hands it had
successively pass'd before that Period of Time. There is a Tradition
(which I have from the Noble Person, who supply'd me with One of my Copies)
that it was given by our Author, as a Present of Value, to a Natural Daughter
of his, for whose Sake he wrote it, in the Time of his Retirement from the
Stage. Two other Copies I have, (one of which I was glad to purchase
<pb facs="9"/> at a very good Rate,) which may not, perhaps, be quite so Old as
the Former; but One of Them is much more perfect, and has fewer Flaws and
Interruptions in the Sense.</p>
<p>Another Objection has been started, (which would carry much more
Weight with it, were it Fact;) that the Tale of this Play, being built upon a
Novel in <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> Chronology is against Us, and
<hi>Shakespeare</hi> could not be the Author. But it happens, that <hi>Don
Quixot</hi> was publish'd in the Year 1611, and <hi>Shakespeare</hi> did
not dye till <hi>April</hi> 1616, a sufficient Interval of Time for All that
We want granted.</p>
<p>Others again, to depreciate the Affair, as they thought, have been
pleased to urge, that tho' the Play may have some Resemblances of
<hi>Shakespeare,</hi> yet the <hi>Colouring, Diction,</hi> and
<hi>Characters,</hi> come nearer to the Style and Manner of FLETCHER. This, I
think, is far from deserving any Answer; I submit it to the Determination
of better Judgments; tho' my Partiality for <hi>Shakespeare</hi> makes me
wish, that Every Thing which is good, or pleasing, in our Tongue, had been
owing to his Pen.</p>
<p>As to the Performance of the respective <hi>Actors</hi>
concern'd in this Play, my applauding It here would be altogether
superfluous. The Publick has distinguish'd and given them a Praise,
much beyond Any that can flow from my Pen. But I have some particular
Acknowledgments to make to the <hi>Managers</hi> of this Company, for which I
am glad to embrace so fair an Opportunity.</p>
<p>I came to Them at this Juncture as an <hi>Editor,</hi> not an
<hi>Author,</hi> and have met with so much Candour, and handsome Treatment
from Them, that I am willing to believe, the Complaint, which has so commonly
obtain'd, of their Disregard and ill Behaviour to Writers, has been more
severely urg'd, than it is justly grounded. They must certainly be too
good Judges of their own Interest, not to know that a Theatre cannot always
subsist on old Stock, but that the Town requires Novelty at their Hands.
On the other Hand, they must be so far Judges of their own Art and
Profession, as to know that all the Compositions, which are offer'd them,
would never go down with Audiences of so nice and delicate a Taste, as in
this Age frequent the Theatres. It would be very hard upon such a Community,
where so many Interests are concern'd, and so much Merit in their
Business allow'd, if they had not a Priviledge of refusing some crude
Pieces, too imperfect for the Entertainment of the Publick I would not be
thought to inferr, that they have never discourag'd what They might,
perhaps, afterwards wish they had receiv'd. They do not, I believe, set up
for such a Constant <pb facs="10"/> Infallibility. But if We do but fairly
consider out of above Four Thousand Plays extant, how small a Number
will now stand the Test: if We do but consider too, how often a raw
Performance has been extoll'd by the Partiality of private Friendship; and
what a Clamour of Injury has been rais'd from that Quarter, upon such
Performance meeting a Repulse; we may pretty easily account for the Grounds
upon which they proceeded in discountenancing some Plays, and the harsh
Things that are thrown out upon their giving a Repulse to others.</p>
<p>But I should beg Pardon for interfering in this Question, in
which I am properly neither Party, nor Judge. I am only throwing out a private
Opinion, without Interest or Prejudice, and if I am right in the Notion,
<hi>Valeat quantum valere potest.</hi></p>

<lg>
<l>AS in some Region, where indulgent Skies</l>
<l>Enrich the Soil, a thousand Plants arise</l>
<l>Frequent and bold; a thousand Landskips meet</l>
<l>Our ravisht View, irregularly sweet:</l>
<l>We gaze, divided, now on These, now Those;</l>
<l>While All one beauteous Wilderness compose.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Such <hi>SHAKESPEARE</hi>'s Genius was:—Let
<hi>Britons</hi> boast</l>
<l>The glorious Birth, and, eager, strive who most</l>
<l>Shall celebrate his Verse; for while we raise</l>
<l>Trophies of Fame to him, ourselves we praise▪</l>
<l>Display the Talents of a <hi>British</hi> Mind,</l>
<l>Where All is great, free, open, unconfin'd.</l>
<l>Be it our Pride, to reach his daring Flight;</l>
<l>And relish Beauties, he alone could write.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Most modern Authors, fearful to aspire,</l>
<l>With Imitation cramp their genial Fire;</l>
<l>The well-schemed Plan keep strict before their Eyes,</l>
<l>Dwell on Proportions, trifling Decencies;</l>
<l>While noble Nature all neglected lies.</l>
<l>Nature, that claims Precedency of Place,</l>
<l>Perfection's Basis, and essential Grace!</l>
<l><pb facs="12"/> Nature so intimately <hi>SHAKESPEARE</hi>
knew,</l>
<l>From her first Springs his Sentiments he drew;</l>
<l>Most greatly wild they flow; and, when most wild, yet
true.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>While These, secure in what the Criticks teach,</l>
<l>Of servile Laws still dread the dangerous Breach;</l>
<l>His vast, unbounded, Soul disdain'd their Rule,</l>
<l>Above the Precepts of the Pedant School!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Oh! could the Bard, revisiting our Light,</l>
<l>Receive these Honours done his Shade To-night,</l>
<l>How would he bless the Scene this Age displays,</l>
<l>Transcending his <hi>Eliza</hi>'s golden Days!</l>
<l>When great <hi>AUGUSTUS</hi> fills the <hi>British</hi>
Throne,</l>
<l>And his lov'd <hi>Consort</hi> makes the Muse her own.</l>
<l>How would he joy, to see fair Merit's Claim</l>
<l>Thus answer'd in his own reviving Fame!</l>
<l>How cry with Pride—" <hi>Oblivion I forgive</hi>;</l>
<l>" <hi>This my last Child to latest Times shall
live</hi>:</l>
<l>" <hi>Lost to the World, well for the Birth it
stay'd</hi>;</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by a Friend.</byline>
<stage>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>OLDFIELD.</hi></stage>
<lg>
<l>WELL, Heaven defend us from these ancient Plays,</l>
<l>These Moral Bards of good Queen <hi>Bess</hi>'s Days!</l>
<l>They write from Virtue's Laws, and think no further;</l>
<l>But draw a Rape as dreadful as a Murther.</l>
<l>You modern Wits, more deeply vers'd in Nature,</l>
<l>Can tip the wink, to tell us, you know better;</l>
<l>As who shou'd say—" 'Tis no such killing
Matter—</l>
<l>" We've heard old Stories told, and yet ne'er wonder'd,</l>
<l>" Of many a Prude, that has endur'd a Hundred:</l>
<l>" And <hi>Violante</hi> grieves, or we're mistaken,</l>
<l>" Not, because ravisht; but
because—forsaken.—</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Had this been written to the modern Stage,</l>
<l>Her Manners had been copy'd from the Age.</l>
<l>Then, tho' she had been once a little wrong,</l>
<l>She still had had the Grace to've held her Tongue;</l>
<l>And after all, with downcast Looks, been led</l>
<l>Like any Virgin to the Bridal Bed.</l>
<l>There, if the good Man question'd her Mis-doing,</l>
<l>She'd stop him short—" Pray, who made you so
knowing?</l>
<l>" What, doubt my Virtue!—What's your base Intention?</l>
<l>" Sir, that's a Point above your Comprehension.—</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="14"/>
<l>Well, Heav'n be prais'd, the Virtue of our Times</l>
<l>Secures us from our <hi>Gothick</hi> Grandsires Crimes.</l>
<l>Rapes, Magick, new Opinions, which before</l>
<l>Have fill'd our Chronicles, are now no more:</l>
<l>And this reforming Age may justly boast,</l>
<l>That dreadful Sin <hi>Polygamy</hi> is lost.</l>
<l>So far from multiplying Wives, 'tis known</l>
<l>Our Husbands find, they've Work enough with one.—</l>
<l>Then, as for Rapes, those dangerous days are past;</l>
<l>Our Dapper Sparks are seldom in such haste.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>In <hi>SHAKESPEARE</hi>'s Age the <hi>English</hi> Youth
inspir'd,</l>
<l>Lov'd, as they fought, by him and Beauty fir'd.</l>
<l>'Tis yours to crown the Bard, whose Magick Strain</l>
<l>Cou'd charm the Heroes of that glorious Reign,</l>
<l>Which humbled to the Dust the Pride of <hi>Spain.</hi></l>

<stage>Enters <hi>Julio.</hi></stage>
<p>O, come on, Sir; read this Paper: no more Ado, but read it:
It must not be answer'd by my Hand, nor yours, but, in Gross, by your
Person; your sole Person. Read aloud.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>'Please you, to let me first o'erlook it, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>I was this other day in a Spleen against your new Suits: I
do now think, some Fate was the Taylour that hath fitted them: for, this
Hour, they are for the Palace of the Duke.—Your Father's House is too
dusty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="23"/>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Hem!—to Court? Which is the better, to serve a
Mistress, or a Duke? I am sued to be his Slave, and I sue to be
<hi>Leonora</hi>'s. <stage>[Aside.</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>You shall find your Horsemanship much praised there;
Are you so good a Horseman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>I have been,</l>
<l>E'er now, commended for my Seat, or mock'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Take one Commendation with another, every Third's a
Mock.—Affect not therefore to be praised. Here's a deal of Command and
Entreaty mixt; there's no denying; you must go, peremptorily he inforces
That.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>What Fortune soever my Going shall encounter, cannot be
good Fortune; What I part withal unseasons any other Goodness. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>You must needs go; he rather conjures, than
importunes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>No moving of my Love-Suit to him now?— <stage>[Aside.</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Great Fortunes have grown out of less Grounds.</p>

<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>What may her Father think of me, who expects to be
sollicited this very Night? <stage>[Aside.</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Those scatter'd Pieces of Virtue, which are in him, the
Court will solder together, varnish, and rectify.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>He will surely think I deal too slightly, or
unmannerly, or foolishly, indeed; nay, dishonestly; to bear him in hand
with my Father's Consent, who yet hath not been touch'd with so much as a
Request to it. <stage>[Aside.</stage> </p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir, have you read it over?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>And consider'd it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>As I can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>If you are courted by good Fortune, you must go.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>So it please You, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="24"/>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>By any Means, and to morrow: Is it not there the Limit of
his Request?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<p>It is, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>I must bethink me of some Necessaries, without
which you might be unfurnish'd: And my Supplies shall at all Convenience
follow You. Come to my Closet by and by; I would there speak with You.</p>

<l>I do not see that Fervour in the Maid,</l>
<l>Which Youth and Love should kindle. She consents,</l>
<l>As 'twere to feed without an Appetite;</l>
<l>Tells me, She is content; and plays the Coy one,</l>
<l>Like Those that subtly make their Words their Ward,</l>
<l>Keeping Address at Distance. This Affection</l>
<l>Is such a feign'd One, as will break untouch'd;</l>
<l>Dye frosty, e'er it can be thaw'd; while mine,</l>
<l>Like to a Clime beneath <hi>Hyperion</hi>'s Eye,</l>
<l>Burns with one constant Heat. I'll strait go to her;</l>
<l>Pray her to regard my Honour: but She greets me.—</l>
<stage>Enter <hi>Leonora,</hi> and Maid.</stage>
<l>See, how her Beauty doth inrich the Place!</l>
<l>O, add the Musick of thy charming Tongue,</l>
<l>Sweet as the Lark that wakens up the Morn,</l>
<l>And make me think it Paradise indeed.</l>
<l>I was about to seek thee, <hi>Leonora,</hi></l>
<l>And chide thy Coldness, Love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>—What says your Father?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>I have not mov'd him yet.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>—Then do not, <hi>Julio.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>Not move him? Was it not your own Command,</l>
<l>That his Consent should ratify our Loves?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Perhaps, it was: but now I've chang'd my Mind.</l>
<l>You purchase at too dear a Rate, that puts You</l>
<l>To wooe me and your Father too: Besides,</l>
<l>As He, perchance, may say, you shall not have me;</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="25"/> You, who are so obedient, must
discharge me</l>
<l>Out of your Fancy: Then, you know, 'twill prove</l>
<l>My Shame and Sorrow, meeting such Repulse,</l>
<l>To wear the Willow in my Prime of Youth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>Oh! do not rack me with these ill-placed Doubts;</l>
<l>Nor think, tho' Age has in my Father's Breast</l>
<l>Put out Love's Flame, he therefore has not Eyes,</l>
<l>Or is in Judgment blind. You wrong your Beauties,</l>
<l><hi>Venus</hi> will frown if you disprize her Gifts,</l>
<l>That have a Face would make a frozen Hermit</l>
<l>Leap from his Cell, and burn his Beads to kiss it;</l>
<l>Eyes, that are nothing but continual Births</l>
<l>Of new Desires in Those that view their Beams.</l>
<l>You cannot have a Cause to doubt.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>—Why, <hi>Julio?</hi></l>
<l>When you that dare not chuse without your Father,</l>
<l>And, where you love, you dare not vouch it; must not,</l>
<l>Though you have Eyes, see with 'em;—can I, think
you,</l>
<l>Somewhat, perhaps, infected with your Suit,</l>
<l>Sit down content to say, You would, but dare not?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>Urge not Suspicions of what cannot be;</l>
<l>You deal unkindly; mis-becomingly,</l>
<l>I'm loth to say: For All that waits on you,</l>
<l>Is graced, and graces.—No Impediment</l>
<l>Shall bar my Wishes, but such grave Delays</l>
<l>As Reason presses Patience with; which blunt not,</l>
<l>But rather whet our Loves. Be patient, Sweet.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon</speaker>
<l>Patient! What else? My Flames are in the Flint.</l>
<l>Haply, to lose a Husband I may weep;</l>
<l>Never, to get One: When I cry for Bondage,</l>
<l>Let Freedom quit me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>—From what a Spirit comes This?</l>
<l>I now perceive too plain, you care not for me.</l>
<l>Duke, I obey thy Summons, be its Tenour</l>
<l>Whate'er it will: If War, I come thy Souldier:</l>
<l>Or if to waste my silken Hours at Court,</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="26"/> The Slave of Fashion, I with willing
Soul</l>
<l>Embrace the lazy Banishment for Life;</l>
<l>Since <hi>Leonora</hi> has pronounc'd my Doom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>What do you mean? Why talk you of the Duke?</l>
<l>Wherefore of War, or Court, or Banishment?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>How this new Note is grown of me, I know not;</l>
<l>But the Duke writes for Me. Coming to move</l>
<l>My Father in our Bus'ness, I did find him</l>
<l>Reading this Letter; whose Contents require</l>
<l>My instant Service, and Repair to Court.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Now I perceive the Birth of these Delays;</l>
<l>Why <hi>Leonora</hi> was not worth your Suit.</l>
<l>Repair to Court? Ay, there you shall, perhaps,</l>
<l>(Rather, past Doubt;) behold some choicer Beauty,</l>
<l>Rich in her Charms, train'd to the Arts of Soothing,</l>
<l>Shall prompt you to a Spirit of Hardiness,</l>
<l>To say, So please you, Father, I have chosen</l>
<l>This Mistress for my own.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>—Still you mistake me:</l>
<l>Ever your Servant I profess my self;</l>
<l>And will not blot me with a Change, for all</l>
<l>That Sea and Land inherit.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>But when go you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>To morrow, Love; so runs the Duke's Command;</l>
<l>Stinting our Farewell-kisses, cutting off</l>
<l>The Forms of Parting, and the Interchange</l>
<l>Of thousand precious Vows, with Haste too rude.</l>
<l>Lovers have Things of Moment to debate,</l>
<l>More than a Prince, or dreaming Statesman, know:</l>
<l>Such Ceremonies wait on <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Throne.</l>
<l>Why heav'd that Sigh?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>O <hi>Julio,</hi> let me whisper</l>
<l>What, but for Parting, I should blush to tell thee:</l>
<l>My Heart beats thick with Fears, lest the gay Scene,</l>
<l>The Splendors of a Court, should from thy Breast</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="27"/> Banish my Image, kill my Int'rest in
thee,</l>
<l>And I be left, the Scoff of Maids, to drop</l>
<l>A Widow's Tear for thy departed Faith.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>O let Assurance, strong as Words can bind,</l>
<l>Tell thy pleas'd Soul, I will be wond'rous faithful;</l>
<l>True, as the Sun is to his Race of Light,</l>
<l>As Shade to Darkness, as Desire to Beauty:</l>
<l>And when I swerve, let Wretchedness o'ertake me,</l>
<l>Great as e'er Falshood met, or Change can merit.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Enough; I'm satisfied: and will remain</l>
<l>Yours, with a firm and untir'd Constancy.</l>
<l>Make not your Absence long: Old Men are wav'ring;</l>
<l>And sway'd by Int'rest more than Promise giv'n.</l>
<l>Should some fresh Offer start, when you're away,</l>
<l>I may be prest to Something, which must put</l>
<l>My Faith, or my Obedience, to the Rack.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>Fear not, but I with swiftest Wing of Time</l>
<l>Will labour my Return. And in my Absence,</l>
<l>My noble Friend, and now our honour'd Guest,</l>
<l>The Lord <hi>Henriquez,</hi> will in my behalf</l>
<l>Hang at your Father's Ear, and with kind Hints,</l>
<l>Pour'd from a friendly Tongue, secure my Claim;</l>
<l>And play the Lover for thy absent <hi>Julio.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Is there no Instance of a Friend turn'd false?</l>
<l>Take Heed of That: No Love by Proxy, <hi>Julio.</hi></l>
<l>My Father—</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enters <hi>Don Bernard.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>What, <hi>Julio,</hi> in publick? This Wooeing is too
urgent. Is your Father yet moved in the Suit, who must be the prime Unfolder
of this Business?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>I have not yet, indeed, at full possess'd</l>
<l>My Father, whom it is my Service follows;</l>
<l>But only that I have a Wife in Chase.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>Chase!—Let Chase alone: No Matter for
That.—You may halt after her, whom you profess to pursue, and catch
her too; Marry, not <pb n="9" facs="28"/> unless your Father let you
slip.—Briefly, I desire you, (for she tells me, my Instructions
shall be both Eyes and Feet to her;) no farther to insist in your
Requiring, 'till, as I have formerly said, <hi>Camillo</hi> make known to
Me, that his good Liking goes along with Us; which but once breath'd, all is
done; 'till when, the Business has no Life, and cannot find a
Beginning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jul.</speaker>
<l>Sir, I will know his Mind, e'er I taste Sleep:</l>
<l>At Morn, you shall be learn'd in his Desire.</l>
<l>I take my Leave.—O virtuous <hi>Leonora,</hi></l>
<l>Repose, sweet as thy Beauties, seal thy Eyes;</l>
<l>Once more, adieu. I have thy Promise, Love;</l>
<l>Remember, and be faithful.</l>
</sp>
<stage>[Ex. <hi>Julio.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>His Father is as unsettled, as he is wayward, in his
Disposition. If I thought young <hi>Julio</hi>'s Temper were not mended by
the Mettal of his Mother, I should be something crazy in giving my
Consent to this Match: And, to tell you true, if my Eyes might be the
Directors to your Mind, I could in this Town look upon Twenty Men of more
delicate Choice. I speak not This altogether to unbend your Affections to
him: But the Meaning of what I say is, that you set such Price upon
yourself to him, as Many, and much his Betters, would buy you at; (and reckon
those Virtues in you at the rate of their Scarcity;) to which if he come not
up, you remain for a better Mart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>My Obedience, Sir, is chain'd to your Advice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>'Tis well said, and wisely. I fear, your Lover is a
little Folly-tainted; which, shortly after it proves so, you will
repent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I confess, I approve him of all the Men I know; but
that Approbation is nothing, 'till season'd by your Consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>We shall hear soon what his Father will do, and so
proceed accordingly. I have no great Heart to the Business, neither will I
with any Violence oppose <pb n="10" facs="29"/> it: But leave it to that Power
which rules in these Conjunctions, and there's an End. Come; haste We
homeward, Girl.</p>

<speaker>Henr.</speaker>
<l>To have enjoy'd her, I would have given—What?</l>
<l>All that at present I could boast my own,</l>
<l>And the Reversion of the World to boot,</l>
<l>Had the Inheritance been mine:—And now,</l>
<l>(Just Doom of guilty Joys!) I grieve as much</l>
<l>That I have rifled all the Stores of Beauty,</l>
<l>Those Charms of Innocence and artless Love,</l>

<l>That she refus'd my Vows, and shut the Door</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Lop.</speaker>
<p>Love! Love!—Downright Love! I see by the
Foolishness of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henr.</speaker>
<p>Now then to Recollection—Was't not so? A Promise
first of Marriage—Not a Promise only, for 'twas bound with Surety of
a thousand Oaths;—and those not light ones neither.—Yet I
remember too, those Oaths could not prevail; th' unpractis'd Maid trembled to
meet my Love: By Force alone I <pb n="14" facs="33"/> snatch'd th' imperfect
Joy, which now torments my Memory. Not Love, but brutal Violence prevail'd; to
which the Time, and Place, and Opportunity, were Accessaries most
dishonourable. Shame, Shame upon it!</p>

<p>Hold, let me be severe to my Self, but not
unjust.—Was it a Rape then? No. Her Shrieks, her Exclamations then had
drove me from her. True, she did not consent; as true, she did
resist; but still in Silence all.—'Twas but the Coyness of a
modest Bride, not the Resentment of a ravisht Maid. And is the Man yet
born, who would not risque the Guilt, to meet the Joy?—The Guilt!
that's true—but then the Danger; the Tears, the Clamours of the ruin'd
Maid, pursuing me to Court. That, that, I fear will (as it already does my
Conscience) something shatter my Honour. What's to be done? But now I
have no Choice. Fair <hi>Leonora</hi> reigns confest the Tyrant Queen of my
revolted Heart, and <hi>Violante</hi> seems a short Usurper
there.—<hi>Julio</hi>'s already by my Arts remov'd.—O Friendship,
how wilt thou answer That? Oh, that a Man could reason down this Feaver of
the Blood, or sooth with Words the Tumult in his Heart! Then,
<hi>Julio,</hi> I might be, indeed, thy Friend. They, they only should
condemn me, who born devoid of Passion ne'er have prov'd the fierce
Disputes 'twixt Virtue and Desire. While they, who have, like me,</p>

<l>O Kiss, sweet as the Odours of the Spring,</l>

<l>Say, <hi>Leonora,</hi> has your Father conquer'd?</l>

<l><pb n="18" facs="37"/> Thro' which his Heart speaks more

<l>It offers Joy and Happiness to You,</l>
<l>And Honour to our House. Imagine then</l>
<l>The Birth and Qualities of him that loves you;</l>
<l>Which when you know, you cannot rate too dear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>My Father, on my Knees I do beseech you</l>
<l>To pause one Moment on your Daughter's Ruin.</l>
<l>I vow, my Heart ev'n bleeds, that I must thank you</l>
<l>For your past Tenderness; and yet distrust</l>
<l>That which is yet behind. Consider, Sir,</l>
<l>Whoe'er's th' Occasion of another's Fault,</l>
<l>Cannot himself be innocent. O, give not</l>
<l>The censuring World Occasion to reproach</l>
<l>Your harsh Commands; or to my Charge lay That</l>
<l>Which most I fear, the Fault of Disobedience.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>Pr'ythee, fear neither the One, nor the Other: I tell thee,
Girl, there's more Fear than Danger. For my own part, as soon as Thou art
married to this noble Lord, my Fears will be over.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Sir, I should be the vainest of my Sex,</l>
<l>Not to esteem myself unworthy far</l>
<l>Of this high Honour. Once there was a Time,</l>
<l>When to have heard my Lord <hi>Henriquez</hi>' Vows,</l>
<l>Might have subdued my unexperienc'd Heart,</l>
<l>And made me wholly his.—But That's now past:</l>
<l>And my firm-plighted Faith by your Consent</l>
<l>Was long since given to the injur'd <hi>Julio.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>Why then, by my Consent e'en take it back again. Thou,
like a simple Wench, hast given thy Affections to a Fellow, that does not
care a Farthing for them. One, that has left thee for a Jaunt to Court; as who
should say, I'll get a Place now; 'tis Time enough to marry, when I'm
turn'd out of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henr.</speaker>
<l>So, surely, it should seem, most lovely Maid;</l>
<l><hi>Julio,</hi> alas, feels nothing of my Passion:</l>
<l>His Love is but th' Amusement of an Hour,</l>
<l>A short Relief from Business, or Ambition,</l>
<l><pb n="19" facs="38"/> The Sport of Youth, and Fashion of
the Age.</l>
<l>O! had he known the Hopes, the Doubts, the Ardours,</l>
<l>Or half the fond Varieties of Passion,</l>
<l>That play the Tyrant with my tortur'd Soul;</l>
<l>He had not left Thee to pursue his Fortune:</l>
<l>To practise Cringes in a slavish Circle,</l>
<l>And barter real Bliss for unsure Honour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Oh, the opposing Wind,</l>
<l>Should'ring the Tide, makes here a fearful Billow:</l>
<l>I needs must perish in it.—Oh, my Lord,</l>
<l>Is it then possible, you can forget</l>
<l>What's due to your great Name, and princely Birth,</l>
<l>To Friendship's holy Law, to Faith repos'd,</l>
<l>To Truth, to Honour, and poor injur'd <hi>Julio?</hi></l>

<l>Think too, this very Hour, where-e'er he be,</l>
<l>Your Favour is the Envy of the Court,</l>
<l>And secret Triumph of his grateful Heart.</l>
<l>Poor <hi>Julio,</hi> how securely thou depend'st</l>
<l>Upon the Faith and Honour of thy Master;</l>
<l>Mistaken Youth! this very Hour he robs thee</l>
<l>Of all thy Heart holds dear.—'Tis so

<l>(O holy Heav'n, that she were living now!)</l>
<l>Forgive and pity me.—Oh, Sir, remember,</l>
<l>I've heard my Mother say a thousand Times,</l>
<l>Her Father would have forced her Virgin Choice;</l>
<l>But when the Conflict was 'twixt Love and Duty,</l>
<l>Which should be first obey'd, my Mother quickly</l>
<l><pb n="20" facs="39"/> Paid up her Vows to Love, and married
You.</l>
<l>You thought this well, and she was praised for This;</l>
<l>For this her Name was honour'd, Disobedience</l>
<l>Was ne'er imputed to her, her firm Love</l>
<l>Conquer'd whate'er oppos'd it, and she prosper'd</l>
<l>Long Time your Wife. My Case is now the same;</l>
<l>You are the Father, which You then condemn'd;</l>

<p>Go to, you're a Fool. No doubt, You have old Stories enough
to undo you.—What, you can't throw yourself away but by Precedent,
ha?—You will needs be married to One, that will None of You? You will be
happy no Body's way but your own, forsooth.—But, d'ye mark me, spare
your Tongue for the future; (and That's using you hardly too, to bid you
spare what you have a great deal too much of:) Go, go your ways, and d'ye
hear, get ready within these Two days to be married to a Husband you don't
deserve;—Do it, or, by my dead Father's Soul, you are no Acquaintance

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>Please to name it, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I have long held You in singular Esteem: and what I
shall now say, will be a Proof of it. You know, Sir, I have but one
Son.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>And the Fortune I am blest withal, You pretty well know
what it is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a fair One, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Such as it is, the whole Reversion is my Son's. He is now
engaged in his Attendance on our Master, the Duke. But e'er he went, he left
with me the Secret of his Heart, his Love for your fair Daughter. For your
Consent, he said, 'twas ready: I took a Night, indeed, to think upon it,
and now have brought you mine; and am come to bind the Contract with half my
Fortune in present, the Whole some time hence, and, in the mean while, my
hearty Blessing. Ha? What say You to't, <hi>Don Bernard?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>Why, really, Neighbour,—I must own, I have heard
Something of this Matter.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Heard Something of it? No doubt, you have.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

Bernard?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>Not mock'd, good <hi>Camillo,</hi> not mock'd: But in
Love-matters, you know, there are Abundance of Changes in half an Hour. Time,
Time, Neighbour, plays Tricks with all of us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Time, Sir! What tell you me of Time? Come, I see how this
goes. Can a little Time take a Man by the Shoulder, and shake off his Honour?
Let me tell you, Neighbour, it must either be a strong Wind, or a very
mellow Honesty that drops so easily. Time, quoth'a?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>Look'ee, <hi>Camillo</hi>; will you please to put your
Indignation in your Pocket for half a Moment, while I tell you the whole Truth
of the Matter. My Daughter, you must know, is such a tender Soul, she
cannot possibly see a Duke's younger Son without falling desperately
in Love with him. Now, you know, Neighbour, when Greatness rides Post after
a Man of my Years, 'tis both Prudence, and good Breeding, to let one's self
be overtaken by it. And who can help all This? I profess, it was not my
seeking, Neighbour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>I profess, a Fox might earth in the Hollowness of your
Heart, Neighbour, and there's an End. If I were to give a bad Conscience its
true Likeness, it should be drawn after a very near Neighbour to a certain
poor Neighbour of yours.—Neighbour! with a Pox.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Bern.</speaker>
<p>Nay, you are so nimble with me, you will hear Nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cam.</speaker>
<p>Sir, if I must speak Nothing, I will hear Nothing. As
for what you have to say, if it comes from your Heart, 'tis a Lye before you
speak it.—I'll to <hi>Leonora</hi>; and if I find her in the same
Story, why, I shall believe your Wife was true to You, and your Daughter is

Jealousie,</l>
<l>Therefore lack'd Love.—So sure as Life shall empty</l>
<l>It self in Death, this new Surmise of mine</l>

<hi>Violante</hi> in Boy's Cloaths.</stage>
<sp>

<p>WELL, he's as sweet a Man, Heav'n comfort him! as ever
these Eyes look'd on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>If he have a Mother, I believe, Neighbours, she's a
Woe-woman for him at this Hour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mast.</speaker>
<p>Why should he haunt these wild unpeopled Mountains,
Where nothing dwells but Hunger, and sharp Winds?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1 Shep.</speaker>
<p>His Melancholy, Sir, that's the main Devil does it. Go to,
I fear he has had too much foul Play offer'd him.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Mast.</speaker>
<p>How gets he Meat?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2 Shep.</speaker>
<p>Why, now and then he takes our Victuals from us, tho' we
desire him to eat; and instead of a short Grace, beats us well and
soundly, and then falls to.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mast.</speaker>
<p>Where lies He?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Ev'n where the Night o'ertakes him.</p>

Woman, or other, be not at the End of this Madness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1 Shep.</speaker>
<p>Well, if he lodg'd within the Sound of us, I knew our
Musick would allure him. How attentively he stood, and how he fix'd his
Eyes, when your Boy sung his Love-Ditty. Oh, here he comes again.</p>

<l>Her spicy Nest: 'till, like a credulous Fool,</l>

<l>And he hath robb'd me of her.—Trust no Friend:</l>
<l>Keep thy Heart's Counsels close.—Hast thou a
Mistress?</l>
<l>Give her not out in Words; nor let thy Pride</l>
<l>Be wanton to display her Charms to View;</l>
<l><pb n="41" facs="60"/> Love is contagious: and a Breath of
Praise,</l>
<l>Or a slight Glance, has kindled up its Flame,</l>
<l>And turn'd a Friend a Traytor.—'Tis in Proof;</l>

<p>Marry, now there is some Moral in his Madness, and we
may profit by it.</p>

<p>Ay, ay; you've all Comforts but I; you have ruin'd me,

<l>I thank your Lordship;</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>—Willingly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<l>The Voice of Parents is the Voice of Gods:</l>
<l>For to their Children they are Heav'n's Lieutenants:</l>
<l>Made Fathers, not for common Uses meerly</l>
<l>Of Procreation; (Beasts and Birds would be</l>
<l><pb n="57" facs="76"/> As noble then as we are) but to steer</l>
<l>The wanton Freight of Youth thro' Storms and Dangers,</l>
<l>Which with full Sails they bear upon: and streighten</l>
<l>The moral Line of Life, they bend so often.</l>
<l>For These are We made Fathers; and for These,</l>
<l>May challenge Duty on our Children's Part.</l>
<l>Obedience is the Sacrifice of Angels,</l>
<l>Whose Form you carry.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>

<stage>[To the Duke.</stage></l>
<l> Let me be so unmanner'd to request,</l>
<l>He would not farther press me with Persuasions</l>

<l>To bury this keen Suit, 'till I shake Hands</l>
<l>With my old Sorrows,—</l>
</sp>

<l>—Why dost look at me?</l>

<l>For such sad Rites must be perform'd, my Lord,</l>
<l>E'er I can love again. Maids, that have lov'd,</l>
<l>If they be worth that noble Testimony,</l>
<l>Wear their Loves here, my Lord; here, in their Hearts;</l>
<l>Deep, deep within; not in their Eyes, or Accents;</l>
<l>Such may be slip'd away; or with two Tears</l>

<l>I give thy Mother Thanks for't—there's no Harm
done.—</l>

<l>As I have Life and Soul, 'tis all a Trick, Sir.</l>
<l>I never saw the Boy before.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Viol.</speaker>
<l>—O Sir,</l>
<l>Call not your Soul to witness in a Wrong:</l>

<l>I never did deceive him: for my Service,</l>
<l><pb n="60" facs="79"/> He had no just Cause; what my Youth
was able,</l>
<l>My Will still put in Act, to please my Master:</l>
<l>I cannot steal; therefore that can be nothing</l>
<l>To my Undoing: no, nor lye; my Breeding,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<l>—Weep not, Child.</l>

<p>This Lord has abused Men, Women, and Children already:
