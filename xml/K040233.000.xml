<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Father of the following little Offspring, being very well convinc'd of the natural Weakness of this his puny Child, did never intend to trust it abroad without the <hi>LEADING STRINGS</hi> of <hi>Action;</hi> had not the Fear of those, who, like Cowards, are afraid of their own Shadows, assiduously oppos'd the Representation; being terribly apprehensive that the Strength of a poor Baby <hi>Monosyllable</hi> might affect the Magnanimity of a <hi>Drawcansir.</hi>—Such is the Force of Self-Conviction!—But as this Infant is oblig'd to walk alone, by many who are resolv'd on it's Appearance, it's Father most humbly desires the good-natur'd Town will not tumble the little Creature into the Dirt; but that they will help it forward over the Kennels of Detraction; and, in Compassion to the Tenderness of it's Age, keep the barking Curs, the Critics, at a Distance.— And to excite them to this Benevolence, here
<pb n="ii" facs="4"/>
follow the Memoirs of the cruel and affecting Period of its Birth, &amp;c.</p>
<p>This Piece of <hi>Fun,</hi> Son to the Father, and Grandson to the Grandfather of the same Name, was conceiv'd, in a Fit of Laughter, about the 8th of <hi>February,</hi> in the Year 1752. —His Mother advanc'd happily in her Pregnancy, and there were great Hopes of a fine Offspring; but, unhappily, just before the Time of her Delivery, Measures were taken, by a certain great Man, to make her miscarry; excited, as some say, to this Piece of Barbarity, by an old Woman's Prophesy which he keeps by him (cast in <hi>leaden</hi> Characters) in a Chest of <hi>Brass</hi> secured, like the <hi>fortunate Tickets</hi> of a Lottery, by <hi>seven Locks:</hi> And of which Prophesy the following is a Transcript:</p>
<l>When <hi>Fun</hi></l>
<l>Has a Son</l>
<l>Then <hi>Drawcansir</hi>'s Race is run.</l>
<p>However childish and ridiculous it may seem for a Man to be affected with such idle Stuff as this, it is not unprecedented or extravagantly strange; since Tradition tells us, that <hi>Saturn,</hi> Father of <hi>JUPITER,</hi> the Great Grandfather of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and many other august Personages, were equally mov'd, by such Instigations, to much the same Absurdities.</p>
<p><pb n="iii" facs="5"/>Notwithstanding, however, all such malignant Measures were taken, the full Time of Pregnancy advanc'd, and the Child was hourly expected; when a <hi>positive Order</hi> came down, that <hi>Mrs. FUN,</hi> who then lay at the <hi>Castle-Tavern, Pater-noster-Row,</hi> must not be brought to-bed within the Walls, lest the Child, which was suspected to be a Bastard, should bring a Scandal on the <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Chastity</hi> of the City. Upon this, even while the Lady lay crying out, the Father waited on the chief Personage of the <hi>Liberties,</hi> with Remonstrances, that the Child was very honestly got, and that none but very creditable People were at the Labour; complaining, at the same Time, that the same Privilege had been permitted an <hi>old Woman</hi> of <hi>a very bad Character,</hi> one <hi>Mother Midnight,</hi> who had often practis'd her Profession there, tho' it was now denied others. —'Twas all in vain: The Gentleman, though he behav'd with a great deal of Politeness and Good-manners, was so prepossess'd against the whole Family of <hi>FUN,</hi> which had been falsely represented to him as of no Character or Reputation, that he not only forbid the Men Midwives doing their Duty, but sent others to see his Orders duly executed.—What could now be done?—<hi>Mrs. FUN</hi> was, in the midst of her Travail, remov'd; and, nobody daring to give her Assistance, her poor Offspring almost perished in the Birth. But
<pb n="iv" facs="6"/>
Nature had been liberal, the <hi>Stamina</hi> were sound, and branched out for Life. 'Tis true, indeed, its Features were so defac'd, that the strong <hi>Likeness</hi> in them was almost lost; and a Weakness, which will be lasting as it's Life, is the Consequence of the Usage it then met with.—If, after all, then, it should fail of answering those Expectations the Town had of it, in Embrio; it will undoubtedly be thought, there is Reason enough to excuse all the Imperfections and Failings it is unhappily afflicted with; since these are so far from being its Faults, that they are Misfortunes which must infallibly engage the Protection of every candid, tender-hearted, <hi>christian</hi> Reader!</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<l>AS dying Sinners hope to get to Heav'n,</l>
<l>And beg and pray to have their Crimes forgiv'n,</l>
<l>So I come here, with humble Supplication,</l>
<l>In Hopes you'll kindly save us from <hi>Damnation.</hi></l>
<l>For you must know the whole of this <hi>Design,</hi></l>
<l>The Plot, the Manner, Sentiment is mine.</l>
<l>'Tis true, we must confess, our motley Piece</l>
<l>Is not confin'd by Laws from <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Greece:</hi></l>
<l>For I disdain old <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Rules,</l>
<l>That tie down Scriblers, limit none but <hi>Fools.</hi></l>
<l>I dare beyond the Goal of Critics run,</l>
<l>What Order should confine the Works of <hi>FUN,</hi></l>
<l>Whose <hi>Self</hi> I am?—And for your Information,</l>
<l>Hear my Birth, Parentage and Education:</l>
<l>My Sire was, thirty Years ago, in Vogue;</l>
<l>His Name was <hi>WIT,</hi> an arch, diverting Rogue;</l>
<l>My Mother's Name was <hi>HUMOUR,</hi> low and poor,</l>
<l>Reduc'd for Want sometimes to play the Whore.</l>
<l>Who best repaid what she was pleas'd to grant,</l>
<l>Was <hi>RIBALDRY,</hi> her favourite Gallant.</l>
<l>Now, little Delicacy dwelt in either,</l>
<l>For, as I'm told, they <hi>all Three</hi> lay together.</l>
<l>Soon after I was born, their darling Son,</l>
<l>A Bastard Compound he!—was christen'd <hi>FUN.</hi></l>
<l><hi>Laughter,</hi> a merry Jade, was chose my Nurse;</l>
<l>Whose <hi>Birth</hi> was mean, but Education worse;</l>
<l>Betimes she taught me to distort the Face,</l>
<l>And sneer at ev'ry Thing but want of Grace;</l>
<l>At twelve Years old she sent me first to School;</l>
<l>My Tutor, <hi>Ignorance,</hi> a Coxcomb and a Fool.</l>
<l>Little I learn'd 'tis true, but ev'ry Day</l>
<l>The Truant play'd, at length ran quite away.</l>
<l>Proud of my Freedom, rambling up and down,</l>
<l><hi>Folly,</hi> a Jilt that ruins half the Town,</l>
<l>Spreading those Arms which ev'ry Fool admires,</l>
<l>Caught me to satisfy her loose Desires.</l>
<l>The Task, tho' hard, I follow'd with Delight;</l>
<l>Sometimes most wisely wrong, and sometimes blindly right;</l>
<l>Above all Order, or the vain Pretence</l>
<l>Of Learning, Genius, Taste or Common Sense.</l>
<l>Who then will censure what may here be done?</l>
<l>What <hi>WIT</hi> will criticise a <hi>PIECE OF FUN?</hi></l>

<p>Father, Father, do but look at that fine Gentleman there, all over Silver amost—why he's as fine again as I am—I warrant his Father must be a Lord.</p>

<p>A Lord! <hi>Antony</hi>—no—no; may be not a Parliament Man.</p>

<p>No! why you told me Father, when you gi'n me a new Coat at your Election, that I was as fine as any Parliament Man's Son in the Nation.</p>

<p>Ay! ay!—well, well he may be a Lord's Son then, for aught I know;—or a Lord's Bastard may be—who knows?</p>

<p>What have you forgot your Nephew— my Name is <hi>Bullyboy</hi>—I am the youngest Son of the Family of the <hi>Bloods.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>N.</hi></speaker>
<p>God so—I beg your Pardon Kinsman —I had indeed almost forgot you—you are grown almost out of Knowlege since you came down to <hi>Tumbledown-hall</hi>—about five years ago, you was not much higher than this. I think —<hi>Humph</hi>—quite a Man! tho' I heard as much from your Mother—well I am very glad to see you—here <hi>Antony</hi>—this, Sir, is my Son <hi>Antony</hi>—come hold up your Head, and let's have none of your Snuffling—why how you stand sucking your Orange, as if you were going to be hang'd.</p>

<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>N.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ay Sir, this Son Sir, I intend to make a great Man—I have brought him up to <hi>London</hi> with me for that Purpose.—You heard I
<pb n="11" facs="19"/>
suppose, I was chosen Member for our Borough, and that obliges me you know to attend the Parliament.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Undoubtedly, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>N.</hi></speaker>
<p>Now Sir, as hereafter, as things may happen and turn out, if so be, I should come to be at the Head of Affairs; I shall want, you know, a good clever Fellow, with a ready Wit, to write your—what do ye call 'em, <hi>Pamphlets</hi> and <hi>News-papers</hi> on my Side, when I want to carry a Point you know.—I am told your great Men have them always in Pay.—Now if I could bring my Son <hi>Antony</hi> to this, I could trust him better than any body else you know, and he might save me Money too.</p>

<p>You must have offended him, I suppose very grossly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Not I—I only said I might be a Lord's Bastard for what I knew.—What Harm was

<p>I'll tell you Sir <hi>Nackadil</hi>—my Cousin <hi>Antony</hi> has the Seeds of ready Wit in his Nature, and only wants a little good Instruction to fit him for the Task you intend him;—if you'll leave him to me, I'll engage myself to give you a good Account of him: —We have Academies here in Town, where he may learn to be a Wit, a Writer, and a Politician in a few Hours.</p>
</sp>

<p>Cod, I took you to be some young Lord, you are so woundy fine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>O Cousin <hi>Antony,</hi> if you stay in Town and keep Company with us <hi>Bloods,</hi> you must leave off that Suit, and lose these lanky Locks of yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Bloods! <hi>Cousin, why what are they? Bloods! Bloods!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Why Sir, I have the Honour to be a <hi>Blood.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>O Cod! I should like to be such another as you very well;—why you look <hi>amost</hi> as well again as I do—tho', tho'f I say't, I'm a clever Fellow in the Main too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Oh! a very clever Fellow, and will be much cleverer if you'll be rul'd by me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Gaush, <hi>I'll do any Thing you</hi> bid <hi>me.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Well then, you shall be a <hi>Blood:</hi>—In the first Place then, you must learn to hate that dry old Dog, that left us just now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="22"/>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>What Father! Oh Cod! I learned that a good while ago.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>And then you must laugh at all he says to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>O gaush! <hi>but he'll break my Head for that tho'.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Pho! pho! you must not mind that,— if he does, you must laugh at him again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>So I will, now I think on't, or suppose I break his Head too: Ha!—hang me if I don't think I could beat him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Bravo! that will do.—And then you must be witty upon ev'ry body.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>What, cut Jokes upon 'em, ha!—oh! I am a <hi>Dab</hi> at that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Ay Sir, but your Country Jokes are nothing, —you must be witty the right Way, or else you're <hi>Nobody;</hi>—you must learn to bully, pull People by the Nose, trip up their Heels, break their Heads, and so forth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but then they must not be so big as I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>No, no, you must always take Care of that—but you may <hi>hum</hi> any body safely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Hum—<hi>ah! pray what's that?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Why; suppose now I was to meet your Father:—I go up to him, and, with a very serious Countenance, say, <hi>Lord Sir, I wonder you can seem so unconcern'd, —do you know that your Son</hi> Antony <hi>is just now drop'd down dead in
<pb n="15" facs="23"/>
an Apoplectick Fit?—Upon my Honour 'tis true.</hi> —So, putting him into the utmost Consternation, go away, and laugh at the old Dog.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Cod, this is good Fun enough, and then he'd run home frighted out of his Wits, and find it all a Joke:—Ha! ha! gaush I like that. —And will this make me a <hi>Blood?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>O Lord Sir, no! these are but half the Qualifications. You must learn <hi>Humour</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>O Sir, I am of a very good <hi>Humour</hi> already.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Oh! that you must break yourself of— and learn to box, talk Baudy, roar and look big.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I can roar and look big—you shall see now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>O Lord Sir! that will never do—This Sir, is the way.</p>
<stage>[Swears loud and affectedly.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>O Lord! O Lord!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>And then to be truly humorous, you must steal Trinkets and Pocket-books from the Ladies, which you are to keep for the Jest's sake;— then Sir, you are to bilk Taverns, —tumble the Waiters down Stairs, —break all the Glasses in your Way, —sally into the Street, —take all the young Women you meet for Whores, and kick the old ones into the Kennel, —knock down the Watch, —lie all Night in <hi>Covent-garden Round-house,</hi> —be carried before the Justice, where you have nothing to
<pb n="16" facs="24"/>
do but to prove your Father a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and the old Dog his Worship will stand by you in abusing all the World.—This, my Boy, is true Humour.—You must also be a Critic.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>A Critic! ha! that's something harder still—is'nt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>No Sir, nothing easier—you can read, I suppose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>O yes, I can read.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Ay, well, but that's not very material,— if you can do any thing more than tell your Letters it will be sufficient.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>My Letters! oh! I could tell my Letters at 4 Years old.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>That's more than some <hi>Critics</hi> can do at <hi>thirty.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>And then I can write very well, and talk <hi>Latin:—Quid agis?</hi> What are you doing?— <hi>Repeto mecum,</hi> I am repeating by myself. <hi>Quid repetis.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Faith, my Boy, you are a better Scholar than half the Critics at <hi>Sam</hi>'s, <hi>George</hi>'s; or the <hi>Bedford.</hi>—But this is not much to the Purpose, Sir, you may criticise upon Authors very well, without ever reading, or even being able to read, them at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Ah! like enough, —criticise, —ah.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>Ay, that's no more than this, Sir, —you must affect to have read <hi>every thing.</hi>—Then
<pb n="17" facs="25"/>
you must frequent all the Coffee-houses where Wit is pretended to; and whenever a Performance is mention'd you must stand thus, and cry with an Air of Disdain;— <hi>Oh Sir, Stuff Sir, Damnation Stuff Sir, stupid Stuff by G—d, —the Author's an Ass, damme.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Ah!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bul.</speaker>
<p>And then at the Appearance of a new Piece upon the Stage, you are to go, because ev'ry body does—Before the Curtain rises, you put the House in a Riot, and afterwards you must groan and cry <hi>Augh, off, no more, no more, Damnation low!</hi>—Oh, and then Sir, you must whip such a Machine as this out of your Pocket, and—</p>
<stage>[Whiststles with a Cat-call.</stage>

<p>Ho! ho! ho! well, that's well enough, —let me try.—<hi>Damnation low!</hi>— <stage>[Whistles.]</stage><hi>Goles,</hi> I believe I shall soon learn,— Well, and will this make me a Blood like you, ha!</p>

<p>Will it?—Then I'll be a Blood, <hi>damme.</hi></p>

<p>I beg Sir <hi>Nackadil Trunnion</hi>'s Pardon in the most submissive Manner, but I hope a Mistake, arising from the many Deceptions People of the poorer, and consequently of the viler, Class put on us, will find an Excuse—And I hope also, the Error his Lordship might possibly, unknowingly, and I am confident unwillingly, committed, is not of such a Nature in itself, as to make either of you slight a Reconciliation. As nothing is more conducive to the Promotion of <hi>Justice</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>Community,</hi> than the perfect Amity of People of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> and which it is necessary they should preserve, in order that the <hi>lower</hi> Part of Mankind should meet with the Punishment due to their Offences—if you will do me the Honour, with his Lordship, to step into the next Room, a Moment, I will attempt to clear up this Affair, in which I am sure, as you are Men of Fortune, there is not, on either Side, any thing contrary to the nicest Points of <hi>Honour,</hi> Justice and Good-manners.</p>
