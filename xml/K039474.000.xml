<head>DEDICATION.</head>
<head type="sub">TO THE PUBLIC.</head>
<opener><salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>PERMIT me to return you my unfeigned thanks for your kind reception of this <hi>Tragedy</hi> on the stage, and to request the continuance of your favour to it in the closet. It would be the highest ingratitude in me to forget the only patron I ever had the good fortune to meet with, by whose powerful assistance I have been enabled to defeat the combined forces of envy, malice and detraction. I must at the same time fairly confess, my victory over the enemy was owing, I believe, as many other victories have been, more to the art and prowess of my <hi>Officers</hi> than to any extraordinary merit of my own. To the first in command, Miss YOUNGE, I have infinite obligations, which I shall always gratefully acknowledge, tho' I may never have it in my power to repay them; nor can the skill and conduct of my generals, REDDISH, SMITH and PALMER, be sufficiently admired. To your patronage and protection I most heartily and sincerely recommend them: If I have been the happy instrument of giving them a favourable opportunity of rising in <hi>your</hi> esteem, it will give me the greatest satisfaction. <hi>You</hi> can best distinguish their merit, and <hi>you</hi> alone are able to reward it.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by a FRIEND.</byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. SMITH.</byline>
<l>A Tragic Tale, from Norman William's Age,</l>
<l>Simple, and unadorn'd, attempts the Stage.</l>
<l>Our silly Bard, more simple than his Tale,</l>
<l>Thinks on your polish'd Manners to prevail;</l>
<l>What in those barb'rous Days were counted Crimes,</l>
<l>Are Slips of course in these enlighten'd Times:</l>
<l>Let not your Ancestors too rude appear,</l>
<l>Though firm in Friendship, and in Love sincere.</l>
<l>Love then like Glory did each Heart inflame,</l>
<l><hi>Beauty</hi> was <hi>Virtue,</hi> and to win it, <hi>Fame,</hi></l>
<l>Now Lovers lose their Mistresses with Grace,</l>
<l>As at New-Market they would lose a Race,</l>
<l>Where, if in Hopes they seem a little cross'd,</l>
<l>'Tis for the Money of the Match that's lost.</l>
<l>When Tilts and Tournaments call'd forth the Brave,</l>
<l>The Fame of spotless Innocence to save,</l>
<l>Each gallant Knight preferr'd his Love to Life,</l>
<l>For <hi>then</hi> the greatest Blessing was a Wife:</l>
<l>To prove their Chastity the dauntless Fair</l>
<l>Would walk through Flames, nor singe a single Hair;</l>
<l>Nay, some so chaste, so cold to all Desire,</l>
<l>Not only scap'd it, they put out the Fire!</l>
<l>But now no Heroes die for Love's sweet Passion,</l>
<l>And <hi>fiery Trials</hi> are quite out of Fashion.</l>
<l>Ye Sons of Frailty—you whom Rage devours,</l>
<l>For you this Night the Muse exerts her Pow'rs;</l>
<l><pb facs="5"/>
With crimson Hands, pale Cheeks, and blood-shot Eyes,</l>
<l>She bids the Furies in their Terrors rise!</l>
<l>In Valour's Breast their Scorpion Stings they dart,</l>
<l>First fire the Brain, and then corrupt the Heart.</l>
<l>But what avails all Virtue! Passion's gust,</l>
<l>Like Whirlwinds, drive it from the Heart like Dust;</l>
<l>When Reason dawns, well may Repentance mourn</l>
<l>Love, Friendship, Duty, by the Roots up-torn.</l>
<l>To sooth this fatal Vice, the Flatterer tells</l>
<l>In stormy Minds how warmest Friendship dwells;</l>
<l>The Tree whose sheltering Arms spread kindly round,</l>
<l>If Light'ning-struck, lies blasted on the Ground;</l>
<l>In vain will Merits past Indulgence claim,</l>
<l>One Moment's Rashness blasts whole Years of Fame.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>By the AUTHOR of the TRAGEDY.</byline>
<byline>Spoken by Miss YOUNGE.</byline>
<lg>
<l>HA! ha! poor Creature! how you trembling stand!</l>
<l>Come to the Bar, Sir, and hold up your Hand;</l>
<l>You won't—by Council then you'd have it done,</l>
<l>And I must plead your Cause—well, get you gone.</l>
<stage>[Coming forward to the Audience.</stage>
<l>Now for the great Tribunal of Old Drury;</l>
<l>Are you all sworn there—Gem'men of the Jury?</l>
<l>Good Men, and true, I hope—stay, let me see,</l>
<l>Amongst you all he challenges—but three.</l>
<l>Physicians, Lawyers, Parsons he admits,</l>
<l>Beaux, Ladies, Courtiers, Macaronies, Cits,</l>
<l>And only scratches—<hi>Critics, News-writers,</hi> and <hi>Wits.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The <hi>Critic</hi> first we banish from our Session,</l>
<l>Death is his Trade, and Damning—his Profession;</l>
<l>Disqualisy'd—because, to say no further,</l>
<l>Butchers are never heard in case of Murther.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Next we disclaim th' <hi>Artificers</hi> of <hi>News,</hi></l>
<l>Who live by Fibs, and flourish by Abuse;</l>
<l>They must condemn, or lose their daily Bread;</l>
<l>If they don't cut, and slash—they're never read;</l>
<l>Like fabled Giants here they roam for Food,</l>
<l>And Fe! Fa! Fum! snuff up an Author's Blood;</l>
<l>In the next <hi>Ledger</hi> hang him up to roast,</l>
<l>Or tear him Piece-meal in—the <hi>Morning Post.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>To <hi>Wits</hi> we last except, and 'bove all other,</l>
<l>The Hero of our Tale—a <hi>Rival Brother!</hi></l>
<l><pb facs="7"/>
As Rogues, just 'scap'd the Gallows, join the Shrieves,</l>
<l>Turn Hangmen, and tuck up their Fellow Thieves;</l>
<l>So Bards condemn'd, exert the Critic's Skill,</l>
<l>And execute their Brethren of the Quill!</l>
<l>If like their own, indeed, the Brat should die,</l>
<l>They'll gladly join to write—its Elegy;</l>
<l>But if the Child is strong, and like to live,</l>
<l>That is a Crime they never can forgive.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>From such let English Juries still be free,</l>
<l>Our Author here appeals to your Decree,</l>
<l>The Public is—a Court of Equity.</l>
<l>If he has shock'd your Taste, your Sense, or Reason,</l>
<l>Or against Nature guilty been of Treason,</l>
<l>Off with his Head;—but if with honest Art</l>
<l>His well-meant Scenes have touch'd the feeling Heart;</l>
<l>If they have rais'd your Pity, wak'd your Fears,</l>
<l>Or sweetly have "beguil'd you of your Tears,"</l>
<l>Let venial Errors your Indulgence claim,</l>
<l>Your Voice his Triumph, your Applause his Fame.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Speak by your Foreman—what says Goodman Pit?</l>
<l>Will you condemn the Prisoner, or acquit?</l>
<l>Your Verdict, Sirs, <hi>Not Guilty</hi>—if you please—</l>
<l>You smile—<hi>Acquitted</hi>—hope you'll pay his Fees.</l>

<stage>MATILDA, BERTHA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>I Thank thee, gentle Bertha, for thy goodness;</l>
<l>If aught cou'd sooth the anguish of my soul,</l>
<l>Or raise it from the horrors of despair</l>
<l>To hope and joy, 'twou'd be thy gen'rous friendship:</l>
<l>But I am sunk so deep in misery,</l>
<l>That comfort cannot reach me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>Talk not thus,</l>
<l>My sweet Matilda; innocence, like thine,</l>
<l>Must be the care of all-directing heav'n.</l>
<l>Already hath the interposing hand</l>
<l>Of providence redeem'd thee from the rage</l>
<l>Of savage war, and shelter'd thee within</l>
<l>This calm asylum. Mercia's potent Earl,</l>
<l>The noble Morcar, will protect thy virtues;</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="9"/>
And, if I err not, wishes but to share</l>
<l>His conquests with thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>O my friend, oft times</l>
<l>The flow'ry path that tempts our wand'ring steps</l>
<l>But leads to mis'ry; what thou fondly deem'st</l>
<l>My soul's best comfort, is its bitt'rest woe.</l>
<l>Earl Morcar loves me. To the gen'rous mind</l>
<l>The heaviest debt is that of gratitude,</l>
<l>When 'tis not in our power to repay it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>Oft' have I heard thee say, to him thou ow'st</l>
<l>Thy honour and thy life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>I told thee truth.</l>
<l>Beneath my father's hospitable roof,</l>
<l>I spent my earlier happier days in peace</l>
<l>And safety: When the Norman conqu'ror came,</l>
<l>Discord, thou know'st, soon lit her fatal torch,</l>
<l>And spread destruction o'er this wretched land.</l>
<l>The loyal Ranulph flew to William's aid,</l>
<l>And left me to a faithful peasant's care,</l>
<l>Who liv'd, sequester'd, in the fertile plains</l>
<l>Of rich Northumbria: There awhile I dwelt</l>
<l>In sweet retirement, when the savage Malcolm</l>
<l>Rush'd on our borders.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>I remember well</l>
<l>The melancholy hour. Confusion rag'd</l>
<l>On ev'ry side, and desolation spread</l>
<l>Its terrors round us. How did'st thou escape?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>A crew of desp'rate ruffians seiz'd upon me,</l>
<l>A helpless prey: For, O! he was not there,</l>
<l>Who best cou'd have defended his Matilda.</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="10"/>
Then had I fall'n a wretched sacrifice</l>
<l>To rbutal rage, and lawless violence,</l>
<l>Had not the gen'rous Morcar interpos'd</l>
<l>To save me: Tho' he join'd the guilty cause</l>
<l>Of foul rebellion, yet his soul abhor'd</l>
<l>Such violation. At his awful voice</l>
<l>The surly ruffians left me, and retir'd.</l>
<l>He bore me, half expiring in his arms,</l>
<l>Back to his tent; with ev'ry kind attention</l>
<l>There strove to sooth my griefs, and promis'd, soon</l>
<l>As fit occasion offer'd, to restore me</l>
<l>To my afflicted father.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>Something sure</l>
<l>Was due to gen'rous Morcar for his aid,</l>
<l>So timely given.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>No doubt: But mark what follow'd.</l>
<l>In my deliverer too soon I found</l>
<l>An ardent lover, sighing at my feet.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>And what is there the proudest of our sex</l>
<l>Cou'd wish for more? To be the envy'd bride</l>
<l>Of noble Morcar, first of England's peers,</l>
<l>In fame and fortune.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Never trust, my Bertha,</l>
<l>To outward shew. 'Tis not the smiles of fortune,</l>
<l>The pomp of wealth, or splendor of a court,</l>
<l>Can make us happy. In the mind alone,</l>
<l>Rests solid joy, and true felicity,</l>
<l>Which I can never taste: For, O, my friend!</l>
<l>A secret sorrow weighs upon my heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="11"/>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>Then pour it in the bosom of thy friend;</l>
<l>Let me partake it with thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Gen'rous maid!</l>
<l>Know then, for nought will I conceal from thee,</l>
<l>I honour Mercia's Earl, revere his virtues,</l>
<l>And wish I cou'd repay him with myself;</l>
<l>But, blushing, I acknowledge it, the heart</l>
<l>His vows solicit, is not mine to give.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>Has then Tome happier youth—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Another time</l>
<l>I'll tell thee all the story of our loves.</l>
<l>But, O, my Bertha! did'st thou know to whom</l>
<l>My virgin faith is plighted, thou wou'd'st say</l>
<l>I am indeed unhappy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>Cou'd Matilda</l>
<l>Bestow the treasure of her heart on one</l>
<l>Unworthy of her choice?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Unworthy! No.</l>
<l>I glory in my passion for the best,</l>
<l>The loveliest of his sex. O! he was all</l>
<l>That bounteous nature, prodigal of charms,</l>
<l>Did on her choicest fav'rite e'er bestow.</l>
<l>His graceful form and sweet deportment spoke</l>
<l>The fairer beauties of his kindred soul,</l>
<l>Where e'vry grace and ev'ry virtue shone.</l>
<l>But thou wilt tremble, Bertha, when I tell thee,</l>
<l>He is Earl Morcar's—brother.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="12"/>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>Ha! his brother!</l>
<l>The noble Edwin! Often have I heard</l>
<l>My father—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Did Lord Edrick know him then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>He knew his virtues, and his fame in arms,</l>
<l>And often wou'd lament the dire effects</l>
<l>Of civil discord, that cou'd thus dissolve</l>
<l>The ties of nature, and of brethren make</l>
<l>The bitt'rest foes. If right I learn, Lord Edwin</l>
<l>Is William's firmest friend, and still supports</l>
<l>His royal master.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Yes, my Bertha, there</l>
<l>I still find comfort: Edwin ne'er was stain'd</l>
<l>As Morcar is, with foul disloyalty,</l>
<l>But stands betwixt his sov'reign and the rage</l>
<l>Of rebel multitudes, to guard his throne.</l>
<l>If nobly fighting in his country's cause,</l>
<l>My hero falls, I shall not weep alone;</l>
<l>The king he lov'd and honour'd, will lament him,</l>
<l>And grateful England mix her tears with mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>And doth Earl Morcar know of Edwin's love?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>O, no! I wou'd not for a thousand worlds</l>
<l>He shou'd suspect it, lest his fiery soul</l>
<l>Shou'd catch th' alarm, and kindle to a flame</l>
<l>That might destroy us all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>I know his warmth</l>
<l>And vehemence of temper, unrestrain'd</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="13"/>
By laws, and spurning at the royal pow'r</l>
<l>Which he contemns, he rules despotic here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Alas! how man from man, and brother oft</l>
<l>From brother differs! Edwin's tender passion</l>
<l>Is soft and gentle as the balmy breath</l>
<l>Of vernal zephyrs; whilst the savage north,</l>
<l>That curls the angry ocean into storms,</l>
<l>Is a faint image of Earl Morcar's love:</l>
<l>'Tis rage, 'tis fury all. When last we met</l>
<l>He knit his angry brow, and frown'd severe</l>
<l>Upon me; then, with wild distracted look,</l>
<l>Bade me beware of trifling with his passion,</l>
<l>He wou'd not brook it—trembling I retir'd,</l>
<l>And bath'd my couch in tears.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>Unhappy maid!</l>
<l>But time, that softens ev'ry human woe,</l>
<l>Will bring some blest event, and lighten thine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Alas! thou know'st not what it is to love.</l>
<l>Haply thy tender heart hath never felt</l>
<l>The tortures of that soul-bewitching passion.</l>
<l>Its joys are sweet and poignant, but its pangs</l>
<l>Are exquisite, as I have known too well:</l>
<l>For, O! my Bertha, since the fatal hour</l>
<l>When Edwin left me, never hath sweet peace,</l>
<l>That us'd to dwell with all its comforts here,</l>
<l>'E'er deign'd to visit this afflicted breast.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>Too plain, alas! I read thy sorrows; grief</l>
<l>Sits in sad triumph on thy faded cheek,</l>
<l>And half obscures the lustre of thy beauties.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="14" ana="y"/>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Talk not of beauty, 'tis our sex's bane,</l>
<l>And leads but to destruction. I abhor</l>
<l>The fatal gift. O! would it had pleas'd heav'n</l>
<l>To brand my homely features with the mark</l>
<l>Of foul deformity, or let me pass</l>
<l>Unknown, and undistinguish'd from the herd</l>
<l>Of vulgar forms, save by the partial eye</l>
<l>Of my lov'd Edwin; then had I been blest</l>
<l>With charms unenvy'd, and a guiltless love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>Where is thy Edwin now?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Alas! I know not.</l>
<l>'Tis now three years since last these eyes beheld</l>
<l>Their dearest object. In that humble vale,</l>
<l>Whence, as I told thee, Malcolm's fury drove me,</l>
<l>There first we met. O! how I cherish still</l>
<l>The fond remembrance! There we first exchang'd</l>
<l>Our mutual vows, the day of happiness</l>
<l>Was fixt; it came, and in a few short hours</l>
<l>He had been made indissolubly mine,</l>
<l>When fortune, envious of our happiness,</l>
<l>And William's danger, call'd him to the field.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>And since that parting have ye never met?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>O never, Bertha, never but in thought.</l>
<l>Imagination, kind anticipator</l>
<l>Of love's pleasures, brings us oft' together.</l>
<l>Oft' as I sit within my lonely tent,</l>
<l>And cast my wishful eyes o'er yonder plain,</l>
<l>In ev'ry passing traveller I strive</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="15"/>
To trace his image, hear his lovely voice</l>
<l>In ev'ry sound, and fain wou'd flatter me</l>
<l>Edwin still lives, still loves his lost Matilda.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
<l>Who knows but fate, propitious to thy love,</l>
<l>May guide him hither.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Gracious heav'n forbid!</l>
<l>Consider, Bertha, if the chance of war</l>
<l>Shou'd this way lead him, he must come in arms</l>
<l>Against his brother: Oh! 'tis horrible</l>
<l>To think on. Shou'd they meet, and Edwin fall,</l>
<l>What shall support me? And if vict'ry smiles</l>

<l>When the impetuous Morcar scatters fear</l>

<l>Ha! in tears,</l>

<l>Thy gentle spirit?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Canst thou ask the cause,</l>

<l>A wretched captive, friendless and forlorn,</l>
<l>Without one ray of hope to sooth my sorrows.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Can she, whose beauteous form, and fair demeanor,</l>
<l>Charm ev'ry eye, and conquer ev'ry heart,</l>

<l>Whom Siward honours, and whom Morcar loves?</l>
<l>O! if thou knew'st with what unceasing ardor,</l>
<l>What unexampled tenderness and truth,</l>

<l>At least to pity.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Urge no more, my Lord,</l>
<l>Th' ungrateful subject; but too well I know</l>
<l>How much thy friend deserves, how much, alas,</l>
<l>I owe him!—If it be Earl Morcar's wish</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="17"/>
To make me happy, why am I detain'd</l>
<l>A pris'ner here: Spight of his solemn promise</l>
<l>He would restore me to my royal master,</l>
<l>Or send me back to the desiring arms</l>
<l>Of the afflicted Ranulph, who in tears</l>
<l>Of bitt'rest anguish, mourns his long-lost daughter?</l>
<l>Surely, my Lord, it ill becomes a soldier</l>
<l>To forfeit thus his honor and his word.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>I own it; yet the cause pleads strongly for him.</l>
<l>If by thy own too pow'rful charms misled,</l>
<l>He deviates from the paths of rigid honour,</l>
<l>Matilda might forgive. Thou know'st he lives</l>
<l>But in thy smiles; his love-enchanted soul</l>
<l>Hangs on those beauties he wou'd wish to keep</l>
<l>For ever in his sight.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Indulgent heav'n</l>
<l>Keep me for ever from it! O, my Lord!</l>
<l>If e'er thy heart with gen'rous pity glow'd</l>
<l>For the distress'd; if e'er thy honest zeal</l>
<l>Cou'd boast an influence o'er the man you love;</l>
<l>O! now exert thy pow'r, assist, direct,</l>
<l>And save thy friend from ruin and Matilda.</l>
<l>There are, my Lord, who most offend, where most</l>
<l>They wish to please. Such often is the fate</l>
<l>Of thy unhappy friend, when he pours forth</l>
<l>His ardent soul in vows of tend'rest passion;</l>
<l>'Tis with such rude and boist'rous violence</l>
<l>As suits but ill the hero or the lover.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>I know his weakness, know his follies all,</l>
<l>And feel 'em but too well: He loves with transport,</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="18"/>
And hates with fury. Warm'd with fierce desire,</l>
<l>Or strong resentment, his impetuous soul</l>
<l>Is hurried on, 'till reason quits her seat,</l>
<l>And passion takes the loosely-flowing rein;</l>
<l>Then all is rage, confusion, and despair.</l>
<l>And yet, when cool reflections hath remov'd</l>
<l>The veil of error, he will weep his faults</l>
<l>With such a sweet contrition, as wou'd melt</l>
<l>The hardest heart to pity and forgiveness.</l>
<l>O! he has virtues that may well attone</l>
<l>For all his venial rashness, that deserve</l>
<l>A sov'reign's love, and claim a nation's praise;</l>
<l>Virtues that merit happiness and thee.</l>
<l>Why wilt thou thus despise my noble friend?</l>
<l>His birth and fortune, with the rank he bears</l>
<l>Amongst the first of England's peers, will raise thee</l>
<l>As far above thy sex, in wealth and pow'r,</l>
<l>As now thou art in beauty.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>O, my Lord!</l>
<l>'Tis not the pride, the luxury of life,</l>
<l>The splendid robe and glitt'ring gem, that knits</l>
<l>The lasting bonds of mutual happiness:</l>
<l>Where manners differ, where affections jarr,</l>
<l>And will not kindly mix together, where</l>
<l>The sweet harmonious concord of the mind</l>
<l>Is wanting, all is misery and woe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>By heav'n, thou plead'st thy own and virtue's cause,</l>
<l>With such bewitching eloquence, the more</l>
<l>Thy heart, alarm'd by diffidence, still urges</l>

<l>The fair perfections you already see,</l>

<l>That must for ever dis-unite us—Born</l>
<l>Of Norman race, and from my earliest years</l>
<l>Attach'd to William's cause; I love my king</l>
<l>And wish my country's peace: That king, my Lord,</l>
<l>Whom Morcar wishes to dethrone; that peace</l>
<l>Which he destroys: Had he an angel's form,</l>
<l>With all the virtues that adorn his sex,</l>
<l>With all the riches fortune can bestow,</l>
<l>I wou'd not wed a traitor.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Call not his errors by so harsh a name;</l>
<l>He has been deeply wrong'd, and souls like his,</l>
<l>Must feel the wounds of honour, and resent them,</l>
<l>Alas! with thee I weep my country's fate,</l>
<l>Nay wish, perhaps, as well to William's cause,</l>
<l>And England's peace, as can the loyal daughter</l>
<l>Of gallant Ranulph, and wou'd, therefore, joy</l>
<l>To see Matilda lend a gracious ear</l>
<l>To Morcar's suit. Thy reconciling charms</l>
<l>Might sooth his troubled soul, might heal the wounds</l>

<l>I thank you for your council. 'Tis th'advice</l>

Of cold unfeeling wisdom, kindly meant</l>
<l>To make me prudent, and to leave me wretched:</l>

<l>For pain and sickness which it never knew.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>There too thou err'st; for I have known its joys</l>
<l>And sorrows too. In early life I lost</l>
<l>The partner of my soul. E'er since that hour</l>
<l>I bade adieu to love, and taught my soul</l>
<l>To offer her devotions at the shrine</l>

<l>A victor's claim, and force her to be happy.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Inexorable.</l>
<l>So I have heard, and therefore little hope</l>
<l>To change his nature. O! cou'd he be wrought</l>
<l>To sweet oblivion of his wrongs; to bury</l>
<l>His deep resentment: Mine shou'd be the task,</l>
<l>A task, heav'n knows, I wou'd with joy perform,</l>
<l>To reconcile offended majesty:</l>
<l>To soften all his errors, plead his pardon,</l>

<l>For ev'ry moment I expect him here:</l>
<l>Thy freedom and thy happiness shall be</l>

<l>Thanks to thy friendly aid.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>We must not boast;</l>
<l>'Twas hardly purchas'd, and has cost us dear:</l>
<l>You follow'd 'em too close.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>I own 'twas rash;</l>
<l>My youthful ardor urg'd the keen pusuit</l>
<l>Too far; and but for thee I had been lost.</l>
<l>In war, thy arm protects me, and in peace,</l>
<l>Thy councils guide. O! how shall I return</l>
<l>Thy goodness? Thou wer't born to save thy friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Away. I'll not be thank'd. I've done my duty,</l>
<l>And if thou think'st thyself indebted for it,</l>
<l>Repay me not with flatt'ry, but with love.</l>
<l>E'er since my soul with thine, congonial met</l>
<l><pb n="25" facs="32"/>
In social bands, and mark'd thee for her own,</l>
<l>Thy int'rest and thy happiness have been</l>
<l>My first ambition; and when thou art blest</l>
<l>With all thy soul can wish for, Siward then,</l>
<l>And then alone, will have his full reward.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>O, unexampled faithfulness and truth!</l>
<l>But say, my Siward, is our loss so great?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>The flow'r of half our troops. But 'tis not now</l>
<l>A time to weep, for I have glorious tidings,</l>
<l>That much import thy happiness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Ha! what?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Know that amongst our captives I have ta'en</l>
<l>A noble prize, will make us full amends</l>
<l>For ev'ry loss—the gallant Ranulph.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Ha!</l>
<l>Matilda's father! then I'm satisfy'd.</l>
<l>The wily chief! by heav'n he shall repay me</l>
<l>For her unkindness: Give him to my rage,</l>
<l>To my resentment, to my injur'd love.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>I have set him free,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Ha! free! Thy ill-tim'd metey hath betray'd</l>
<l>Our cause. The tyrant wou'd have ransom'd him</l>
<l>With half his kingdom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Still thy rapid passions</l>
<l>O'erpow'r thy reason. What if it shou'd serve</l>
<l><pb n="26" facs="33"/>
A better purpose; smooth thy paths to bliss,</l>
<l>And gain Matilda for thee!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>O, my friend!</l>
<l>My Siward, do not flatter me: By heav'n,</l>
<l>Her kind consent wou'd give my ravish'd soul</l>
<l>More true and heart-felt happiness than cou'd</l>
<l>A thousand vict'ries o'er the proud usurper.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Know then, I gave him liberty and life</l>
<l>On these conditions—That he shou'd with-draw</l>
<l>His pow'rs from William's aid, and never more</l>
<l>Assist his cause; the time wou'd come, I told him,</l>
<l>That he shou'd know to whom he ow'd the boon,</l>
<l>And how he might repay it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>That was kind,</l>
<l>Indeed, my Siward, that was like a friend.</l>
<l>O! thou reviv'st my drooping heart; but tell me</l>
<l>Did my Matilda, let me call her mine,</l>
<l>Did she acknowledge, did she thank thee for it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>O! I assum'd no merit; but to thee,</l>
<l>And to thy gen'rous, unexampled love</l>
<l>Did I attribute all. She sigh'd, and wept,</l>
<l>Pour'd forth a thousand blessings on thy head—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>And do'st thou think, my Siward, that one ray</l>
<l>Of hope remains?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>The clouds already vanish,</l>
<l>The prospect brightens round thee; haste and seize</l>
<l>The lucky moment. When the gen'rous mind</l>
<l>Is sooth'd by obligation, soon it opens</l>
<l><pb n="27" facs="34"/>
To the mild dictates of humanity,</l>
<l>And softens into sympathy and love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>O, Siward! cou'd'st thou teach me but to win</l>
<l>That lovely maid—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>The task is half perform'd</l>
<l>Already, and my friend shall soon be bless'd.</l>
<l>One thing, and one alone, remains to fix</l>
<l>Her doubtful heart, if yet a doubt remains.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>O! name it, Siward; if 'tis in the pow'r</l>
<l>Of wealth to purchase, or of victory</l>
<l>In the fair field of glory to acquire,</l>
<l>It shall not long be wanting.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>It requires</l>
<l>No price, but such as Morcar well can pay;</l>
<l>No vict'ry, but the vict'ry o'er thyself,</l>
<l>And thy own passions—Give up thy resentment,</l>
<l>Make peace with William, and Matilda's thine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Matilda mine! and must I purchase her</l>
<l>At the dear price of honour? with the loss</l>
<l>Of all my soul holds dear, my country's welfare?</l>
<l>My word—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Away! whilst prudence warranted</l>
<l>Our honest zeal, I was the first to aid</l>
<l>Thy just revenge; but valour ill-advis'd,</l>
<l>And ill-exerted in a hopeless cause,</l>
<l>Degen'rate into rashness. You mistake</l>
<l>The pride of honour, for the pride of virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>And wou'd'st thou have me bend beneath the yoke</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>I'd have thee just and happy—We have been</l>
<l>Successful, let us now be generous,</l>
<l>Whilst we have something to bestow; nor wait</l>
<l>'Till fickle fortune from our brows shall tear</l>
<l>The blasted wreath, and leave us nought to give.</l>
<l>Too long already have we sacrific'd</l>
<l>At proud ambition's altar, to revenge;</l>
<l>Now let us offer at the shrine of peace,</l>
<l>And sacrifice—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>To love, and to Matilda;</l>
<l>It shall be so—the struggle's past—away,</l>
<l>My Siward, haste, and tell her, I obey;</l>
<l>Her laws, her king, her master shall be mine;</l>
<l>I have no will but her's, and in her eyes</l>
<l>Will read my duty—Yet a moment stay,</l>
<l>What will my brave companions of the war,</l>

<l>This unexpected change?</l>

<l>Prevents my ev'ry wish—But say, my friend,</l>
<l><pb n="29" facs="36"/>
Where is the gallant chief whom we subdu'd,</l>
<l>Who fought so hardly, and so nobly fell?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>In yonder tent, a wretched pris'ner still,</l>
<l>He counts the tedious hours; a heavy gloom</l>
<l>Sits on his brow, as if some deep-felt sorrow</l>
<l>Oppress'd his noble mind—We must release him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Thou know'st, my Siward, thrice we had o'erpow'r'd</l>
<l>His troops, and thrice his single valour turn'd</l>
<l>The fortune of the day: Since first I trod</l>
<l>The paths of glory, ne'er did I behold</l>
<l>Such deeds of valour wrought by mortal hand;</l>
<l>I almost envy'd, tho' I conquer'd him.</l>
<l>He wore his beaver up, nor cou'd I trace</l>
<l>His features, but he bears a noble form:</l>
<l>Know'st thou his quality or name?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Not yet;</l>
<l>He seems industrious to conceal them both</l>
<l>From ev'ry eye.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Some deity protects him,</l>
<l>As its peculiar care, for as I rais'd</l>
<l>My sword against him, whether the soft passion</l>
<l>That triumphs o'er me, had unmann'd my soul,</l>
<l>I know not; but, bereft of all its pow'r,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>'Tis most true, I saw</l>
<l>And wonder'd at it. When you lest the field,</l>

And seem'd to court his fate, till circling foes</l>

<l>Yes,</l>

<l>Than fancy ever form'd; 'twas real all;</l>
<l>It haunts me still, and ev'ry circumstance</l>

<l>Scarce had I clos'd my eyes, to seek that rest</l>

<l>The mournful image of my wretched state:</l>

<l>At the unequal conflict, darted forth</l>

<l>Thou wilt not call me cruel or unkind,</l>
<l>When I shall tell thee I am come to claim</l>
<l>Another's right, O! heav'n, another's right</l>

<l>Yes, ev'n now</l>
<l>We parted.—Here he told me I should meet</l>
<l>A beauteous captive; little did I think</l>
<l>It was Matilda, whom he long had woo'd;</l>
<l>Whose gen'rous heart, he hop'd, wou'd now accept</l>
<l>A convert made to loyalty by love;</l>
<l>She only waited for that blest event,</l>
<l>With mutual ardour to return his passion.</l>

<l>Confirms it but too well.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Appearance oft,</l>
<l>By strange events and causeless jealousy,</l>
<l>Confounds the guilty with the innocent.</l>
<l>But sure my Edwin's noble mind disdains</l>
<l>To cherish low suspicion; 'tis a vice</l>
<l>Abhorrent to thy nature, and Matilda</l>
<l>Will never practice it on thee. True love</l>
<l>Knows not distrust, or diffidence, but rests</l>
<l>On its own faith secure, and hopes to meet</l>
<l>The truth it merits.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="40" facs="47"/>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>

<l>Mistaken man!</l>
<l>Cou'dst thou e'er credit the delusive tale?</l>
<l>Cou'dst thou believe I had so soon forgot</l>
<l>My plighted faith? But since I am suspected,</l>
<l>Return, and bear this answer back to Morcar.</l>
<l>First say, I thank him for the choice he made</l>
<l>Of thee to be the herald of his love:</l>
<l>For what is there Matilda can refuse,</l>
<l>That Edwin could request?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>O! that recalls</l>
<l>A thousand tender thoughts—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Go tell him too,</l>
<l>What e'er I rashly promis'd but to gain</l>
<l>A few short moments, to preserve my king,</l>
<l>And save a father's life, I never meant</l>
<l>To feign a passion which I coud not feel;</l>
<l>For I was destin'd to another's arms;</l>
<l>To one, who now regardless of his vows</l>
<l>To poor Matilda, after three long years</l>
<l>Of cruel absence from her, comes at last</l>
<l>To doubt her honor, and suspect her love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>O! never, never. Sooner will I doubt</l>
<l>The pow'rs of nature, and believe these eyes</l>
<l>Can misinterpret ev'ry object here,</l>
<l>Than think thee false. O! take me to thy arms</l>
<l>And bury all my doubts.—Can'st thou forgive</l>
<l>The jealous warmth of agonizing passion?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="41" facs="48"/>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>I can; I must. But say, to what blest chance</l>
<l>Am I indebted for this happy moment?</l>

<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>The chance of war. I am a pris'ner here,</l>
<l>And but for thee—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>When I shall tell thee all</l>
<l>That I have suffer'd since we parted last</l>
<l>Thou wilt not blame, but pity poor Matilda.</l>
<l>Mean while be calm; it is not now a time</l>
<l>For idle doubts and visionary fears</l>
<l>When real dangers threat. I see already,</l>
<l>By thy imperfect tale, what misery</l>
<l>Must soon await us, when the fiery Earl</l>
<l>Shall know this strange event.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>And wherefore know it?</l>
<l>Why not conceal our passion, till some means</l>
<l>Of freedom offer?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>I abhor the thought.</l>
<l>No, Edwin, no. The crisis of our fate</l>
<l>Approaches. Never let us stain our loves</l>
<l>With crooked fraud and base dissimulation.</l>
<l>Hark! did'st thou hear a voice in yonder grove?</l>
<l>Siward in conf'rence with the haughty Earl;</l>
<l>Behold them—see—they part—and Morcar hastes,</l>
<l>With quick impatient step, to know his fate.</l>
<l>Now summon all thy pow'rs.</l>

<l>At length I hope Matilda's satisfy'd.</l>
<l>Edwin has told thee what a sacrifice</l>
<l>My heart hath made. Ambition, glory, pride,</l>
<l>And fierce resentment bend beneath thy pow'r,</l>
<l>And yield the palm to all-subduing love.</l>
<l>Yes, thou hast conquer'd. I am William's friend;</l>
<l>The struggle's past. I have perform'd the task</l>
<l>Assign'd, and come to claim my just reward.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>By virtuous acts the self-approving mind</l>
<l>Is amply paid, nor seeks a recompence</l>
<l>From ought beside. You have redeem'd your honor,</l>
<l>Turn'd to the paths of duty, and discharg'd</l>
<l>The debt you owe your country, and your king:</l>
<l>England and William will be grateful for it.</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>There is a prize,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>The good and just, my lord, demand our praise,</l>
<l>And gen'rous deeds will claim the tribute due,</l>
<l>The debt of humble gratitude; but love,</l>
<l>Love, that must mark the colour of our days</l>
<l>For good or ill, for happiness or woe,</l>
<l>'Tis not the gift of fortune, or of fame,</l>
<l>Nor earn'd by merit, nor acquir'd by virtue.</l>
<l>All the rich treasures, which, or wealth, or pow'r</l>
<l>Have to bestow, can never purchase that</l>
<l>Which the free heart alone itself must give.</l>

<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Give it with freedom then to him who most</l>
<l>Hath study'd to deserve—</l>

<l>You talk, my Lord,</l>

<l>A right more precious, and a dearer claim;</l>
<l>But know, for now 'tis time to throw aside</l>

<l>To feel for others mis'ries, pity mine,</l>
<l>And poor Matilda's: She has not deserv'd</l>
<l>A fate like this.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Alas! it rives my soul</l>
<l>To see the tender bonds of amity</l>
<l>Thus torn asunder by the very means,</l>
<l>I fondly thought for ever wou'd unite them;</l>
<l>And the fair structure, which my hopes had rais'd,</l>
<l>Of love and friendship, in a moment shrunk</l>
<l>From its weak base, and bury'd all in ruin.</l>
<l>If thou can'st prove thy innocence, as yet</l>
<l>I hope thou wilt, for in that noble mien</l>
<l>I read a conscious pride, that wou'd not stoop</l>
<l>To ought that's base—Still may I hope to heal</l>
<l>These bleeding wounds, and sooth him to forgiveness.</l>
<l>Mean time be free. Give me thy sacred word,</l>
<l>The soldier's oath, thou wilt be found when e'er</l>
<l>I call upon thee; and yon tent alone</l>
<l>Shall be thy prison; free to range around,</l>
<l>Far as my guard extends.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Accept my thanks,</l>
<l>The humble tribute of a grateful heart;</l>
<l>'Tis all I have to give. The time may come</l>
<l>When Edwin shall repay thee as he ought.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Is there ought more, which honour, and the duty</l>
<l>I owe my friend permits me to bestow,</l>
<l>That thou wou'd'st ask?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="51" facs="60"/>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>O, grant me to behold</l>
<l>That injur'd maid, to take my last farewel;</l>
<l>Then act as fate and Morcar shall determine.</l>
<l>I give the pledge of safety thou requir'st,</l>
<l>And will be found—speak, wilt thou listen to me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Of that we'll talk hereafter—come—within</l>
<l>I'll hear thy story—Thou but know'st me yet</l>
<l>As Morcar's friend; hereafter thou may'st find</l>
<l>I am still more the friend—of truth and virtue.</l>

<head>ACT IV.</head>
<head>[SCENE, <stage>An Apartment belonging to SIWARD, opening to a wood.</stage></head>
<stage>EDWIN, MATILDA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>THANKS to the noble Siward's gen'rous pity</l>
<l>For the distress'd; once more we meet, Matilda,</l>
<l>But only meet, alas! to mourn our fate,</l>
<l>To feel each others woes, and to be wretched.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Eternal blessings wait on him who thus</l>
<l>Cou'd sweeten sorrow's bitter draught, and make</l>
<l>Captivity a blessing! O, my Edwin!</l>
<l>A few short moments spent with those we love,</l>
<l>Is worth an age of common life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>With thee</l>
<l>Indeed it is; but we are on the verge</l>
<l>Of a dark precipice, and ev'ry step</l>
<l>Is dangerous. If Morcar shou'd return,</l>
<l>And find us here together, we are lost</l>
<l>For ever; thou hast seen, and seen with horror,</l>
<l>The desp'rate rage of his tumultuous soul,</l>
<l>Let us avoid it, let us—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>What, my love?</l>
<l>Thou art my guide, protector, guardian, all</l>
<l><pb n="53" facs="62"/>
I have to boast on earth. O! teach me where</l>
<l>To find some blest asylum for my woes,</l>
<l>And guide my footsteps to the paths of peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Let me entreat thee then—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>O, speak! thou know'st</l>
<l>I have no will but thine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Then leave me, leave</l>
<l>This hated roof: I have a friend within,</l>
<l>Who shall conduct thee to the royal camp</l>
<l>In safety; bear this signet to the king,</l>
<l>He will protect thee, and what ever fate</l>
<l>Decrees for me, Matilda may be happy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>O! never, never: Safety dwells with thee,</l>
<l>And thee alone. Without my faithful Edwin,</l>
<l>The peopled city, and the crouded court,</l>
<l>Wou'd be a desart to me. No, my love,</l>
<l>We will not part: The same benignant pow'r</l>
<l>That led thee hither, that, beyond my hopes</l>
<l>Brought my lost Edwin to these arms again,</l>
<l>Will still protect that virtue which it loves.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Did'st thou not tell me, that this very morn</l>
<l>Thou had'st determin'd, as the only means</l>
<l>To shun my brother's love, on sudden flight?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>But then I shou'd have fled in search of thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Thou winning softness! how shall I reward</l>
<l>Such unexampled tenderness and truth!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="54" facs="63"/>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>By flying with me. Come, my love, lead on,</l>
<l>I'll follow thee to dangers and to death;</l>
<l>Nor perils shall affright, nor labours tire,</l>
<l>When thou art with me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>No: It must not be.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Why? What shou'd keep thee here?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>The ties of honour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>And are they stronger than the bonds of love?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>To Siward's kind indulgence, well thou know'st,</l>
<l>I owe this little interval of peace,</l>
<l>This transient gleam of happiness with thee;</l>
<l>And shou'd I break my sacred word, his life</l>
<l>Might answer for it; wou'd'st thou have me thus</l>
<l>Repay his kindness? No, my love; I may</l>
<l>Be wretched, but I cannot be ungrateful.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Must thou return then to that hateful prison</l>
<l>When Morcar comes?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>I must. O! think when I</l>
<l>Am pent within a loathsome dungeon, who</l>
<l>Shall shelter then thy unprotected virtue?</l>
<l>No Edwin there to succour thee: Who knows</l>
<l>What brutal lust and pow'r may dare to act,</l>
<l>On a deserted, beauteous, friendless woman?</l>
<l>Distracting thought! A monarch's vengeance then</l>
<l>Wou'd come too late; wou'd make me poor amends</l>
<l>For my Matilda's violated charms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="55" facs="64"/>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>He cannot be so mean, so base of soul,</l>
<l>Or if he shou'd, I have a dagger here</l>
<l>To save me from dishonour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>What! by death?</l>
<l>Dreadful alternative! O! hazard not</l>
<l>Thy precious life, but seize the lucky moment</l>
<l>Which fortune gives us, e'er it be too late.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Urge me no more; already I have felt,</l>
<l>Too deeply felt, the pangs of absence from thee;</l>
<l>Another separation wou'd be worse</l>
<l>Than death, and all its terrors. No, my love;</l>
<l>We are embark'd on a tumultuous sea,</l>
<l>And must abide the fury of the storm.</l>
<l>The waves of angry fortune <hi>may</hi> o'erwhelm</l>
<l>But <hi>shall not</hi> part us: We will stem the torrent,</l>
<l>Brave the proud ocean's rage, and gain the harbour</l>
<l>Of peace and happiness—or <hi>sink</hi> together.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Thou hast foretold the tempest, and behold</l>
<l>It rushes on us.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter MORCAR and HAROLD.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Ha! Earl Morcar here!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Harold, I thank thee; thy intelligence</l>
<l>Was but too true.</l>
<stage>(turning to Edwin.</stage>
<l>Traitor! who set thee free?</l>
<l>They wou'd have 'scap'd my vengeance—false Matilda!</l>
<l>'Tis thus I am rewarded for my love,</l>
<l><pb n="56" facs="65"/>
My ill-tim'd mercy to a thankless brother.</l>
<l>Back to thy dungeon, slave. Guards, drag him hence,</l>
<l>To prison, and to death.</l>
<stage>(to the soldiers.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Or death, or life,</l>
<l>Are equal to me, if I must be torn</l>
<l>From my Matilda. But, whate'er thy purpose,</l>
<l>Be speedy in thy vengeance, nor delay</l>
<l>The cruel work; for know, thy master comes,</l>
<l>William approaches—to revenge my cause.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>But not to save thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Then farewel, Matilda,</l>
<l>Perhaps for ever—If we meet no more</l>
<l>Thou wilt remember—But I will not doubt</l>
<l>Thy honour, or thy love. I know thy truth.</l>
<l>Know thou wilt act as best becomes thy fate,</l>
<l>Whate'er it be, and worthy of thyself.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Of <hi>thee,</hi> my Edwin, rather say of <hi>thee.</hi></l>
<l>Yes; I will copy well thy bright example;</l>
<l>I'll not disgrace thy love with woman's weakness,</l>
<l>But part without a tear. I will but stay</l>
<l>To tell thy tyrant brother how I hate,</l>
<l>How I despise him, and then follow thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>I'll hear no more—begone!—away with him.</l>
<stage>[Exeunt guards with Edwin.</stage>
<l>For thee, Matilda—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>What for me remains</l>
<l>I know too well; thy odious love, reproach</l>
<l>Unmerited, and threats which I despise.</l>
<l><pb n="57" facs="66"/>
Thou think'st I have deceiv'd thee—think so still.</l>
<l>Enjoy thy error. Thou believ'st us guilty;</l>
<l>'Twill make thee happy now—Perchance to find</l>
<l>Us innocent, may be thy punishment hereafter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Aye, 'twas a proof of innocence to fly,</l>
<l>Thou and thy paramour together.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>No;</l>
<l>I scorn a thought so mean. Cou'd I have left</l>
<l>My Edwin, long e'er this I might have been</l>
<l>Beyond the reach of tyranny; beyond</l>
<l>Thy hated pow'r; and safe beneath the wing</l>
<l>Of sacred majesty, in William's care.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>In William's care!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Thy conqueror's—for know</l>
<l>The hero comes—to scatter blessings round him,</l>
<l>To heal his country's wounds, chastise rebellion,</l>
<l>And punish false perfidious slaves like thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>By heav'ns! she braves my wrath, insults my weakness,</l>
<l>And triumphs o'er her slave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>There was a time,</l>
<l>When with an eye of pity, I beheld</l>
<l>Thy hopeless love; when I conceal'd my passion</l>
<l>For the dear idol of my heart, because</l>
<l>I fear'd 'twou'd make thee wretched; but thy rage,</l>
<l>Thy cruel treatment of a guiltless brother,</l>
<l>Has cancell'd all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="58" facs="67"/>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Then, mark me: If thou hop'st</l>
<l>For Edwin's freedom, shake off this vile passion;</l>
<l>Yield thy proud heart to him who best deserves it,</l>
<l>And meet me at the altar—Two hours hence</l>
<l>I shall expect thee there—Beyond that time</l>
<l>He may not live to thank thee for thy bounty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Then let him perish—glut thy tyrant soul</l>
<l>With vengeance: bathe it in a brother's blood,</l>
<l>All ruffian, all barbarian, as thou art,</l>
<l>Thou can'st not murder his immortal fame:</l>
<l>Thou can'st not rob him of Matilda's love.</l>
<l>But know—when he, for whom alone this pulse</l>
<l>Wou'd wish to beat, this lazy blood to flow</l>
<l>Within my veins, when he shall be no more;</l>
<l>Another life shall satiate thy revenge;</l>
<l>Another victim shall attend thy triumph.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Thou talk'st it nobly—'tis the common trick,</l>
<l>The affectation of thy sex to boast</l>
<l>A fancied firmness, which ye never knew;</l>
<l>But with affrighted nature thou wou'd'st shrink</l>
<l>When death approaches.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Put me to the proof.</l>
<l>If thou wou'd'st punish Edwin, know he lives</l>
<l>Within this breast—strike home, and pierce him there.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Imperious woman! thou defy'st my pow'r,</l>
<l>And let it crush thee. If thy country bleeds</l>
<l>In ev'ry vein; if perjur'd Edwin falls,</l>
<l>As soon he shall, a victim to my rage;</l>
<l><pb n="59" facs="68"/>
Thou art the murd'rer; thou the paricide:</l>
<l>I stand absolv'd; the guilt is all thy own.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>If it be guilt to suffer keen reproach,</l>
<l>Pain, persecution, terror, chains and death</l>
<l>For him I love, rather than stain my soul</l>
<l>With foul disloyalty, I am indeed</l>
<l>The guiltiest of my sex, and well deserve</l>
<l>The pangs I feel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Thou'st driv'n me to the pit</l>
<l>Of black despair, and I will drag thee down</l>
<l>To share the dreadful ruin thou hast made.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>I know thy savage purpose; but remember,</l>
<l>The hour approaches when thou shalt repent</l>
<l>This base, unmanly triumph. William comes:</l>
<l>Hear that and tremble, thou unnat'ral brother;</l>
<l>Nor rocks, nor caves shall hide thee from his vengeance;</l>
<l>Inglorious, and unpitied, shalt thou fall,</l>
<l>And after ages shall consign thy name</l>
<l>To endless scorn, and infamy immortal.</l>
<stage>[Exit Matilda.</stage>

<l>Inexorable judge! I stand condemn'd,</l>

<l>I bid adieu to love, and all his train</l>
<l>Of fond delusions—Vengeance! I am thine,</l>
<l>And thine alone: Thou daughter of despair!</l>
<l>Destructive goddess! come, possess my soul</l>
<l>With all thy terrors—Yes; it shall be so.</l>
<l>A few short hours are all that niggard fate</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>O, they have pierc'd too deep; ev'n thou, my friend,</l>

<l>Nature's first law, and I must stand acquitted.</l>
<l>The prudent Siward seem'd to hesitate,</l>

<l>How often has thy insolence oppos'd</l>
<l>Thy master and thy prince? how often dar'd</l>
<l>To thwart <hi>my</hi> will, and execute thy own:</l>

<l>And shed a brother's blood—thou cou'd'st obey me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIWARD.</speaker>
<l>Away! this is the trick of self-delusion,</l>
<l>The common cant of hypocrites, who rail</l>
<l>At others guilt, to mitigate their own?</l>
<l>I've been the mean, the servile instrument</l>
<l>Of thy base vengeance; but thou had'st prepar'd</l>
<l>Another, a low ruffian, to perform</l>

<l>And deep remorse, can wash my crimes away,</l>
<l>Let 'em be bury'd with me in oblivion,</l>
<l>And do not curse the memory of—Morcar.</l>
<stage>(turning to Edwin.</stage>
<l>O, Edwin! say, can'st thou forgive the crime</l>
<l>Of frantic love, of madness and despair?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>As in my latest hour from heav'n I hope</l>
<l>Its kind indulgence for my errors past,</l>
<l>Ev'n so, my brother, from my soul I pardon</l>
<l>And pity thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>Then I shall die in peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Talk not of death, my brother, thou must live</l>
<l>To see our happiness complete, to hear</l>
<l>My sweet Matilda pour forth all her heart</l>
<l>In rap'rous thanks to thee, and to thy friend;</l>
<l>And grateful Edwin bless thee for thy bounties.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MORCAR.</speaker>
<l>It must not be: I know too much already,</l>
<l>Of Morcar's weakness, and Matilda's pow'r</l>
<l>They are not to be trusted. No, my Edwin,</l>
<l>Morcar shall never interrupt thy joys.</l>
<l>Far from thy fight and from the haunts of men,</l>
<l>In some deep distant solitude retir'd,</l>
<l>To pious sorrow will I dedicate</l>
<l>My short remains of wretched life, and strive</l>
<l>To make my peace with heav'n and wrong'd Matilda.</l>
<l>And if perchance in after-times some bard,</l>
<l>Struck with the native horrors of my tale,</l>
<l>Shou'd bid th' historic muse record it—let him</l>
<l><pb n="79" facs="88"/>
By <hi>my</hi> example teach a future age,</l>
<l>The dire effects of loose, unbridled rage;</l>
<l>Teach thoughtless men their passions to controul,</l>
<l>And curb the sallies of th'impetuous soul,</l>
<l>Lest they experience worse than Morcar's woe,</l>
<l>Nor find a Siward—to prevent the blow.</l>
