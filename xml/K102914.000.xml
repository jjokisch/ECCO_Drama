<p>THE UPHOLSTERER, OR What NEWS? A FARCE, In Two ACTS. As it is Performed at the THEATRE ROYAL▪ IN <hi>DRURY-LANE.</hi></p>

<pb n="i" facs="2"/>
<head><hi>To Mr.</hi> GARRICK.</head>
<opener><salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>THE UPHOLSTERER would be a <hi>Bankrupt</hi> even in thanks, could he think of going abroad into the World, without making his Compliments to Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> for the Civilities he has shewn him. Whatever Figure the poor broken Politician might make before the Commissioners of Bankruptcy at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> you have taken care of his Appearance before the self-chosen Commissioners of Criticism, at the Theatre Royal, in <hi>Drury-Lane.</hi></p>
<p>I am not willing to flatter myself that you were drawn forth, on this occasion, by any extraordinary Touches in the capital Figure, or in the <hi>Accompagnements du Tableau.</hi> I rather suppose that you approved the Justness of the Design, than that you were an Admirer of the Colouring.</p>
<p>The Design, Sir, was conceived and executed long since, because the Author judged that something in this way might have a seasonable tendency to allay the Intemperance of too violent a Political Spirit, or at least to laugh it into good Humour: With the same view it was lately retouched, and given to Mr. <hi>Mossop,</hi> to be presented to the Public at his Benefit. And however Men of a serious Cast may depreciate Amusements of this nature, I shall never blush for having dedicated a few Hours to them, as I am of opinion that such-like Avocations will more profitably unbend the Mind from graver Studies, than the solitary Pleasures of the Recluse, or any of the more open Dissipations of Life.</p>
<p><pb n="ii" facs="3"/>
I am aware that you, will, very probably, recollect a Passage in a celebrated Writer<note n="*" place="foot"><hi>Montesquicu.</hi></note>, which may seem to render the scope of this little Piece somewhat questionable. <hi>Dans une Nation Libre</hi> saith he, <hi>Il est tres Souvent indiferent que les Particuliers Raisonnets bien ou mal il sufit qu'ils Raisonnent: de la sort la Liberte qui Garantit des Effets de ces memes Raisonnements.</hi> But you know that the Question here, is not concerning the indisputable Right of the People to canvass their national Concerns; but the vicious Excess of a propensity to Politics, when it gives a wrong Bias to the Mind, and is attended with Circumstances, which create the ridiculous Absurd. In this light it was considered by Mr. <hi>Addison,</hi> who tells us in the <hi>Tatler,</hi> <note n="|" place="foot"><hi>Vide Number</hi> 155. <hi>and</hi> 160.</note> that he designed his Paper for the Benefit of those Citizens, who live more in a Coffee-house, than in their Shops, and whose Thoughts are so taken up with the Affairs of the Allies, that they forget their Customers. For the very same Species of People, the <hi>Upholsterer</hi> was brought on the Stage, being perhaps as proper an Object of Ridicule, as modern I de as and Manners will afford.</p>
<p>With regard to the Execution, I shall not detain you any longer on that head, than to remark that to preserve the Gravity, which is a specific Quality in Mr. <hi>Addison</hi>'s fine vein of Humour, has been my Endeavour throughout the Whole; though I am not insensible that grave Humour is sometimes dangerous on the Stage. In the principal Character I considered myself rather describing a <hi>Passion</hi> than a <hi>Man;</hi> and this you remember is mentioned by an excellent Critic, <note n="‡" place="foot">Mr. <hi>Hurd.</hi></note> to belong to the Province of Farce. For this Reason the UPHOLSTERER'S
<pb n="iii" facs="4"/>
Scenes are strongly tinctured with his predominant Foible; and as this Foible is generally fed and inflamed by a swarm of political Writers, I judged it coincident with my Plan, to expose the Duplicity of their Conduct, by introducing the Character of PAMPHLET.</p>
<p>This Character I have had the pleasure of seeing set off with all the exquisite Strokes of so fine a Comic Genius as Mr. GARRICK'S, without being indebted for Success to the Aid of personal Satire, having entirely levelled it against those, who are the ready Mercenaries of all Parties; and with all such I have the Happiness not to be acquainted.</p>
<p>I could here enlarge in the just Praise of Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> Mr. <hi>Yates,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Clive, &amp;c.</hi> but I have already deviated too far from the Purpose, I set out with; which was not to inscribe a Farce to you, for neither of us thinks so highly of these Matters; nor to become your Panegyrist, for your extended Reputation does not stand in need of it. My Intention was to embrace a public Opportunity of subscribing myself.</p>

<l><hi>Of a new Monarchy to form the Plan;</hi></l>
<l><hi>Each</hi> Greek—(<hi>as fam'd</hi> Demosthenes <hi>relates</hi>)</l>
<l><hi>Politically mad!—wou'd rave of states!</hi></l>
<l><hi>And help'd to form, where'er the Mob could meet,</hi></l>
<l><hi>An</hi> Areopagus <hi>in ev'ry, Street.</hi></l>
<l><hi>What News, what News was their eternal cry?</hi></l>
<l><hi>Is</hi> Philip <hi>sick!</hi> <note n="*" place="foot">Vide the first Philippic.</note>—<hi>then soar'd their Spirits high,</hi>—</l>
<l>Philip <hi>is well!—dejection in each Eye.</hi></l>
<l>Athenian <hi>Coblers join'd in deep debate,</hi></l>
<l><hi>While Gold in secret undermin'd the State;</hi></l>
<l><hi>Till wisdom's Bird the Vultur's prey was made;</hi></l>
<l><hi>And the Sword gleam'd in</hi> Academus' <hi>Shade.</hi></l>

<l><hi>Now modern</hi> Philips <hi>threaten this our Land,</hi></l>
<l><hi>What say</hi> Britannia's <hi>Sons?—along the Strand</hi></l>
<l><hi>What News ye cry?—with the same passion smit;</hi></l>
<l><hi>And there at least you rival Attic Wit.</hi></l>
<l><hi>A Parliament of Porters here shall muse</hi></l>
<l><hi>On State Affairs—"swall' wing a Taylor's News,"</hi></l>
<l><hi>For</hi> ways and means <hi>no starv'd Projector sleeps;</hi></l>

<p>As I am a Sinner, Sir, I only meant—</p>

<p>Only meant! You cou'd not mean it, Jackanapes,—you had no Meaning, Booby.—</p>

<p>Why, no, Sir,—that's the very Thing, Sir,—I had no Meaning.</p>

<p>Then Sirrah, I'll make you know your Meaning for the future.—</p>

<p>Yes, Sir,—to be sure, Sir,—and yet upon my Word if you would be but a little cool, Sir, you'd find I am not much to blame.—Besides Master, you can't conceive the good it would do your Health, if you will but keep your Temper a little.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Mighty well Sir, give your Advice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRISK.</speaker>
<p>Why really now this same Love hath metamorphosed us both very strangely, Master,—for to be free; here have we been at this Work these six Weeks,—stark-staring mad in Love with a Couple of Baggages not worth a Groat,—and yet Heaven help us! they have as much Pride as comes to the Share of a Lady of Quality before she has been caught in the Fact with a handsome young Fellow,—or indeed after she has been caught for that Matter.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>You won't have done Rascal.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRISK.</speaker>
<p>In short, my young Mistress and her Maid have as much Pride and Poverty as—as—no Matter what, they have the Devil and all,—when at the same Time every Body knows the old broken Upholsterer Miss <hi>Harriet</hi>'s Father, might give us all he has in the World, and not eat the worse Pudding on a Sunday for it.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>ROVE.</speaker>
<p>Ten Thousand Pounds had better play about her Pocket.—What Fortune has she?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRISK.</speaker>
<p>Heaven help us, not much to crack of.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Not much to crack of Mr. <hi>Brazen,</hi>—prithee <hi>Rovewell,</hi> how can you be so ungenerous as to ask such a Question? You know I don't mind Fortune, though by the Way she has an Uncle who is determin'd to settle very handsomely on her; and on the Strength of that, does she give herself innumerable Airs.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROVE.</speaker>
<p>Fortune not to be minded!—I'll tell you what <hi>Bellmour,</hi> tho' you have a good one already, there's no kind of Inconvenience in a little more,—I'm sure if I had not minded Fortune, I might have been in <hi>Jamaica</hi> still, not worth a Sugar-Cane; but the Widow <hi>Molosses</hi> took a Fancy to me;—Heaven, or a worse Destiny has taken a Fancy to her, and so after ten Years Exile, and being turn'd a-drist by my Father, here am I again a warm Planter, and a Widower, most woefully tir'd of Matrimony;—but my dear <hi>Bellmour</hi> we were both so overjoy'd to meet one another yesterday Evening, just as I arriv'd in Town, that I did not hear a Syllable from you of your Love Fit: How, when, and where did this happen?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="12"/>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Oh!—by the most fortunate Accident that ever was,—I'll tell thee <hi>Rovewell:</hi> I was going one Night from the Tavern about Six Weeks ago,—I had been there with a Parcel of Blades whose only Joy is center'd so their Bottle, and faith till this Accident I was no better myself,—but ever since I am grown quite a new Man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROVE.</speaker>
<p>Ay, a new Man indeed!—Who in the Name of Wonder would take thee, sunk as thou art into a musing, moping, melancholy Lover, for the gay <hi>Charles Bellmour</hi> whom I knew in the <hi>West-Indies?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Poh, that is not mentioned,—you know my Father took me against my Will from the University, and consigned me over, to the academic Discipline of a Man of War; so chat to prevent a Dejection of Spirits, I was oblig'd to run into the opposite Extreme,—as you yourself were wont to do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROVE.</speaker>
<p>Why, yes, I had my Moments of Reflection, and was glad to dissipate them—You know I always told you there was something extraordinary in my Story; and so there is still, I suppose it must be cleared up in a few Days now—I'm in no Hurry about it tho'; I must see the Town a little this Evening, and have my Frolic first. But to the Point <hi>Bellmour,</hi> you was going from the Tavern you say.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, about two in the Morning, and I perceiv'd an unusual Blaze in the Air,—I was in a rambling Humour, and so resolv'd to know what it was.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRISK.</speaker>
<p>I, and my Master went together Sir.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Oh! <hi>Rovewell!</hi> my better Stars ordain'd it to light me on to Happiness;—by sure Attraction led, I came to the very Street where a House was on Fire; Water-Engines playing, Flames ascending, all Hurry, Confusion, and Distress; when on a sudden the Voice of Despair, Silver sweet, came thrilling down to my very Heart;—poor,
<pb n="6" facs="13"/>
dear, little Soul, what can she do, cried the Neighbours? Again she scream'd, the Fire gathering Force, and gaining upon her every Instant;—here Ma'am said I, leap into my Arms, I'll be sure to receive you;—and wou'd you think it?—down she came,—my dear <hi>Rovewell,</hi> such a Girl!—I caught her in my Arms you Rogue, safe, without Harm.—The dear naked <hi>Venus,</hi> just risen from her Bed, my Boy,—her slender Waist <hi>Rovewell,</hi> the downy Smoothness of her whole Person, and her Limbs harmonious, swell'd by Nature's softest Hand.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROVE.</speaker>
<p>Raptures, and Paradise!—What Seraglio in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> did you carry her to?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL</speaker>
<p>There again now! Do, prithee correct your Way of Thinking, take a <hi>quantum sufficit</hi> of virtuous Love, and purify your Ideas.—Her lovely Bashfulness, her delicate Fears,—her Beauty heighten'd and endear'd by Distress, dispers'd my wildest Thoughts, and melted me into Tenderness and Respect.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROVE.</speaker>
<p>But <hi>Bellmour,</hi> surely she has not the Impudence to be modest after you have had Possession of her Person.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>My Views are honourable I assure you, Sir; but her Father is so absurdly positive.—The Man's distracted about the Balance of Power, and will give his Daughter to none but a Politician.—When there was an Execution in his House, he thought of nothing but the Camp at <hi>Pyrna,</hi> and now he's a Bankrupt, his Head runs upon Ways and Means, and Schemes for paying off the national Debt: The Affairs of Europe engross all his Attention, while the Distresses of his lovely Daughter pass unnoticed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROVE.</speaker>
<p>Ridiculous enough!—But why do you mind him? Why don't you go to Bed to the Wench at once?—Take her into Keeping Man.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>How can you talk so affrontingly of her?—Have not I
<pb n="7" facs="14"/>
told you tho' her Father is ruin'd, still she has great Expectancies from a rich Relation?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROVE.</speaker>
<p>Then what do you stand watering at the Mouth for? If she is to have Money enough to pay for her China, her Gaming Debts, her Dogs, and her Monkeys, marry her then, if you needs must be ensnar'd; be in a Fool's Paradise for a Honey-Moon, then come to yourself, wonder at what you've done, and mix with honest Fellows again;—carry her off I say, and never stand whining for the Father's Consent.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Carry her off!—I like the Scheme,—will you assist me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROVE.</speaker>
<p>No, no, there I beg to be excus'd. Don't you remember what the Satyrist says,—Never marry while there's a Halter to be had for Money, or a Bridge to afford a convenient Leap.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BELL.</speaker>
<p>Prithee leave Fooling.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<hi>malo Animo</hi>—it is held so in the Books—and what says the Statute? By the 5th <hi>George</hi> 2d, <hi>Cap.</hi> 30. Not surrendering or imbezzling is Felony without Benefit of Clergy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>Ay,—you tell me News—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>Give me leave, Sir,—I am instructed to expound the Law to you; Felony is thus described in the Books, <hi>Felonia,</hi> saith <hi>Hotoman, de verbis feudalibus significat capitale facinus,</hi> a capital Offence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>You tell me News, you do indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>It was so apprehended by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and the <hi>Longobards,</hi> and what saith Sir <hi>Edward Coke? Fieri debeat felleo animo.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>You've told me News—I did not know it was Felony; but if the <hi>Flanders</hi> Mail should come in while I am there—I shall know nothing at all of it—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>But why shou'd you be uneasy? <hi>cui bono,</hi> Mr. <hi>Quidnunc, cui bono?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>Not uneasy! If the Papists should beat the Protestants—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>But I tell you, they can get no Advantage of us. The Laws against the further Growth of Popery will secure us—there are Provisoes in Favour of Protestant Purchasers under Papists—10th <hi>Geo.</hi> I. Cap. 4 and 6 <hi>Geo.</hi> II. Cap. 5.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>Ay!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>And besides <hi>Popish</hi> Recusants can't carry Arms, so can have no Right of Conquest, <hi>Vi &amp; armis.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>That's true—that's true—I'm easier in my Mind—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>To be sure, what are you uneasy about? The Papists can have no Claim to <hi>Silesia</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20" facs="27"/>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>Can't they?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODICIL.</speaker>
<p>No, they can set up no Claim—If the Queen on her Marriage had put all her Lands into <hi>Hotchpot</hi> then indeed—and it seemeth saith <hi>Littleton,</hi> that this Word <hi>Hotchpot</hi> is in <hi>English</hi> a Pudding—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>You reason very clearly, Mr. <hi>Codicil,</hi> upon the Rights of the Powers at War, and so now if you will, I am ready to talk a little of my Affairs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>Nor does the Matter rest here; for how can she set up a Claim, when she has made a Conveyance to the House of <hi>Brandenburgh?</hi> the Law, Mr. <hi>Quidnunc</hi> is very severe against fraudulent Conveyances—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>S'bodikins, you have satisfied me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>Why therefore then—if he will levy Fines and suffer a common Recovery, he can bequeath it as he likes in <hi>feodum simplex,</hi> provided he takes care to put in <hi>ses Heres.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>I'm heartily glad of it,—so that with regard to my Effects—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>Why then suppose she was to bring it to a Tryal at Bar—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>I say with regard to the full Disclosure of my Effects—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>What wou'd she get by that?—it would go off upon a special Pleading.—and as to Equity—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>Pray now must I surrender my Books and my Pamphlets?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>What wou'd Equity do for her? Equity can't relieve her, he might keep her at least twenty Years before a Master to settle the Account—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="21" facs="28"/>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>You have made me easy about the Protestants in this War, you have indeed—so that with regard to my appearing before the Commissioners.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>And as to the <hi>Ban of the Empire,</hi> he may demur to that. For all Tenures by <hi>Knight's Service</hi> are abolished, and the Statute 12 <hi>Char.</hi> II. has declared all Lands to be held under a <hi>common Socage.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>Pray now, Mr. <hi>Codicil,</hi> must not my Creditors appear to prove their Debts?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CODIC.</speaker>
<p>Why therefore then, if they're held in <hi>Common Socage,</hi> I submit it to the Court,—whether the Empire can have any Claim to <hi>Knight's-Service;</hi>—they can't call to him for a single Man for the Wars.—<hi>Unum Hominem ad Guerram;</hi>—for what is <hi>Common Socage?—Socagium idem est quod Servitium socae,</hi>—the Service of the Plough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUID.</speaker>
<p>I am ready to attend 'em—But pray now, when my Certificate is signed,—it is of great Consequence to me to know this. I say, Sir, when my Certificate is signed, mayn't I then—Hey! <stage>(starting up)</stage> Hey!—What do I hear?</p>
