<hi>Cowper</hi>'s Thoughts
are intent, (as they
have been, many Years) on
<pb facs="5"/>
the Good of his Countrey;
I know Your Ladyship delights
in Reading; as often
as the Care of Your Family,
and the Ceremonies of Life,
allow You Leisure for an Amusement,
too Elegant to
become Fashionable. The Two
young Ladies, likewise, emulating
the Accomplishments of
their Mother, are sensible of
the Advantages, arising from
<pb facs="6"/>
the early Use of Books;
which give such a Bloom to
the Mind, as the Prime of
Beauty discloses in the Features.
Had I, therefore, been
able to make this Tragedy
(which, I humbly request,
may appear under Your Ladyship's
Protection) as Compleat,
as it is Innocent; It
might have proved a lasting
Testimony of my sincerest Acknowledgments
<pb facs="7"/>
for such Obligations,
as I can never forget,
nor disown.</p>
<p>I have had the Honour,
though I live concealed in
the utmost Privacy of Life,
long to enjoy Your Ladyship's
Favour. If You are
pleased to pardon this publick
Declaration of my Gratitude;
what has been the secret
Boast of my Heart, will,
<pb facs="8"/>
henceforward, turn to my
greatest Reputation.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. WILKS.</stage>
<l>VErtues, and Vices, are to Realms confin'd:</l>
<l>And, Climates give a Tincture to the Mind.</l>
<l>Still This, or That, Peculiar Inclination</l>
<l>Remains, Unalter'd;—and denotes a Nation.</l>
<l>Thus Rivers flow; thus Mountains, ever, stand;</l>
<l>The Marks, through every Age, of every Land.</l>
<l><hi>Britons,</hi> you'll see, when <hi>Vanoc</hi> comes before yee,</l>
<l>The Love of Freedom is your ancient Glory.</l>
<l>The <hi>Romans,</hi> first, this Native Vertue broke;</l>
<l>Made us Polite;—and bow'd us to the Yoke.</l>
<l>The <hi>Saxons,</hi> then, Unpolish'd,—greatly Rude,</l>
<l>Strangers to Luxury,—and Servitude,</l>
<l>Reviv'd the <hi>British</hi> Manliness of Soul,</l>
<l>That spurns at Tyranny, nor brookes Controul.</l>
<l>In Time, another Set of <hi>Romans</hi> came;</l>
<l>And brought worse Slavery:—Though they chang'd the
Name:</l>
<l>Tamed us with Luxuries of a different Kind;</l>
<l>And made plain Truth distasteful to the Mind.</l>
<l>By <hi>Nassaw</hi>'s Aid, at last, we drive Them, hence;</l>
<l>And, once again, return to <hi>common Sense.</hi></l>
<l><pb facs="10"/>
In <hi>Britain,</hi> ever may It keep Possession!</l>
<l>Establish'd, by the <hi>Protestant Succession.</hi></l>
<l>Blest in a Prince, whose high-traced Lineage springs</l>
<l>From the famed Race of our Old <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings;</l>
<l>Our Zeal for Liberty we, safely, own:—</l>
<l>He makes it the firm Basis of his Throne.</l>
<l>Remember, then, the Dangers, you have past:—</l>
<l>And, let your Earliest Virtue—be your Last.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by Mrs. YOUNGER.</stage>
<l>WHAT Tragick Bustle in this <hi>British</hi> Play!—</l>
<l>But,—I am told, 'tis writ the <hi>ancient Way.</hi></l>
<l>Nay;—That it is not <hi>Modern,</hi> is plain Fact:—</l>
<l>There's not one <hi>Simile,</hi>—to close an Act.</l>
<l>But, let me see:—What other Art is wanting?—</l>
<l>In Tragedy, there ought to be some <hi>Ranting:</hi></l>
<l>Something, so Exquisite;—so very Good;—</l>
<l>It cannot, possibly, be understood!</l>
<l>But, <hi>Gwendolen's</hi> hard Fate I censure, most.—</l>
<l>The blooming Princess,—Fair,—as any Toast;</l>
<l>Captive to <hi>Valens; Yvor</hi>'s promis'd Bride;</l>
<l>Between Two, bashful Knights,—a Virgin died.</l>
<l>Three Hours, unblest,—with an <hi>Italian,</hi> pass'd!</l>
<l>No warbling Lover could have been more chaste.—</l>
<l><pb facs="12"/>
Our keener Sportsmen would have seiz'd the Quarry:—</l>
<l>But, thus it is,—when Men design—to marry.</l>
<l>Still harder Fate!—If <hi>Druid-Songs</hi> be true,</l>
<l>She must,—for ever!—Her first Flame renew.</l>
<l>Such monst'rous Constancy let <hi>Heathen</hi> Schools</l>
<l>Injoin:—We, <hi>Christian</hi> Maids, are no such Fools.</l>
<l>One Month,—at most,—we can a Husband bear:—</l>
<l>There's not <hi>Two Honey-Moons,</hi> in any Year.</l>
<l>Then; what a Brute is <hi>Vanoc!</hi>—What a Pother!—</l>
<l>How could she help it, if—she lov'd another?</l>
<l>Poor <hi>Cartismand!</hi>—There's not a Man,—now living,</l>
<l>But would have seem'd, at least, far more forgiving.</l>
<l>What?—Not connive at One?—or Two?—or Three?—</l>
<l>Well!—<hi>Britain</hi> never, till of late, was Free!</l>
<l>How would his <hi>British</hi> Blood be set a madding,</l>
<l>Had he, in <hi>Masquerades</hi> beheld her, gadding!</l>
<l>But, why does <hi>Vellocad</hi> not, once, appear?</l>
<l>He was a pretty Fellow!—you may swear!</l>
<l><hi>And, what though</hi> Vanoc <hi>says,</hi> He could not fight?</l>
<l>Is that the Way to do a Lady, Right?</l>
<l><pb facs="13"/>
Since those rude Times, <hi>Husbands</hi> are more discreet;</l>
<l>And know their <hi>Cue,</hi> to wink at—<hi>what is meet.</hi></l>
<l>Then, take us as we are.—'Tis no great Matter:—</l>
<l>For Women will be frail, while Men can flatter.</l>

<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Such easy Purchase, here, you shall not find.</l>
<l>The brave <hi>Ostorius,</hi> our late General,</l>
<l>In War experienced; to Fatigues inur'd;</l>
<l>Impair'd by Wounds, and the slow waste of Years;</l>
<l>Despairing to subdue these hardy <hi>Britons,</hi></l>
<l>Died with his Laurels blasted on his Brow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Did.</speaker>
<l>No sooner was his Death to <hi>Rome</hi> convey'd,</l>
<l>Than I petition'd to command in <hi>Britain.</hi></l>
<l><hi>Claudius</hi> approv'd my Zeal; and bade me speed</l>
<l>To tame <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and assert his Empire.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>May <hi>Jove,</hi> the Guardian of the <hi>Capitol,</hi></l>
<l>He, the great <hi>Stayer</hi> of our Troops in Rout,</l>
<l>Fulfill your Hopes, and animate the Cohorts!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Did.</speaker>
<l>At <hi>Rome,</hi> indeed, the <hi>Britons</hi> are allow'd</l>
<l>To dare in War;—perhaps, even more than <hi>Romans:</hi></l>
<l>And <hi>Caradoc,</hi> their captive Chief, was prais'd,</l>
<l>As a rough Warriour, of undaunted Boldness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Oh, <hi>Didius,</hi> had you prov'd their martial Rage;</l>
<l>The desperate Fury of their wild Assault!—</l>
<l>Not <hi>Scythians,</hi> not fierce <hi>Dacians,</hi> onward rush</l>
<l>With half the Speed:—Nor, half so swift retreat.</l>
<l>In Chariots, fang'd with Scythes, they scour the Field;</l>
<l>Drive through our wedged Batalions with a Whirl;</l>
<l>And strew a dreadful Harvest on the Plain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Did.</speaker>
<l>But, Conduct overcomes the forward Foe:</l>
<l>And <hi>Fabius,</hi> under Disappointments patient,</l>
<l>Taught <hi>Romans,</hi> first, to conquer by Delay.</l>
<l>Now, to the Business, <hi>Valens:</hi>—Since, from you,</l>
<l>As foremost Tribune of the Soldiers here,</l>
<l>Do I, your General, expect my Knowledge.</l>
<l>Instruct me; whence this Uproar, through the Land:</l>
<l>And, wherefore <hi>Vanoc,</hi> the sworn Friend to <hi>Rome,</hi></l>
<l>(For, so our Emperour esteem'd this Prince)</l>
<l>Why he should spurn against our Rule; and stir</l>
<l>The Tributary Provinces to War.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>You must have heard of <hi>Cartismand.</hi>—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Did.</speaker>
<l>You mean,</l>
<l>The wealthy Queen;—our powerful Allie,</l>
<l>Who gave up <hi>Caradoc?</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="17"/>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>A Female Warriour:</l>
<l>Queen of the <hi>Brigantians.</hi>—Her did <hi>Vanoc,</hi></l>
<l>Prince of the <hi>Cornavians,</hi> wed—A Contract,</l>
<l>More in Ambition founded, than in Love.</l>
<l>While this Alliance held, we stood secure.</l>
<l>But, <hi>Cartismand,</hi> miss-led by fond Desire,</l>
<l>Provokes a Husband, jealous of his Honour.</l>
<l>Unable, longer, to conceal her Flame,</l>
<l>And fearing Vengeance, gathering to a Storm;</l>
<l>She crowns her Lover: Takes him to her Bed,</l>
<l>By solemn Nuptials: And, defying <hi>Vanoc,</hi></l>
<l>Attempts, by War, to vindicate her Choice.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Did.</speaker>
<l>But, how are We concern'd in this Debate?</l>
<l>This private Jar?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>I hasten to the Point.</l>
<l>One Battle—(Yes;—a Skirmish, more, there was)</l>
<l>With adverse Fortune fought, by <hi>Cartismand;</hi></l>
<l>Her Subjects, most, revolt:—Distress'd; pursued;</l>
<l>She begs Protection from the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms:</l>
<l>And vows perpetual Homage, for the Service.</l>
<l><hi>Ostorius</hi> interposed—No Terms of Peace</l>
<l>Would satisfy the Conquerour.—Then we,</l>
<l>To balance <hi>Vanoc</hi>'s Power, receive the Queen;</l>
<l>And aid her to sustain unequal War.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Did.</speaker>
<l>And can we not intreat this angry Prince?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Oh, that you might!—yet, old <hi>Ostorius</hi> fail'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Did.</speaker>
<l>By Promises, suspend his Rage, a while?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>What Offers would he not reject, from <hi>Romans!</hi></l>
<l>Did you but know him;—(I have known him long)</l>
<l>You would not wish to count this Man a Foe!—</l>
<l>In Friendship, and in Hatred, obstinate;</l>
<l>Provok'd with Ease; as hard to reconcile:</l>
<l>In Justice rigid; in Resentment warm;</l>
<l>Punctual, alike, to punish, or reward:</l>
<l>A wilful, hasty;—But, a gallant <hi>Briton!</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Did.</speaker>

<l><hi>Vanoc,</hi> whose Breach of Faith, and foul Rebellion,</l>

<l>Restore the Queen; retrieve your late Defeat;</l>

<l>Then, <hi>Valens,</hi> shall fair <hi>Gwendolen</hi> be thine;</l>
<l>Thy Captive Prize; the Servant of thy Will:</l>
<l>And satisfy the Longings of thy Soul!</l>

<l>Thou, <hi>Idwall,</hi> dost not know, how <hi>Valens</hi> loves:</l>
<l>Nor feel the Power of such excelling Beauty!—</l>
<l>I would not triumph over <hi>Gwendolen:</hi></l>
<l>Nor make her mine, against her free Consent.</l>
<l>There was a Time, before her injur'd Sire</l>

<l>And she, then Heiress to no large Dominion,</l>
<l>Might not disdain to wed a <hi>Roman</hi> Tribune.</l>

<l>You have punish'd.</l>

<speaker>Alan.</speaker>
<l>Alas! The Princess—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Yvor.</speaker>
<l>How!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alan.</speaker>
<l>She is a Captive:—</l>
<l>Born off:—A Prisoner, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Yvor.</speaker>
<l>A Prisoner; say you?—But it cannot be.—</l>
<l>A Captive?—Speak:—Whence, this Intelligence?</l>
<l>Some idle Rumour!—<hi>Ebranc</hi> was her Guard.</l>
<l>Do not dally with my Fondness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alan.</speaker>
<l><hi>Ebranc</hi> did all, that Man could do, to save
her.</l>
<l>A Band of <hi>Romans,</hi> Part (it is suppos'd)</l>
<l>Of the main Body sent, too late, to succour</l>
<l>The <hi>Caledonian</hi> Troops; as back they came,</l>
<l>Skirting within the Wood, espied the Princess,</l>
<l>Then returning; and bore away their Prize.</l>
<l>The trusty <hi>Ebranc</hi> fell, in her Defence.</l>
<l>A Soldier, scaping; has inform'd the King.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Yvor.</speaker>
<l>It is enough!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alan.</speaker>
<l>Why do you droop? Why, speechless? Why,
my Prince,</l>
<l>That sadden'd Brow; that settled Look of Woe?</l>
<l>You must not nourish, thus, a silent Sorrow.—</l>
<l>Never, have I beheld you thus, before!—</l>
<l>This is too much! Oh, speak!—and be reliev'd.—</l>
<l>That Groan exceeds your Silence!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Yvor.</speaker>
<l>I am wretched.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alan.</speaker>
<l>Why will you boad such Ills? Why, quit your
Hopes,</l>
<l>To nurse Despair? And, on the first Alarm,</l>
<l>Abandon Reason?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Yvor.</speaker>
<l>Thou hast quite unman'd me!—</l>
<l>But, <hi>Yvor</hi> has no farther Use for Reason:</l>
<l>I give it up; resign each Faculty:</l>
<l>The Power of Recollection is my Torment.</l>
<l>Alas, what Relish can I have for Life?</l>
<l>What Vertue, what Ambition, can awake</l>
<l>My Soul to Action?—I renounce, I curse,</l>
<l>My Victory; my Bane: Pernicious Conquest!</l>
<l><pb n="28" facs="42"/>
Now, let the <hi>Romans</hi> take what I possess:—</l>
<l>The Island let them take!—A little Cave</l>
<l>Suffices me, to grieve!—A while, to grieve;</l>
<l>And, then, to die forgotten!—Or if mention'd,</l>
<l>Known, only, for my most disasterous Love!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alan.</speaker>
<l>Your Words afflict me:—Talk not thus,
my Prince.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Yvor.</speaker>
<l>O I must talk!—Do not forbid, but hear,
me:—</l>
<l>And, I must talk of <hi>Gwendolen,</hi>—And <hi>Yvor!</hi></l>
<l>Names, never to be spoken of, asunder.</l>
<l>The Heart of Man can not conceive the Love,</l>
<l>I bore to <hi>Gwendolen!</hi>—I did not know,</l>
<l>Not half, the excessive Measure of my Fondness.</l>
<l>She was,—Alas, what was she not, to Me,</l>
<l>When she was mine!—In Her did I rejoyce;</l>
<l>For Her I liv'd; for Her, alone, I fought.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alan.</speaker>
<l>Fight for her, still; and win her from the
<hi>Romans.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Yvor.</speaker>
<l>To Death will I pursue the Ravishers:</l>
<l>Inflict worse Vengeance, than the Scourge of War;</l>
<l>And torture Them,—as they now torture Me!</l>
<l>Though <hi>Vanoc</hi> should relent, I never can:</l>
<l>His Injuries are light, compar'd to mine!</l>
<l>My People, sure, will never tamely bear</l>
<l>To see their Prince, a Wretch!—Though I should fall,</l>
<l>They will avenge me.—Thou, <hi>Alan,</hi> wilt avenge
me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alan.</speaker>
<l>Now, are you Man, again!—I did forbear</l>
<l>To stop your Flow of Grief:—But, will assist</l>
<l>Your Rage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Yvor.</speaker>
<l>I feel my Resolution rise.</l>
<l>My Strength returns: It springs!—Through every
Nerve,</l>
<l>My Spirits swell!—Single, methinks, I drive</l>
<l>The Foe!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alan.</speaker>
<l>They shall not, long, detain the Princess.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Yvor.</speaker>
<l>Say that again, my Friend! Accomplish that;</l>
<l><pb n="29" facs="43"/>
And I am blest!—Give me back <hi>Gwendolen,</hi></l>
<l>And, in the meanest Cottage, I am happy.—</l>
<l>Her Soul is rais'd above the Pride of Life!</l>
<l>But, thou would'st fain beguile my Care: and fain</l>
<l>Would I deceive my self.—Too flattering
Hope!—</l>
<l>I never shall behold the Princess more.</l>
<l><hi>Didius</hi> will know the Value of his Prize.</l>
<l>He will, himself, be smitten with such Beauty:</l>
<l>Or if, to <hi>Rome,</hi> he send the lovely Captive;</l>
<l>What costlier Present can he make to <hi>Claudius?</hi></l>
<l>His wide-spread Empire, the whole World, contains</l>
<l>Nothing, so rare!—She is surpassing Fair!—</l>
<l>The Eye, that does behold; the Ear, that hears her,</l>
<l>The Eye, the Ear, the Soul throughout, is ravish'd!</l>
<l>No, <hi>Alan;</hi> I shall never see her more.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alan.</speaker>
<l>These are the Fears of Love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Yvor.</speaker>
<l>They are such Fears,</l>
<l>As give my Heart no Respite from Despair.</l>
<l>I am not wont to be alarm'd.—What, then,</l>
<l>Must <hi>Gwendolen</hi> have suffer'd, from her Fears,</l>
<l>When I was absent, in the midst of Dangers!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Alan.</speaker>
<l>In either Sex, true Love is truly anxious.</l>

<l>In all my Heart, I do not find one Hope▪</l>

<l>And I rejoice, that <hi>Didius</hi> chose out me,</l>
<l>To greet a Prince, in my Esteem, the foremost.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>So much for Words.—Now, to your Purpose,
Tribune.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Sent by our new Lieutenant, who in <hi>Rome,</hi></l>
<l>And since from me, has heard of your Renown;</l>
<l>I come to offer Peace: To reconcile</l>
<l>Past Enmities; to strike perpetual Leagues</l>
<l>With <hi>Vanoc:</hi> Whom our Emperor invites</l>
<l><pb n="34" facs="48"/>
To Terms of Friendship; strictest Bonds of Union.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>We must not hold a Friendship with the <hi>Romans.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Why must you not?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>Vertue forbids it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Once,</l>
<l>You thought, our Friendship was your greatest Glory.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>I thought you honest.—I have been deceiv'd.—</l>
<l>Would you deceive me twice? No, Tribune; no!</l>
<l>You sought for War:—Maintain it as you may.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, Prince; your Vehemence of Spirit,</l>
<l>Prone ever to Extremes, betrays your Judgment.</l>
<l>Would you once cooly reason on our Conduct,—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>Oh, I have scann'd it thorough!—Night
and Day</l>
<l>I think it over: And I think it base;</l>
<l>Most infamous!—Let who will judge;—but
<hi>Romans!</hi></l>
<l>Did not my Wife, did not my menial Servant,</l>
<l>Seducing each the other, both conspire</l>
<l>Against my Crown, against my Fame, against my
Life?</l>
<l>Did they not levy War, and wage Rebellion?</l>
<l>And when I would assert my Right and Power,</l>
<l>As King and Husband; when I would chastise</l>
<l>Two most abandon'd Wretches: Who, but <hi>Romans,</hi></l>
<l>Oppos'd my Justice, and maintain'd their Crimes?</l>
<l>Do I not reason cooly on your Conduct?—</l>
<l>You have the Art, to gloss the foulest Cause:</l>
<l>I shew it undisguis'd.—For <hi>Cartismand,</hi></l>
<l>The <hi>Romans</hi> stood: The <hi>Britons,</hi> and the Gods,</l>
<l>Declar'd for <hi>Vanoc.</hi>—Do I argue fairly?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>At first, the <hi>Romans</hi> did not interpose;</l>
<l>But griev'd to see their best Allies at Variance.</l>
<l>Indeed, when you turn'd Justice into Rigor,</l>
<l>And even that Rigor was pursued with Fury;</l>
<l><pb n="35" facs="49"/>
We undertook to mediate for the Queen;</l>
<l>And hoped to moderate—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>To moderate!—</l>
<l>What would you moderate? My Indignation?</l>
<l>The just Resentment of a vertuous Mind?</l>
<l>To mediate for the Queen!—You undertook!—</l>
<l>Wherein concern'd it You? But as you love</l>
<l>To exercise your Insolence!—Are you</l>
<l>To arbitrate my Wrongs?—Must I ask leave;</l>
<l>Must I be taught, to govern o'er my Houshold?</l>
<l>Am I, then, void of Reason, and of Justice?</l>
<l>When, in my Family, Offences rise;</l>
<l>Shall Strangers, saucy Intermeddlers, say,</l>
<l>Thus far, and thus, are you allow'd to punish?</l>
<l>When I submit to such Indignities;</l>
<l>When I am tamed to that Degree of Slavery:—</l>
<l>Make me a Citizen, a Senator of <hi>Rome;</hi></l>
<l>To watch, to live upon the Smiles of <hi>Claudius:</hi></l>
<l>To give my Wife, my Children, to his Pleasures;</l>
<l>And sell my Countrey with my Voice for Bread.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Prince, you insult, upon this Day's Success.</l>
<l>You may provoke too far.—But I am cool.—</l>
<l>I give your Anger scope.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>Who shall confine it?—</l>
<l>The <hi>Romans!</hi>—Let them rule their Slaves.—
I blush,</l>
<l>That dazzled in my Youth with Ostentation,</l>
<l>The Trappings of the Men seduced my Vertue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Blush rather, that you are a Slave to Passion;</l>
<l>Subservient to the Wildness of your Will;</l>
<l>Which, like a Whirlwind, tears up all your Vertues;</l>
<l>And gives you not the Leisure to consider.</l>
<l>Did not the <hi>Romans</hi> civilize you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>No!—</l>
<l>They brought new Customs, and new Vices over;</l>
<l>Taught us more Arts, than honest Men require;</l>
<l>And gave us Wants, that Nature never gave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>We found you naked:—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="36" facs="50"/>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>And you found us free!—</l>
<l>Now, on my Soul, the Mountain Stag, that springs</l>
<l>From Height to Height, and bounds along the Plains,</l>
<l>Nor has a Master to restrain his Course;</l>
<l>That Mountain Stag would <hi>Vanoc</hi> rather be,</l>
<l>Than be a Slave!—Much less, the Slave of Slaves!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Would you be temperate once, and hear me
out!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>Speak Things▪ that honest Men may hear with
Temper!</l>
<l>Speak the plain Truth; and varnish not your Crimes!</l>
<l>Say, that you once were vertuous:—Long ago!</l>
<l>A frugal, hardy People;—like the <hi>Britons:</hi></l>
<l>Before you grew thus elegant in Vice,</l>
<l>And gave your Luxuries the Name of Vertues.</l>
<l>The Civilizers!—The Disturbers, say;—</l>
<l>The Robbers, the Corrupters of Mankind!</l>
<l>Proud Vagabonds! who make the World your Home;</l>
<l>And lord it, where you have no Right.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>You wrong</l>
<l>Your Friends, your Benefactors, your Instructors!</l>
<l>Since you will have the Truth, I speak it out.</l>
<l>Who, but the <hi>Romans,</hi> fashion'd your rude Natures?</l>
<l>Smooth'd your rough Tempers? Changed you into
Men,</l>
<l>From wild <hi>Barbarians,</hi> Savages in Woods?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>You changed us into Beasts, most servile Beasts!</l>
<l>To bear your Impositions; your Dominion:</l>
<l>Taught us, indeed, to cloath, to dwell in Houses,</l>
<l>To feast, to sleep on Down, to be profuse:</l>
<l>A fine Exchange for Liberty!—What Vertue</l>

<l>Humanity.</l>
</sp>

<l>Can you disown a Truth, confess'd by All?</l>
<l>A Praise, a Glory, known in barbarous Climes?</l>
<l>Far as our Legions march, they carry Knowledge;</l>
<l>The Arts, the Laws, the Discipline of Life.</l>
<l><pb n="37" facs="51"/>
Our Conquests are Indulgencies; and We,</l>
<l>Not Masters, but Protectours of Mankind.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>Prevaricating, false,—most courteous Tyrants;—</l>
<l><hi>Romans!</hi>—Rare Patterns of Humanity!</l>
<l>Came you, then, here, thus far, through Waves, to
conquer,</l>
<l>To waste, to plunder; out of mere Compassion?</l>
<l>Is it Humanity that prompts you on</l>
<l>To ravage the whole Earth: To burn, destroy?</l>
<l>To raise the Cries of Widows, and of Orphans?</l>
<l>To lead in Bonds, the generous, free-born Princes,</l>
<l>Who spurn, who fight against your Tyranny?</l>
<l>Happy for us,—and happy for you, Spoilers,</l>
<l>Had your Humanity ne'er reach'd our World!—</l>
<l>It is a Vertue,—(so it seems you call it)</l>
<l>A <hi>Roman</hi> Vertue! that has cost you dear:—</l>
<l>And dearer shall it cost, if <hi>Vanoc</hi> lives.—</l>
<l>Or if we die, we shall leave those behind us,</l>
<l>Who know the Worth of <hi>British</hi> Liberty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>I mean not to reproach your Ancestors;</l>
<l>Untaught, uncultivated, as they were:</l>
<l>Inhospitable, full of Ferocity;</l>
<l>Lions in Spirit; cruel beyond Men:</l>
<l>Your Altars reeking oft with human Blood.</l>
<l>Nor will I urge you farther on our Merits.</l>
<l>I come instructed, Sir, to offer Peace:</l>
<l>The Peace, that <hi>Didius</hi> offers, <hi>Valens</hi> sues for.</l>
<l>Propose your Terms; and you will find me forward</l>

<l>Is, then, the Dignity,</l>
<l>The Faith of <hi>Claudius,</hi> founded on Injustice?</l>
<l><pb n="38" facs="52"/>
Is it his Glory to protect a Traiteress;</l>
<l>A base, a profligate adulterous Woman?</l>
<l>Fit Emperour, indeed, to govern <hi>Romans!</hi>—</l>
<l>But, <hi>Valens,</hi> let me tell you, the free <hi>Britons</hi></l>
<l>Would not endure his Sway.—They must have Justice;</l>
<l>And from their Prince, do they require it most!—</l>
<l>Nay, they demand it.—</l>
<l>Were I a Villager, the meanest Freeman</l>
<l>In all your State; and <hi>Claudius</hi> should presume,—</l>
<l>Or any <hi>Caesar,</hi>—to abuse his Power,</l>
<l>And authorize enormous Crimes; I would not,—</l>
<l>No!—were his Anger Death,—I could not bear
it!</l>
<l>But would oppose him, to my stretch of Power.</l>
</sp>

<l>And barter with you for the Boast of <hi>Britain?</hi></l>

<l>In the full Senate, now, he stands undaunted;</l>
<l>An aged, awful, a triumphant Captive!</l>
<l>His Looks, his Words, appall the robed Assembly;</l>
<l>And shake vain-glorious <hi>Claudius</hi> on his Throne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l><hi>Claudius</hi> took off his Chains.—Remember
that!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>Then did your Nobles see a Man; a <hi>Briton!</hi></l>
<l>The Admiration; the Terrour of the <hi>Romans.</hi></l>
<l>This is the mighty Debt you owe that Woman.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Yet, after this, you married <hi>Cartismand!</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Van.</speaker>
<l>I was ambitious.—That I learn'd from You.</l>
<l>That I did wed with Treachery, and was a Friend</l>
<l>To <hi>Romans,</hi> is the whole Reproach of <hi>Vanoc.</hi></l>
<l>But they and she, combin'd, have clear'd my Honour!</l>
<l>And, when I stain it, by forgiving Either;</l>
<l>Let my own Subjects brand me for a Coward.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<l>Talk not of Honour, Prince!—An empty
Sound;</l>
<l>The Vaunting of a <hi>Briton</hi> in his Choler!—</l>
<l>To me, at least, you should have spar'd the Boast.</l>
<l>You can renounce your Word, we know, at Pleasure;</l>
<l>Forget past Services, worn Marks of Kindness:</l>
<l>Then quarrel with your Friends, to free the Debt;</l>
<l>And sacrifice all Faith to your Resentments.</l>

<l>This Accusation I can hear unmov'd:</l>
<l>It sullies not my Soul, nor taints my Fame.</l>
<l>It is a Slander; I expect no better.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val</speaker>
<l>Do I calumniate then?—Ungrateful <hi>Vanoc!</hi>—</l>

<l>Was, by her Father, first assur'd to <hi>Valens?</hi></l>

<l>Bid us to live.—We must not throw off Life;—</l>
<l>But lay it down; when Heaven appoints us Rest.</l>
<l>Just Gods!—If my Resentments be too strong;</l>
<l>Or, over-rigid to compensate Wrong:—</l>
<l>Severely you my rash Offence chastise;—</l>
<l>Bereft, in <hi>Gwendolen,</hi> of All, I prize!</l>
