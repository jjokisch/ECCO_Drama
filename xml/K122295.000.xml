<opener><salute>MADAM,</salute></opener>
<p>I KNOW not whether mankind can be said to have less Vanity—but of this I am certain, that they have infinitely more Delicacy—formerly, Dedicators met with few difficulties in addressing their Patrons—They made them every thing that was wise and good, and their Patrons, in return, (though they might not approve the production) yet gave their authors an entire credit for a clear insight into human nature.
<pb n="ii" facs="3"/>
But contraband traffick brings many a good trade into disrepute, and a fair dealer has now often only a limited opportunity of vending his just merchandise. How hard then is the condition of us modern Dedicators! To lavish encomiums where they are not due, is not the fashion of the times; and now, (when the Subject demands, and there is the fairest opportunity of expatiating on the most exemplary Character) I have your LADYSHIP's express prohibition—But public disorders frequently bring the seeds of remedy along with them—If I had spoken as I ought, it had been called an UNIVERSAL opinion, (and your LADYSHIP perceives, by this address, that I affect singularity;) but should I in the least have failed, the world would have loudly exclaimed, that

I had said TOO LITTLE, and your LADYSHIP still more unjustly have censured me, for having said TOO MUCH.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by Dr. GOLDSMITH.
Spoken by Mr. QUICK.</byline>
<l>IN these bold times, when Learning's sons explore</l>
<l>The distant climate and the savage shore;</l>
<l>When wise <hi>Astronomers</hi> to <hi>India</hi> steer,</l>
<l>And quit for <hi>Venus,</hi> many a brighter here;</l>
<l>While <hi>Botanists,</hi> all cold to smiles and dimpling,</l>
<l>Forsake the fair, and patiently—go simpling;</l>
<l>When every bosom swells with wond'rous scenes,</l>
<l>Priests, cannibals, and hoity-toity queens:</l>
<l>Our bard into the general spirit enters,</l>
<l>And fits his little frigate for adventures:</l>
<l>With <hi>Scythian stores,</hi> and trinkets deeply laden,</l>
<l>He this way steers his course, in hopes of trading—</l>
<l>Yet ere he lands he'as ordered me before,</l>
<l>To make an observation on the shore.</l>
<l>Where are we driven? Our reck'ning sure is lost!</l>
<l>This seems a barren and a dangerous coast.</l>
<l>Lord what a sultry climate am I under!</l>
<l>Yon ill-foreboding cloud seems big with thunder. <stage>(Upper Gallery.)</stage></l>
<l><pb facs="6"/>
There Mangroves spread, and larger than I've seen 'em— <stage>(Pit.)</stage></l>
<l>Here trees of stately size—and turtles in 'em— <stage>(Balconies.)</stage></l>
<l>Here ill-condition'd oranges abound— <stage>(Stage.)</stage></l>
<l>And apples <stage>(takes up one and tastes it)</stage> <hi>bitter</hi> apples strew the ground.</l>
<l>The place is uninhabited I fear;</l>
<l>I heard a hissing—there are serpents here!</l>
<l>O there the natives are—a dreadful race!</l>
<l>The men have tails, the women paint the face!</l>
<l>No doubt they're all barbarians—Yes, 'tis so,</l>
<l>I'll try to make palaver with them though; <stage>(making signs)</stage></l>
<l>'Tis best however keeping at a distance.</l>
<l>Good Savages, our Captain craves assistance;</l>
<l>Our ship's well stor'd;—in yonder creek we've laid her,</l>
<l>His honour is no mercenary trader;</l>
<l>This is his first adventure, lend him aid,</l>
<l>Or you may chance to spoil a thriving trade.</l>
<l>His goods he hopes are prime, and brought from far,</l>
<l>Equally fit for gallantry and war.</l>
<l>What no reply to promises so ample?</l>
<l>I'd best step back—and order up a sample.</l>

<l><seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HENCE this daring insult?</l>
<l>What strangers these, who, with intrusive march,</l>
<l>Have pass'd the summits of high Imaus' rocks?</l>

<l>Or spoil the plains of innocence and peace?</l>

<pb n="2" facs="9"/>
<speaker>INDATER.</speaker>
<l>Our troops, whose minds no dangers can appal,</l>
<l>Observing from afar some hasty steps,</l>
<l>Advance with eager speed.—The Persians meet us;</l>
<l>When straight a martial youth, with haughty mien,</l>
<l>Demanded of us parley with our master.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>What master know we here, where all are free?</l>
<l>No kings, no subjects; but all friends and brothers.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>INDATER.</speaker>
<l>He said, that visiting the Persian frontier,</l>
<l>He wish'd to see a people far renown'd</l>
<l>For ancient manners and bleak liberty:</l>
<l>We offer them safe conduct and protection;</l>
<l>Whilst they present to our astonish'd sight</l>
<l>Rich trappings, blazing shields, gold, diamonds, pearls,</l>
<l>The guilty spoils of desolating war:</l>
<l>But we reject these specious toys of grandeur;</l>
<l>For poverty is chiefest grandeur here,</l>
<l>Not wealth, corrupter of simplicity,</l>
<l>In short, we swear an amity sincere,</l>
<l>And lo! they come to crown this prosp'rous day,</l>
<l>Which gives me happiness and Zobeide.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="10"/>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>But Zobeide, thou know'st, whose blooming charms</l>
<l>Have won thy soul—was born among the Persians!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>INDATER.</speaker>
<l>The sun, which rises o'er yon eastern hill,</l>
<l>And which each morn we gratefully adore,</l>
<l>Shines not on us alone—It shines on Persia:</l>
<l>Then may not Persia boast its ray divine?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>Thou little know'st the secrets of my heart;</l>
<l>Since, after four long years in friendship past,</l>
<l>I still am stranger to her father's story—</l>
<l>What fate mysterious lur'd him to these climes;</l>
<l>Why persecution still attends his exile;</l>
<l>For, ever as I'd sooth him into converse,</l>
<l>He answers but with tributary tears.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>INDATER.</speaker>
<l>To this fair country's maxims and her laws</l>
<l>He cheerfully submits—and way-worn age</l>
<l>Can rarely change the bent of early nature.</l>
<l>But fairest Zobeide—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>Is worthy of thee.</l>
<l>And yet I cannot guess the cause, her father</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="11"/>
Blushes to speak of whom he is descended;</l>
<l>His rank, his fortunes, and his fame unknown.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>INDATER.</speaker>
<l>Whoe'er he be, I'm sure he's just and valiant:</l>
<l>He loves me—He is father to my Zobeide.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>As no vile aims debase a Scythian's mind,</l>
<l>We will not meanly stoop to ask a prize,</l>
<l>The brightest, fairest prize, whilst covert fears</l>
<l>Or foul distrust sit low'ring on our motives.</l>
<l>Seek him, my son—if no unworthy thoughts</l>
<l>Shall harbour in his breast—I will consent.</l>
<l>But see he comes—</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter SEYFEL.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>INDATER.</speaker>
<l>O generous old man!</l>
<l>Thou dear companion of our happy shepherds!</l>
<l>This day some gallant youths will soon arrive,</l>
<l>And view with joy the festive rites that wait us;</l>
<l>I from thy hand this happy day receive</l>
<l>A gift more precious than the throne of Cyrus:</l>
<l>What age of service can repay such goodness!</l>
<l>I cannot speak the feelings of my heart.</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="12"/>
Witness, ye Gods!—not Hermodon more shares</l>
<l>My duty or my love:—Ah! whence those tears?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEYFEL.</speaker>
<l>They flow from tenderness and former cares:</l>
<l>If, amidst all my griefs, this faithful union</l>
<l>Should heal some wound which rankles near my heart,</l>
<l>The scar would still remain—For blessings oft</l>
<l>Recal to mind the evils we have suffer'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>INDATER.</speaker>
<l>O! speak the fatal source of each misfortune;</l>
<l>If not redress, we may at least infuse</l>
<l>The sacred balm of sympathizing pity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>For all the friendship we have firmly sworn,</l>
<l>Thou ow'st this tribute to us.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEYFEL.</speaker>
<l>My gentle youth,</l>
<l>Zobeide, thou know'st, submits her will to mine;</l>
<l>She is the only good the Gods have left me:</l>
<l>I wish this marriage—I'll advise, persuade,</l>
<l>But cannot strain the bond of rightful sway,</l>
<l>The soft authority of friend and parent.</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="13"/>Go, thou dear hope of my declining age,</l>
<l>I would some private conf'rence here—Meanwhile,</l>
<l>Artless as native truth, still urge thy suit,</l>
<l>Obtain her promise, and depend on mine.</l>
<stage>[Exit Indater.</stage>
<l>Ere I begin the story of my life,</l>
<l>Let me gaze round with grateful rapture here:</l>
<l>Believe me, Hermodon—these rocks, these trees,</l>
<l>To me seem nobler than the Persian court.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>Thou once wast great?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEYFEL.</speaker>
<l>I was.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>Too long, my friend,</l>
<l>Thy griefs pent up, have prey'd upon thy heart:</l>
<l>I do not hate the great—I love the Persians;</l>
<l>Their laws and noble manners I admire;</l>
<l>Tho' all mankind at first were equal born,</l>
<l>I strictly hold that subjects should obey</l>
<l>Those whom their Gods make delegates of pow'r:</l>
<l>Simplicity's soft charms, in this republic,</l>
<l>Are no fit lessons for monarchic states.</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="14"/>
Could'st thou suppose that I was less attach'd</l>
<l>Because in Scythia—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEYFEL.</speaker>
<l>If I have long conceal'd</l>
<l>The source of my misfortunes—pardon me,</l>
<l>Pardon a parent's doubts—I'd lost my all:</l>
<l>My child here wander'd friendless—unprotected—</l>
<l>I fear'd the foul disgraces of her father</l>
<l>Would fall on her, and stain her rising glory.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>Forbear thy tears.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEYFEL.</speaker>
<l>Know then, that under Cyrus</l>
<l>I carried terror to th' affrighted nations.</l>
<l>Hircania bow'd her neck unto my yoke,</l>
<l>Hircania free till then.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>Most harsh the chains</l>
<l>Which gall the stubborn neck of liberty!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEYFEL.</speaker>
<l>Oppression's arts, unworthy of the brave</l>
<l>To be the Prince's slave, t' enslave his people,</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="15"/>
To crouch, or cruelly exact obedience,</l>
<l>Dazzled a while—but now demand repentance.</l>
<l>The noble Cyrus, with a lavish hand,</l>
<l>Would heap on me full measure of rewards;</l>
<l>I ever was the partner of his counsels—</l>
<l>But Cyrus died—and I was soon forgotten.</l>
<l>Cambyses I abandon'd—impious man!</l>
<l>Unworthy successor of such a father!</l>
<l>Ecbatan, as yet the abode of Media's Prince,</l>
<l>At her new court conceal'd my hoary head,</l>
<l>Till Smerdis, governing the Median realm,</l>
<l>Smerdis, who sought the ruin of the virtuous,</l>
<l>Gave a decisive blow to all my hopes;</l>
<l>The unbridled Athamand, his sister's son,</l>
<l>In firm alliance with a noble princess,</l>
<l>Whom Persia's court had destin'd to his love,</l>
<l>(His tyrant passions brooking no controul,)</l>
<l>Demanded Zobeide as despotic master.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>And did his life repay the glaring outrage?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEYFEL.</speaker>
<l>Thrice arm'd with innocence, th' undaunted fair</l>
<l>Compell'd our flight into this distant land;</l>
<l>By me alone she was deliver'd from him;</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="16"/>
The monsters, who surround the impious Smerdis,</l>
<l>More than their common arts employ'd against us;</l>
<l>With fairest colours hid the worst designs,</l>
<l>And couch'd the dagger, lab'ring to destroy us.</l>
<l>In Media it is treason, as at Babylon,</l>
<l>To brand the prince who next must fill the throne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>O dire effects of hell-born servitude!</l>
<l>Is then complaint a crime in Persia's court?</l>
<l>Can you regret the loss of basest grandeur?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEYFEL.</speaker>
<l>There you awake the thought which wrings my heart.</l>
<l>Smerdis proscrib'd my life—they seiz'd—they shar'd</l>
<l>Employments—wealth—the price of all my service.</l>
<l>My faithful child accompanied my flight;</l>
<l>With patient steps we labour'd up the steep</l>
<l>Of Taurus' craggy cliffs, whose o'erhung brow</l>
<l>Indignant frowns upon the boist'rous main.</l>
<l>Wearied by toils—thanks to the pitying Gods!</l>
<l>In these fair climes we found unhop'd-for peace:</l>
<l>Would I had here been born! All <hi>my</hi> regret</l>
<l>Is to have run a desperate mad career</l>
<l>In courts and camps, attendant upon kings.</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="17"/>But I perceive my child shut up in desarts,</l>
<l>Regrets the pleasures of her former life;</l>
<l>And much I fear that reason, filial duty,</l>
<l>Combat too weakly each delusive vision:</l>
<l>Courts and their pomp will fascinate our eyes</l>
<l>Ere bitter ills annoy the sick'ning soul.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMODON.</speaker>
<l>What ills await you here? ah! what regret?</l>
<l>With us she's free, applauded—honour'd—</l>
<l>No lurking dangers taint this hallow'd soil;</l>
<l>Here liberty has fixt her blest abode,</l>
<l>And looks with pity down upon the great.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEYFEL.</speaker>
<l>Oh! I should die content, if my dear child</l>
<l>Hated, like me, the perfidy of courts:</l>
<l>But let not my inquietudes repress</l>
<l>The dawning joys that beam upon thy fon.</l>
<l>Conceal them from him.</l>

<l>When Scythians fall, no stars withdraw their blaze,</l>
<l>An atom sinks unheeded—unregarded—</l>
<l>But O! thy fate drinks dry a nation's eyes,</l>
<l>All Persia sinks one great stupendous ruin,</l>
<l>And I become the murderer of a world.</l>

<l>This kind embrace o'erpays whole years of anguish;</l>

<speaker>ZOBEIDE.</speaker>
<l>Long has the captive worn the galling chain,</l>
<l>But now to hail the dawn of rising joys,</l>
<l>To view some holier land where mercy reigns,</l>
<l>Where peace shall bloom with blessings ever new;</l>
<l>Hail, happy land!—there, there again to rest,</l>
<l>Where man can not oppress, or I offend him;</l>
<l>Spare but his life, and thus to finish mine.</l>

<l>O live, my prince! thus dying I entreat thee.</l>

<l>What now is all the baseless dream of power,</l>
<l>Ambition's fire, the lust of wealth or empire?</l>
<l>The scene once clos'd, each glittering prospect fails—</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>By Mr. MURPHY. Spoken by Mrs. YATES.</byline>
<lg>
<l>WELL fare the man, peace to his gentle shade,</l>
<l>The Bard who first made Epilogues a trade;</l>
<l>Else what a life an Actress must pursue?—</l>
<l>To weep and rave is all she'd have to do;</l>
<l>Upon the Stage, with warring passions sore,</l>
<l>"To fret her hour, and then be heard no more."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now, after poison, daggers, rage, and death,</l>
<l>We come again to take a little breath;</l>
<l>Rally the Pit; set Belles and Beaux at odds,</l>
<l>And be a mere free-thinker to the Gods; <stage>[To the upper gallery.</stage></l>
<l>Chat in familiar strain; the Boxes maul;</l>
<l>—An Epilogue, like gaming—levels all.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Not e'en poor <hi>Bayes</hi> within must hope to be</l>
<l>Free from the lash:—His Play he writ for me,</l>
<l>'Tis true—and now my gratitude you'll see.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="91"/>
<l>Why ramble with <hi>Voltaire</hi> to Eastern climes,</l>
<l>To Scythian laws, and antiquated times?</l>
<l>Change but the names, his Tragedy, at best,</l>
<l>Slides into Comedy, and turns to jest.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>As thus—A Statesman, old, and out of place,</l>
<l>Sour, discontented, malice in his face,</l>
<l>(In these blest days, we but suppose the case)</l>
<l>Flies from <hi>St. James's</hi> to his own estate,</l>
<l>To chew the wisdom of each past debate;</l>
<l>How in the House he made a glorious stir,</l>
<l>With, "Sir, I move"—and, "Mr. Speaker, Sir!"</l>
<l><hi>Zobeide</hi>'s his daughter <hi>Sophy:—</hi>Oh! farewell</l>
<l>For her each haunt that charms a modern Belle!</l>
<l>Adieu <hi>Almack's! Cornelly's</hi> Masquerade!</l>
<l>Sweet <hi>Ranelagh! Vauxhall's</hi> enchanting shade!</l>
<l>Squire Groom makes love; Rich? yes; a vast domain;</l>
<l>Well-bred?—the savage Scythian of the Plain!</l>
<l>The match is fix'd; deeds sign'd; the knot is ty'd;</l>
<l>Down comes my Lord in all his glitt'ring pride.</l>
<l>And will my Angel chuse this rustic plan?</l>
<l>"Oh! Cuckold him by all means; I'm your man."</l>
<l>Now mark our Author's ignorance of life?</l>
<l>What, not elope? Is that a modish Wife?</l>
<l><pb facs="92"/>
Poor fool! she doubts; says No: the Husband dies:</l>
<l>Now stab yourself, says <hi>Bayes;</hi> but Nature cries,</l>
<l>How! sacrifice myself for vain Renown!</l>
<l><hi>John,</hi> put the horses to, and drive to town.</l>
<l>That would be life; the manners; painted high!</l>
<l>But our Bard makes,—to moisten ev'ry eye,</l>
<l>A Widow with a Prince refuse to fly.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet, after all, excuse him, Ladies, pray;</l>
<l>For sure there is some Nature in his Play.</l>
<l>A first attempt let no keen Censure blight,</l>
<l>Hereafter he may soar a nobler flight;</l>
<l>Drop one kind tear; give him that slender token;</l>
<l>And hither come, till the <hi>Pantheon</hi> open.</l>
