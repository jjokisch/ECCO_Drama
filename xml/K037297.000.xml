<byline>Written by the AUTHOR,</byline>
<stage>and spoken by Mr. HULL.</stage>
<sp>
<l>OUR modern Poets scarce know how to chuse</l>
<l>A subject worthy of the Tragic Muse;</l>
<l>For Bards so well have glean'd th' Historic field,</l>
<l>That scarce one sheaf th' exhausted ancients yield;</l>
<l>And these, our timid author leaves to men,</l>
<l>For classic themes demand a classic pen:</l>
<l>Yet still the wilds of fiction open lie,</l>
<l>A flow'ry prospect, and a boundless sky:</l>
<l>But hard the task the sober path to chuse,</l>
<l>And wand'ring Fancy's treacherous baits refuse.</l>
<l>—She dares not touch the Drama's <hi>nobler</hi> strings,</l>
<l>The fate of nations, and the fall of Kings;</l>
<l>The humbler scenes of private life she shews,</l>
<l>A simple story of domestic woes.</l>
<l>The weight of crowns, a kingdom's weal or woe,</l>
<l>How few can judge, because how few can know!</l>
<l>But here you all may boast the Critic's art,</l>
<l>Here, all are judges—who possess a heart.</l>
<l>To govern <hi>Empires</hi> is the lot of few,</l>
<l>But all who live have <hi>passions</hi> to subdue;</l>
<l>And, ev'n by Patriots let it be confess'd,</l>
<l><hi>These</hi> Rebel Subjects ought to be suppress'd,</l>
<l>These Ravagers which spoil the human breast.</l>
<l>Oh! deign to learn this obvious lesson here!</l>
<l>The verse is feeble, but the moral clear.</l>
<l>Your candour once endur'd our Author's lays,</l>
<l>Endure them now—that will be ample praise.</l>

<lg>
<l>UNHAND me, gentlemen, by Heaven, I say,</l>
<l>I'll make a ghost of him who bars my way.</l>
<l><stage>Behind the scenes.</stage></l>
<l>Forth let me come—A Poetaster true,</l>
<l>As lean as Envy, and as baneful too;</l>
<l>On the dull audience let me vent my rage,</l>
<l>Or drive these <hi>female</hi> scribblers from the stage:</l>
<l>For scene or history, we've none but these,</l>
<l>The law of Liberty and Wit they seize</l>
<l>In Tragic—Comic—Pastoral—they dare to please.</l>
<l>Each puny Bard must surely burst with spite,</l>
<l>To find that women with such fame can write:</l>
<l>But, oh, your partial favour is the cause,</l>
<l>Who feed their follies with such full applause;</l>
<l>Yet still our tribe shall seek to blast their fame,</l>
<l>And ridicule each fair pretender's aim;</l>
<l>Where the dull duties of domestic life,</l>
<l>Wage with the Muse's toils eternal strife.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>What motley cares <hi>Corilla's</hi> mind perplex,</l>
<l>While maids and metaphors conspire to vex!</l>
<l>In studious deshabille behold her sit,</l>
<l>A letter'd gossip, and a housewife wit;</l>
<l>At once invoking, though for different views,</l>
<l>Her gods, her cook, her millener, and muse,</l>
<l>Round her strew'd room, a frippery chaos lies,</l>
<l>A chequer'd wreck of <hi>notable</hi> and <hi>wise;</hi></l>
<l>Bills, Books, Caps, Couplets, Combs, a vary'd mass,</l>
<l>Oppress the toilet, and obscure the glass;</l>
<l>Unfinish'd here an Epigram is laid,</l>
<l>And there, a mantua-maker's Bill unpaid;</l>
<l>Here new-born Plays fore taste the town's applause,</l>
<l>There, dormant Patterns pine for future gauze;</l>
<l><pb n="vii" facs="6"/>
A moral Essay now is all her care,</l>
<l>A Satire next, and then a Bill of Fare:</l>
<l>A Scene she now projects, and now a Dish,</l>
<l>Here's Act the First—and here—remove with Fish.</l>
<l>Now while this Eye in a fine phrenzy rolls,</l>
<l>That, soberly casts up a Bill for Coals;</l>
<l>Black Pins and Daggers in one leaf she sticks,</l>
<l>And Tears and Thread, and Balls and Thimbles mix.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l><hi>Sappho,</hi> 'tis true, long vers'd in epic song,</l>
<l>For years esteem'd all household studies wrong;</l>
<l>When dire mishep, though neither shame nor sin,</l>
<l><hi>Sappho</hi> herself, and not her Muse, lies in.</l>
<l>The virgin Nine in terror fly the bower,</l>
<l>And matron Juno claims despotic power;</l>
<l>Soon Gothic hags the classic pile o'erturn,</l>
<l>A caudle-cup supplants the sacred urn;</l>
<l>Nor books, nor implements escape their rage,</l>
<l>They spike the ink-stand, and they rend the page;</l>
<l>Poems and Plays one barbarous fate partake,</l>
<l>Ovid and Plautus suffer at the stake,</l>
<l>And Aristotle's only sav'd—to wrap plumb cake.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet, shall a <hi>woman</hi> tempt the Tragic Scene?</l>
<l>And dare—but hold—I must repress my spleen;</l>
<l>I see your hearts are pledg'd to her applause,</l>
<l>White Shakespear's spirit seems to aid her cause;</l>
<l>Well pleas'd to aid—since o'er his sacred bier</l>
<l>A semale hand did ample trophies rear,</l>
<l>And gave the greenest laurel that is worshipp'd there.</l>

<sp>
<l>WHAT fools are serious melancholy villains</l>
<l>I play a surer game, and screen my heart</l>
<l>With easy looks, and undesigning smiles;</l>
<l>And while my actions spring from sober thought,</l>
<l>They still appear th' effect of wild caprice,</l>
<l>And I, the thoughtless slave of giddy chance.</l>
<l>What but this frankness has engag'd the promise</l>
<l>Of young Orlando, to confide to me,</l>
<l>That secret grief which preys upon his heart?</l>
<l>'Tis dangerous, indiscreet hypocrisy</l>
<l>To seem too good: I am the careless Bertrand,</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="9"/>
The honest, undesigning, plain, blunt man:</l>
<l>The follies I avow cloke those I hide,</l>
<l>For who will search where nothing seems conceal'd?</l>
<l>'Tis rogues of solid, prudent, grave demeanor</l>
<l>Excite suspicion; men on whose dark brow</l>
<l>Discretion, with his iron hand has grav'd</l>
<l>The deep-mark'd characters of thoughtfulness.</l>
<lg>
<l>Here comes my uncle, venerable Guildford,</l>
<l>Whom I cou'd honour, were he not the father</l>
<l>Of that aspiring boy, who fills the gap</l>
<l>'Twixt me and fortune;—Rivers, how I hate thee!</l>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> GUILDFORD.</stage>
<l>How fares my noble uncle?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUILDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Honest Bertrand!</l>
<l>I must complain we have so seldom met;</l>
<l>Where do you keep? believe me we have miss'd you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>O, my good Lord, your pardon—spare me, Sir,</l>
<l>For there are follies in a young man's life,</l>
<l>And idle thoughtless hours which I should blush</l>
<l>To lay before your wife and temperate age.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUILDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Well, be it so—youth has a privilege,</l>
<l>And I should be asham'd could I forget</l>
<l>I have myself been young, and harshly chide</l>
<l>The not ungraceful levity of youth.</l>
<l>Prudence becomes moroseness, when it makes</l>
<l>A rigid inquisition of the fault,</l>
<l>Not of the man, perhaps, but of his youth:</l>
<l>Foibles that shame the head on which old Time</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="10"/>
Has shower'd his snow, are then most pardonable,</l>
<l>And age has many a weakness of its own.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>Your gentleness, my Lord, and mild reproof,</l>
<l>Correct the wandrings of misguided youth,</l>
<l>More than rebuke, and shame it into virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUILDFORD.</speaker>
<p>Saw you my beauteous ward, the Lady Julia?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>She past this way, and with her your fair daughter,</l>
<l>Your Emmelina.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUILDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Call them both my daughters,</l>
<l>For scarce is Emmelina dearer to me,</l>
<l>Than Julia, the lov'd child of my adoption;</l>
<l>The hour approaches too, (and bless it, heaven,</l>
<l>With thy benignest, kindliest influence!)</l>
<l>When Julia shall indeed become my daughter,</l>
<l>Shall, in obedience to her father's will,</l>
<l>Crown the impatient vows of my brave son,</l>
<l>And richly pay him for his dangers past.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>Oft have I wonder'd how the gallant Rivers,</l>
<l>Youthful and ardent, doating to excess,</l>
<l>Cou'd dare the dangers of uncertain war,</l>
<l>E'er marriage had confirm'd his claim to Julia.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUILDFORD.</speaker>
<l>'Twas the condition of her father's will,</l>
<l>My brave old fellow-soldier, and my friend;</l>
<l>He wish'd to see our ancient houses join'd</l>
<l>By this, our children's union; but the veteran</l>
<l>So highly valued military prowess,</l>
<l>That he bequeath'd his fortunes and his daughter</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="11"/>
To my young Rivers, on these terms alone,</l>
<l>That he shou'd early seek renown in arms;</l>
<l>And if he from the field return'd a conqueror,</l>
<l>That sun which saw him come victorious home</l>
<l>Shou'd witness their espousals. Yet he comes not!</l>
<l>The event of war is to the brave uncertain,</l>
<l>Nor can desert in arms ensure success.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<p>Yet fame speaks loudly of his early valour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUILDFORD.</speaker>
<l>E'er since th' Italian Count, the young Orlando,</l>
<l>My Rivers' bosom friend has been my guest,</l>
<l>The glory of my son is all his theme:</l>
<l>Oh! he recounts his virtues with such joy,</l>
<l>Dwells on his merit with a zeal so warm,</l>
<l>As to his gen'rous heart pays back again</l>
<l>The praises he bestows.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>Orlando's noble,</l>
<l>He's of a tender, brave, and gallant nature,</l>
<l>Of honour most romantic, with such graces,</l>
<l>As charm all womankind.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUILDFORD.</speaker>
<l>And here comes one,</l>
<l>To whom the story of Orlando's praise</l>
<l>Sounds like sweet music.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>What, yourcharming daughter?</l>
<l>Yes, I suspect she loves th' Italian Count <stage>Aside.</stage></l>
<l>That must not be. Now to observe her closely.</l>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="5" facs="12"/>
<hi>Enter</hi> EMMELINA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>GUILDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Come hither, Emmelina: we were speaking</l>
<l>Of the young Count Orlando. What think you</l>
<l>Of this accomplish'd stranger?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EMMELINA. </speaker>
<stage>(Confused.)</stage>
<l>Sir, your pardon—</l>
<l>But as my father's guest, my brother's friend,</l>
<l>I do esteem the Count.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUILDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Nay, he has merit</l>
<l>Might justify thy friendship if he wanted</l>
<l>The claims thou mention'st; yet I mean to blame him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<l>What has he done that cou'd offend my father?</l>
<l>For you are just and are not angry lightly,</l>
<l>And he is mild, unapt to give offence,</l>
<l>As you to be offended.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUILDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Nay 'tis not much:</l>
<l>Why does Orlando shun of late my presence?</l>
<l>Why lose that chearful and becoming spirit</l>
<l>Which lately charm'd us all? Rivers will chide us,</l>
<l>Shou'd he return, and find his friend unhappy.</l>
<l>He is not what he was. What says my child?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<l>My Lord, when first my brother's friend arriv'd—</l>
<l>Be still, my heart. <stage>Aside.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>She dares not use his name,</l>
<l>Her brother's friend! <stage>Aside.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="13"/>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<l>When first your noble guest</l>
<l>Came from that voyage, he kindly undertook</l>
<l>To ease our terrors for my Rivers' safety,</l>
<l>When we believ'd him dead, he seem'd most happy,</l>
<l>And shar'd the universal joy he gave.</l>
<l>Of late he is less gay; my brother's absence</l>
<l>(Or I mistake) disturbs his friend's repose;</l>
<l>Nor is it strange, one mind informs them both,</l>
<l>Each is the very soul that warms the other,</l>
<l>And both are wretched, or are bless'd together.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<p>Why trembles my fair cousin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<l>Can I think</l>
<l>That my lov'd brother's life has been in danger,</l>
<l>Nor feel a strong emotion!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND. </speaker>
<stage>(Ironically.)</stage>
<l>Generous pity!</l>
<l>But when that danger has so long been past,</l>
<l>You shou'd forget your terrors.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<l>I shall never;</l>
<l>For when I think that danger sprung from friendship,</l>
<l>That Rivers, to preserve another's life,</l>
<l>Incurr'd this peril, still my wonder rises.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>And why another's life? Why not Orlando's?</l>
<l>Such caution more betrays than honest freedom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GUILDFORD.</speaker>
<l>He's still the same, the gibing thoughtless Bertrand,</l>
<l>Severe of speech, but ignorant of malice.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Guildford: Emmelina <hi>going.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="14"/>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>Stay, my fair cousin; still with adverse eyes</l>
<l>You view me. Say had I Orlando's form,</l>
<l>I mean, were I like him your brother's friend,</l>
<l>Then wou'd your looks be turn'd thus coldly on me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<l>But that I know your levity means nothing,</l>
<l>And that your heart accords not with your tongue,</l>
<l>This wou'd offend me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>Come, confess the truth,</l>
<l>That this gay Florentine, this Tuscan rover,</l>
<l>Has won your easy heart, and given you his:</l>
<l>I know the whole, I'm of his secret council,</l>
<l>He has confess'd—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<p>Ha! what has he confess'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>That you are wondrous fair: nay, nothing farther;</l>
<l>How disappointment fires her angry cheek!</l>
<l>Yourself have told the rest, your looks avow it,</l>
<l>Your eyes are honest, nor conceal the secret.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<l>Conceal! Virtue has nothing to conceal;</l>
<l>So far from dreading, it solicits notice,</l>
<l>And wishes every secret thought it harbours,</l>
<l>Bare to the eye of men, as 'tis to heav'n.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>Yet mark me well, trust not Orlando's truth;</l>
<l>The citron groves have heard his amorous vows</l>
<l>Breath'd out to many a beauteous maid of Florence;</l>
<l>Bred in those soster climes, his roving heart</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="15"/>
Ne'er learn'd to think fidelity a virtue,</l>
<l>But laughs at tales of British constancy.</l>
<l>But see Orlando comes—perhaps to seek you,</l>
<l>With eyes bent downwards, and with folded arms,</l>
<l>Disorder'd looks, and negligent attire,</l>
<l>And all the careless equipage of love,</l>
<l>He bends this way. Why does the mounting blood</l>
<l>Thus crimson your fair cheek? He does not see us;</l>
<l>I'll venture to disturb his meditations,</l>
<l>And instantly return.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Bertrand.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<l>No more, but leave me.</l>
<l>He's talkative but harmless, rude but honest,</l>
<l>Fuller of mirth than mischief. See they meet—</l>
<l>This way they come; why am I thus alarm'd?</l>
<l>Oh for a little portion of that art,</l>
<l>Ungenerous men ascribe to our whole sex!</l>
<l>A little artifice were prudence now:</l>
<l>But I have none; my poor unpractis'd heart,</l>
<l>Is so unknowing of dissimulation,</l>
<l>So little skill'd to seem the thing it is not,</l>
<l>That if my lips are still, my looks betray me.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ORLANDO <hi>and</hi> BERTRAND.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<p>Now to alarm her heart, and search out his.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Aside.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLANDO.</speaker>
<l>We crave your pardon, beauteous Emmelina,</l>
<l>If rudely we intrude upon your thoughts;</l>
<l>Thoughts pure as infants' dreams, or angels' wishes,</l>
<l>And gentle as the breast from whence they spring.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="16"/>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<l>Be still, my heart, nor let him see thy weakness.</l>
<stage>Aside.</stage>
<l>We are much bound to thank you, cousin Bertrand,</l>
<l>That since your late return, the Count Orlando</l>
<l>Appears once more among us.—Say, my Lord,</l>
<l>Why have you shunn'd your friends' society?</l>
<l>Was it well done? My father bade me chide you;</l>
<l>I am not made for chiding, but he bade me;</l>
<l>He says, no more you rise at early dawn</l>
<l>With him to chase the boar; I pleaded for you,</l>
<l>Told him 'twas savage sport.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLANDO.</speaker>
<p>What was his answer?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<l>He said 'twas sport for heroes, and made heroes;</l>
<l>That hunting was the very school of war,</l>
<l>Taught our brave youth to shine in nobler fields,</l>
<l>Preserv'd 'em from the rust of dull inaction,</l>
<l>Train'd 'em for arms, and fitted them for conquest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>In truth, my Lord, you're a right happy man;</l>
<l>Her parting look proclaims that you are blest;</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="17"/>
The crimson blushes on her cheek display'd</l>
<l>A gentle strife 'twixt modesty and love:</l>
<l>Discretion strove to dash the rising joy,</l>
<l>But conquering love prevail'd and told the tale.</l>
<l>My Lord, you answer not.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>ORLANDO.</speaker>
<l>What shall I say?</l>
<l>Oh, could'st thou read my heart!</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>The hour is come</l>
<l>When my impatient friendship claims that trust</l>
<l>Which I so oft have press'd, and you have promis'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLANDO.</speaker>
<l>I cannot tell thee; 'tis a tale of guilt;</l>
<l>How shall I speak? my resolution sickens;</l>
<l>All virtuous men will shun me, thou wiltscorn me,</l>
<l>And fly the foul contagion of my crime.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>My bosom is not steel'd with that harsh prudence</l>
<l>Which wou'd reproach thy failings; tell me all;</l>
<l>The proudest heart loves to repose its faults</l>
<l>Upon a breast that has itself a tincture</l>
<l>Of human weakness; I have frailties too,</l>
<l>Frailties that teach me how to pity thine.</l>
<l>What, silent still? Thou lov'st my beauteous cousin!</l>
<l>Have I not guess'd?</l>
</sp>

<speaker>ORLANDO.</speaker>
<l>I own that she has charms</l>
<l>Might warm a frozen stoic into love,</l>
<l>Tempt hermits back again to that bad world</l>
<l>They had renounc'd, and make religious men</l>
<l>Forgetful of their holy vows to heaven;</l>
<l>Yet Bertrand—come, I'll tell thee all my weakness:</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="18"/>
Thou hast a tender sympathising heart,</l>
<l>And art not rigid to a friend's defects.</l>
<l>That heav'nly form I view with eyes as cold</l>
<l>As marble images of lifeless saints;</l>
<l>I see, and know the workmanship divine,</l>
<l>My judgment owns her exquisite perfections,</l>
<l>But my rebellious heart denies her claim.</l>
</sp>

<p>What do I hear! you love her not!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLANDO.</speaker>
<l>Oh, Bertrand!</l>
<l>For pity do not hate me; but thou must,</l>
<l>For am I not at variance with myself?</l>
<l>Yet shall I wrong her gentle trusting nature,</l>
<l>And spurn the heart I labour'd to obtain?</l>
<l>She loves me, Bertrand, Oh! too fure she loves me,</l>
<l>Loves me with tenderest, truest, chastest passion;</l>
<l>Loves me, oh my curs'd fate! as I love— Julia.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>Heard I aright? Did you not speak of Julia?</l>
<l>Julia, the lovely ward of my good uncle?</l>
<l>Julia! the mistress of your friend, of Rivers?</l>

<l>Display my crime in all its native horrors;</l>
<l>Tell me some legend of infernal falschood,</l>
<l>Tell me some dreadful tale of perjur'd friendship,</l>
<l>Of trust betray'd, and innocence deceiv'd;</l>
<l>Place the black chronicle before my eyes,</l>
<l>With added guilt and aggravated horror,</l>
<l>That I may see the evils which await me,</l>

<l>Thou know'st I left my native Italy,</l>
<l>Directed hither by the noble Rivers,</l>
<l>To ease his father's fears, who thought he fell</l>
<l>In that engagement where we both were wounded;</l>
<l>His was a glorious wound, gained in the cause</l>
<l>Of gen'rous friendship, for an hostile spear</l>
<l>Aim'd at my breast, Rivers in his receiv'd,</l>
<l>Sav'd my devoted life, and won my soul.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<p>So far I knew, but what of Emmelina?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLANDO.</speaker>
<l>Whether her gentle beauties first allur'd me,</l>
<l>Or whether peaceful scenes, and rural shades,</l>
<l>Or leisure, or the want of other objects,</l>
<l>Or solitude, apt to engender love,</l>
<l>Engag'd my soul, I know not, but I lov'd her.</l>
<l>We were together always, till the habit</l>
<l>Grew into something like necessity:</l>
<l>When Emmelina left me I was sad,</l>
<l>Nor knew a joy till Emmelina came,</l>
<l>Her soft society amus'd my mind,</l>
<l>Fill'd up my vacant heart, and touch'd my soul.</l>
<l>'Twas gratitude, 'twas friendship, 'twas esteem,</l>
<l>'Twas reason, 'twas persuasion, nay 'twas love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<p>But where was Julia?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLANDO.</speaker>
<l>Oh! too soon she came,</l>
<l>For when I saw that wond'rous form of beauty,</l>
<l>I stood entranc'd, like some astronomer,</l>
<l>Who, as he views the bright expanse of heaven,</l>
<l>Finds a new star. I gaz'd, and was undone;</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="20"/>
Gaz'd, and forgot the tender Emmelina,</l>
<l>Gaz'd, and forgot the gen'rous, trusting Rivers,</l>
<l>Forgot my faith, my friendship and my honour.</l>

<p>Does Julia know your love?</p>

<l>What! think'st thou I am so far gone in guilt</l>
<l>As boldly to avow it? Bertrand, no,</l>
<l>For all the kingdoms of the spacious earth,</l>
<l>I wou'd not wrong my friend, or damn my honour.</l>

<l>Think I have lodg'd a secret in thy breast,</l>
<l>On which my peace, my fame, my all depends;</l>
<l>Long have I struggled with the fatal truth,</l>
<l>And scarce have dar'd to breathe it to myself;</l>
<l>For oh! too surely the first downward step,</l>
<l>The treacherous path that leads to guilty deeds,</l>

<l>I grant that honour's something, manly honour,</l>

<l>Yes, spite of maiden shame, and burning blushes,</l>
<l>Let me confess he was most welcome to me!</l>
<l>At first my foolish heart so much deceiv'd me,</l>
<l>I thought I lov'd him for my brother's sake;</l>
<l>But when I closely search'd this bosom traytor,</l>

<speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
<l>Blush not to own it, 'twas a well plac'd flame!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>EMMELINA.</speaker>
<l>He talk'd of you, I listen'd with delight,</l>
<l>And thought it was the subject only charm'd me;</l>
<l>But when Orlando chose another theme,</l>
<l>Forgive me, Rivers, but I listen'd still</l>
<l>With undiminish'd joy—he talk'd of love,</l>
<l>Nor was that theme less grateful than the former.</l>
<l>I seem'd the very idol of his soul;</l>
<l>Rivers, he said, would thank me for the friendship</l>
<l>I bore to his Orlando; I believ'd him.</l>
<l>Julia was absent then—but what of Julia?</l>

<l>If I did name her, 'twas to note the time,</l>

Which never had a birth? is she not mine?</l>

<l>He loves thee, Emmelina:</l>

<l>He fears to lose thee, fears his father's will</l>
<l>May dash his rising hopes, nor give thee to him.</l>

<l>Oh, flatterer! thus to sooth my easy nature</l>

<l>WHY do my feet unbidden seek this grove?</l>

<l>I might retort the charge, my lord Orlando,</l>

<l>Beyond a brother's dearness, sav'd his life,</l>
<l>And cherish'd it when sav'd beyond his own,</l>

<l>After long tedious months of expectation,</l>
<l>Alive, victorious, and as firm in friendship</l>
<l>As fondness cou'd have wish'd, or fancy feign'd;</l>
<l>I might enquire why thus Orlando shuns him,</l>
<l>Why thus he courts this melancholy gloom,</l>

<l>Enough! enough!</l>

<l>Ha! defer it?</l>
<l>Impossible; what wou'd my Rivers think?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLANDO.</speaker>
<l>No matter what; 'tis for his sake I ask it;</l>
<l>His peace, his happiness, perhaps his life</l>

<l>His life! his life!</l>
<l>Some dreadful thought seems lab'ring in your breast;</l>
<l>Explain this horrid mystery.</l>

<l>I dare not.</l>

<l>These—happy nuptials; but if you refuse</l>

Tremble for him you love, the altar's self</l>

<l>What rage? what madman? what remorseless villain?</l>

<l>What have you done?</l>

<l>Stay,</l>

<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>That threat unlocks my tongue, I must not lose thee.</l>
<l>Sweet Julia wept, clasp'd her fair hands, and cried</l>
<l>Why was I left a legacy to Rivers,</l>
<l>Robb'd of the power of choice? seeing me she started,</l>
<l>Wou'd have recal'd her words, blush'd, and retir'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Shall I defraud my friend? he bled to gain her?</l>

<l>HOW many ways there are of being wretched!</l>
<l>The avenues to happiness how few!</l>
<l>When will this busy, fluttering heart be still?</l>
<l>When will it cease to feel, and beat no more?</l>
<l>Ev'n now it shudders with a dire presage</l>
<l>Of something terrible it fears to know.</l>
<l>Ent'ring, I saw my venerable father,</l>
<l>In earnest conference with the Count Orlando;</l>
<l>Shame and confusion fill'd Orlando's eye,</l>
<l>While stern resentment fir'd my father's cheek.</l>
<l>And look, he comes, with terror on his brow!</l>
<l>He sees me, he beholds his child, and now</l>

<l>Thou art all innocence,</l>
<l>Just what a parent's fondest wish wou'd frame;</l>
<l>No fault of thine e'er stain'd thy father's cheek,</l>

<l>Thy moral comes too late; thou shoud'st have urg'd</l>
<l>Thy caution sooner, or not urg'd at all;</l>
<l>Thou shoud'st—alas! I know not what I say—</l>
<l>But this I know, the charming Julia loves me,</l>

<l>Be circumspect; the hour is just at hand;</l>

<p>Why so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BERTRAND.</speaker>
<l>Why so?</l>
<l>Make Julia the companion of your flight;</l>
<l>'Tis what she means, you must not mind her struggles;</l>
<l>A little gentle violence perhaps,</l>
<l>To make her yield to what she had resolv'd,</l>
<l>And save her pride, she'll thank you for it after.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORLANDO.</speaker>
<l>Take her by force? I like not that; O Bertrand,</l>
<l>There is a mutinous spirit in my blood,</l>
<l>That wars against my conscience.—Tell my Julia,</l>
<l>I will not fail to meet her.</l>

<speaker>ORLANDO.</speaker>
<l>This giant sin whose bulk so lately scar'd me,</l>
<l>Shrinks to a common size; I now embrace</l>
<l>What I but lately fear'd to look upon.</l>
<l>Why what a progress have I made in guilt!</l>
<l>Where is the hideous form it lately wore?</l>
<l>It grows familiar to me; I can think,</l>
<l>Contrive, and calmly mediate on mischief,</l>
<l>Talk temp'rately of sin, and cherish crimes</l>
<l>I lately so abhorr'd, that had they once</l>
<l>But glanc'd upon the surface of my fancy</l>

<l>Ye dear, ye well known scenes of former bliss!</l>
<l>Scenes which I hop'd were fated to bestow</l>
<l>Still dearer blessings in a beauteous bride!</l>
<l>Thou gay pavilion which art dress'd so fair</l>
<l>To witness my espousals, why, ah! why</l>
<l>Art thou adorn'd in vain? Yet still I court thee,</l>
<l>For Julia lov'd thee once:—dear faithless Julia!</l>
<l>Yet is she false? Orlando swore she was not:</l>
<l>It may be so; yet she avoids my presence,</l>
<l>Keeps close from every eye, but most from mine.</l>

<l>Thus far propitious fortune fills my sails;</l>

<l>There shall Orlando's well-arm'd servants meet him,</l>

<l>If they shou'd fail, his honest cousin Bertrand</l>
