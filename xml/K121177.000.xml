<head>To the Right Honourable <hi>CHARLES MONTAGƲE,</hi> One of the Lords of the <hi>TREASURY.</hi></head>
<opener><salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I Heartily wish this Play were as perfect as I intended it, that it might be more worthy your Acceptance; and that my Dedication of it to you, might be more becoming that Honour and Esteem which I, with every Body, who are so fortunate as to know you, have for you. It had your Countenance when yet unknown; and now it is made publick, it wants your Protection.</p>
<p>I would not have any Body imagine, that I think this Play without its Faults, for I am Conscious of several. I confess I design'd (whatever Vanity or Ambition occasion'd that Design) to have written a true and regular Comedy, but I found it an Undertaking which put me in mind of—<hi>Sudet multum, frustraque laboret ausus idem.</hi> And now to make Amends for the Vanity of such a Design, I do confess both the Attempt, and the imperfect Performance. Yet I must take the Boldness to say, I have not miscarried in the whole; for the Mechanical part of it is perfect. That I may say with as little Vanity, as a Builder may say he has built a House according to the Model laid down before him; or a Gardiner that he has set his Flowers in a Knot of such or such a Figure. I design'd the Moral first, and to that Moral I invented the Fable, and do not know that I have borrow'd one Hint of it any where. I made the Plot as strong as I could, because it was single, and I made it single, because I would avoid Confusion, and was resolved to preserve the three Unities of the Drama, which I have visibly done to the utmost Severity. This is what I ought not to observe upon my self; but the Ignorance and Malice of the greater Part of the Audience is such, that they would make a Man turn Herald to his own Play, and Blazon every Character. However, Sir, this Discourse is very impertinent to you, whose
<pb facs="3"/>
Judgement much better can discern the Faults, than I can excuse them; and whose good Nature, like that of a Lover, will find out those hidden Beauties (if there are any such) which it wou'd be great Immodesty for me to discover. I think I don't speak improperly when I call you a <hi>Lover</hi> of Poetry; for it is very well known she has been a very kind Mistress to you; she has not deny'd you the last Favour; you have enjoy'd her, and she has been fruitful in a most Beautiful Issue—If I break off abruptly here, I hope every Body will understand that it is to avoid a Commendation, which, as it is your Due, would be most easie for me to pay, and too troublesome for you to receive.</p>
<p>I have, since the Acting of this Play, harken'd after the Objections which have been made to it; for I was Conscious where a true Critick might have put me upon my Defence. I was prepared for their Attack; and am pretty confident I could have vindicated some Parts, and excused others; and where there were any plain Miscarriages, I would most ingenuously have confess'd 'em. But I have not heard any thing said sufficient to provoke an Answer. That which looks most like an Objection, does not relate in particular to this Play, but to all or most that ever have been written; and that is Soliloquy. Therefore I will answer it, not only for my own sake, but to save others the Trouble, to whom it may hereafter be Objected.</p>
<p>I grant, that for a Man to Talk to himself, appears absurd and unnatural; and indeed it is so in most Cases; but the Circumstances which may attend the Occasion, make great Alteration. It oftentimes happens to a Man, to have Designs which require him to himself, and in their Nature cannot admit of a Confident. Such, for certain, is all Villany; and other less mischievous Intentions may be very improper to be Communicated to a second Person. In such a Case therefore the Audience must observe, whether the Person upon the Stage takes any notice of them at all, or no. For if he supposes any one to be by, when he talks to himself, it is monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree. Nay, not only in this case, but in any Part of a Play, if there is expressed any knowledge of an Audience, it is insufferable. But otherwise, when a Man in Soliloquy reasons with himself, and <hi>Pro</hi>'s and <hi>Con</hi>'s, and weighs all his Designs: We ought not to imagine that this Man either talks to us, or to himself; he is only thinking, and thinking such Matter as were inexcusable Folly in him to speak. But because we are conceal'd Spectators of the Plot in agitation, and the Poet finds it necessary to let us know the whole Mystery of his
<pb facs="4"/>
Contrivance, he is willing to inform us of this Person's Thoughts; and to that end is forc'd to make use of the expedient of Speech, no other better way being yet invented for the Communication of Thought.</p>
<p>Another very wrong Objection has been made by some who have not taken Leisure to distinguish the Characters. The Hero of the Play, as they are pleas'd to call him, (meaning <hi>Mellefont</hi>) is a Gull, and made a Fool, and cheated. Is every Man a Gull and a Fool that is deceiv'd? At that rate I'm afraid the two Classes of Men, will be reduc'd to one, and the Knaves themselves be at a loss to justifie their Title: But if an Open-hearted honest Man, who has an entire Confidence in one whom he takes to be his Friend, and whom he has oblig'd to be so; and who (to confirm him in his Opinion) in all Appearance, and upon several Trials has been so: If this Man be deceiv'd by the Treachery of the other; must he of necessity commence Fool immediately, only because the other has prov'd a Villam? Ay, but there was Caution given to <hi>Mellefont</hi> in the First Act by his Friend <hi>Careless.</hi> Of what Nature was that Caution? Only to give the Audience some Light into the Character of <hi>Maskwell,</hi> before his Appearance; and not to convince <hi>Mellefont</hi> of his Treachery; for that was more than <hi>Careless</hi> was then able to do: He never knew <hi>Maskwell</hi> guilty of any Villany; he was only a sort of Man which he did not like. As for his suspecting his Familiarity with my Lady <hi>Touchwood:</hi> Let 'em examine the Answer that <hi>Mellefont</hi> makes him, and compare it with the Conduct of <hi>Maskwell</hi>'s Character through the Play.</p>
<p>I would beg'em again to look into the Character of <hi>Maskwell</hi> before they accuse <hi>Mellefont</hi> of Weakness for being deceiv'd by him. For upon summing up the Enquiry into this Objection, it may be found they have mistaken Cunning in one Character, for Folly in another.</p>
<p>But there is one thing, at which I am more concerned than all the false Criticisms that are made upon me; and that is, some of the Ladies are offended. I am heartily sorry for it, for I declare I would rather disoblige all the Criticks in the World than one of the Fair Sex. They are concerned that I have represented some Women Vicious and Affected: How can I help it? It is the Business of a Comick Poet to paint the Vices and Follies of Human-kind; and there are but two Sexes, Male, and Female, <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> which have a Title to Humanity: And if I leave one half of them out, the Work will be imperfect. I should be very glad of an opportunity to make my Compliment to those Ladies who are offended: But they can no more expect it in a Comedy, than to be
<pb facs="5"/>
Tickled by a Surgeon, when he's letting 'em Blood. They who are Virtuous or Discreet, can hardly be offended, for such Characters as these distinguish <hi>them,</hi> and make their Beauties more shining and observ'd: And they who are of the other kind, may nevertheless pass for such, by seeming not to be displeas'd, or touch'd with the Satire of this <hi>Comedy.</hi> Thus have they also wrongfully accus'd me of doing them a Prejudice, when I have in reality done them a Service.</p>
<p>I have heard there are some who intend to accuse this Play of Smuttiness and Bawdy: But I can hardly believe it, because I took a particular Care to avoid it, and if they find any in it, it is of their own making, for I did not design it to be so understood. But to avoid my saying any Thing upon a Subject, which has been so admirably handled before, and for their better Instruction, I earnestly recommend to their Perusal, the Epistle Dedicatory before the <hi>Plain-Dealer.</hi></p>
<p>You will pardon me, Sir, for the Freedom I take of making Answers to other People, in an Epistle which ought wholly to be sacred to you: But since I intend the Play to be so too, I hope I may take the more Liberty of Justifying it, where it is in the Right.</p>
<p>I must now, Sir, declare to the World, how kind you have been to my Endeavours; for in regard of what was well meant, you have excus'd what was ill perform'd. I beg you would continue the same Method in your Acceptance of this Dedication. I know no other way of making a Return to that Humanity you shew'd, in protecting an Infant, but by Enrolling it in your Service, now that it is of Age and come into the World. Therefore be pleas'd to accept of this as an Acknowledgement of the Favour you have shewn me, and an Earnest of the real Service and Gratitude of,</p>

<head>To my Dear Friend Mr, <hi>CONGREVE,</hi> On His COMEDY, call'd, The Double-Dealer.</head>
<lg>
<l>WELL then; the promis'd Hour is come at last;</l>
<l>The present Age of Wit obscures the past:</l>
<l>Strong were our Syres; and as they Fought they Writ,</l>
<l>Conqu'ring with Force of Arms, and Dint of Wit;</l>
<l>Theirs was the Giant Race, before the Flood;</l>
<l>And thus, when <hi>Charles</hi> Return'd, our Empire stood.</l>
<l>Like <hi>Janus</hi> he the stubborn Soil manur'd,</l>
<l>With Rules of Husbandry the Rankness cur'd:</l>
<l>Tam'd us to Manners, when the Stage was rude;</l>
<l>And boistrous <hi>English</hi> Wit, with Art indu'd.</l>
<l>Our Age was cultivated thus at length;</l>
<l>But what we gain'd in Skill, we lost in Strength.</l>
<l>Our Builders were, with Want of Genius, curst;</l>
<l>The Second Temple was not like the First:</l>
<l>'Till You, the best <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> come at length;</l>
<l>Our Beauties equal; but excel our Strength.</l>
<l>Firm <hi>Dorique</hi> Pillars found Your solid Base:</l>
<l>The fair <hi>Corinthian</hi> crowns the higher Space;</l>
<l>Thus all below is Strength, and all above is Grace.</l>
<l>In easie Dialogue is <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s Praise:</l>
<l>He mov'd the Mind, but had no Pow'r to raise.</l>
<l>Great <hi>Johnson</hi> did by Strength of Judgment please:</l>
<l>Yet doubling <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s Force, he wants his Ease.</l>
<l>In diff'ring Tallents both adorn'd their Age;</l>
<l>One for the Study, t' other for the Stage.</l>
<l>But both to <hi>Congreve</hi> justly shall submit,</l>
<l>One match'd in Judgment, both o'er-match'd in Wit.</l>
<l>In Him all Beauties of this Age we see;</l>
<l><hi>Etherege</hi> his Courtship, <hi>Southern</hi>'s Purity;</l>
<l>The Satire, Wit, and Strength of Manly <hi>Witcherly.</hi></l>
<l>All this in blooming Youth you have Atchiev'd;</l>
<l>Now are vour soil'd Contemporaries griev'd;</l>
<l>So much the Sweetness of your Manners move,</l>
<l>We cannot Envy you, because we Love.</l>
<l><hi>Fabius</hi> might ioy in <hi>Scipio,</hi> when he saw</l>
<l><pb facs="7"/>
And join his Suffrage to the Votes of <hi>Rome;</hi></l>
<l>Though he with <hi>Hannibal</hi> was overcome.</l>
<l>Thus old <hi>Romano</hi> bow'd to <hi>Raphael</hi>'s Fame;</l>
<l>And Scholar to the Youth he taught, became.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Oh that your Brows my Lawrel had sustain'd,</l>
<l>Well had I been Depos'd if You had Reign'd!</l>
<l>The Father had descended for the Son;</l>
<l>For only You are lineal to the Throne.</l>
<l>Thus when the State one <hi>Edward</hi> did depose;</l>
<l>A Greater <hi>Edward</hi> in his Room arose.</l>
<l>But now, not I, but Poetry is curs'd;</l>
<l>For <hi>Tom</hi> the Second reigns like <hi>Tom</hi> the First.</l>
<l>But let'em not mistake my Patron's Part;</l>
<l>Nor call his Charity their own Desert.</l>
<l>Yet this I Prophesie; Thou shalt be seen,</l>
<l>(Tho' with some short Parenthesis between:)</l>
<l>High on the Throne of Wit; and seated there,</l>
<l>Not mine (that's little) but thy Lawrel wear.</l>
<l>Thy first Attempt an early Promise made;</l>
<l>That early Promise this has more than paid.</l>
<l>So bold, yet so judiciously you dare,</l>
<l>That your least Praise, is to be Regular.</l>
<l>Time, Place, and Action, may with Pains be wrought,</l>
<l>But Genius must be born; and never can be taught.</l>
<l>This is Your Portion; this Your Native Store;</l>
<l>Heav'n, that but once was Prodigal before,</l>
<l>To <hi>Shakespeare</hi> gave as much; she cou'd not give him more.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Maintain your Post: That's all the Fame you need;</l>
<l>For 'tis impossible you shou'd proceed.</l>
<l>Already I am worn with Cares and Age;</l>
<l>And just abandoning th' Ungrateful Stage:</l>
<l>Unprofitably kept at Heav'ns Expence,</l>
<l>I live a Rent-charge on his Providence:</l>
<l>But You, whom ev'ry Muse and Grace adorn,</l>
<l>Whom I foresee to better Fortune born,</l>
<l>Be kind to my Remains; and oh defend,</l>
<l>Against your Judgment, your departed Friend!</l>
<l>Let not th' insulting Foe my Fame pursue;</l>
<l>But shade those Lawrels which descend to You:</l>
<l>And take for Tribute what these Lines express:</l>
<l>You merit more; nor cou'd my Love do less.</l>

<head>PROLOGUE,</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Bracegirdle.</hi></byline>
<lg>
<l>MOors have this Way (as Story tells) to know</l>
<l>Whether their Brats are truly got, or no;</l>
<l>Into the Sea the New-born Babe is thrown,</l>
<l>There, as Instinct directs, to Swim, or Drawn.</l>
<l>A Barbarous Device, to try if Spouse</l>
<l>Have kept Religiously her Nuptial Vows.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Such are the Trials, Poets make of Plays:</l>
<l>Only they trust to more inconstant Seas;</l>
<l>So, does our Author, this his Child commit</l>
<l>To the Tempestuous Mercy of the Pit,</l>
<l>To know if it be truly born of Wit.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Criticks avaunt; for you are Fish of Prey,</l>
<l>And feed, like Sharks, upon an Infant Play.</l>
<l>Be ev'ry Monster of the Deep away;</l>
<l>Let's have a fair Trial, and a clear Sea.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Let Nature work, and do not Damn too soon,</l>
<l>For Life will struggle long, 'ere it sink down:</l>
<l>Let it at least rise Thrice, before it Drown.</l>
<l>Let us consider, had it been our Fate,</l>
<l>Thus hardly to be prov'd Legitimate!</l>
<l>I will not say, we'd all in Danger been,</l>
<l>Were each to suffer for his Mother's Sin:</l>
<l>But by my Troth I cannot avoid thinking,</l>
<l>How nearly some good Men might have 'scap'd Sinking.</l>
<l>But Heav'n be prais'd, this Custom is confin'd</l>
<l>Alone to th' Offspring of the Muses kind:</l>
<l>Our Christian Cuckolds are more bent to Pity;</l>
<l>I know not one <hi>Moor</hi>-Husband in the City.</l>
<l>I th' Good Man's Arms the Chopping Bastard thrives,</l>
<l>For he thinks all his own, that is his Wives.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Whatever Fate is for this Play design'd</l>
<l>The Poet's sure he shall some Comfort find:</l>
<l>For if his Muse has play'd him false, the worst</l>
<l>That can befall him, is, to be Divorc'd;</l>
<l>You Husbands Judge, if that, be to be Curs'd.</l>

<p>Faith 'tis a good natur'd Coxcomb, and has very Entertaining Follies—You must be more humane to him; at this Juncture it will do me Service.—I'll tell you, I would have Mirth continued this Day at any Rate; tho' Patience purchase Folly, and Attention be paid with Noise: There are Times when Sense may be

unseasonable, as well as Truth. Prithee do thou wear none to Day; but allow <hi>Brisk</hi> to have Wit, that thou may'st seem a Fool</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, why this extravagant Proposition?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>O, I would have no room for serious Design; for I am Jealous of a Plot. I would have Noise and Impertinence keep my Lady <hi>Touchwood</hi>'s Head from working: For Hell is not more busie than her Brain, nor contains more Devils, than that Imaginations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>I thought your Fear of her had been over—Is not to Morrow appointed for your Marriage with <hi>Cynthia</hi>, and her Father, Sir <hi>Paul Plyant,</hi> come to settle the Writings this Day, on purpose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>True; but you shall judge whether I have not Reason to be allarm'd. None besides you, and <hi>Maskwell,</hi> are acquainted with the Secret of my Aunt <hi>Touchwood's</hi> violent Passion for me. Since my first Refusal of her Addresses, she has endeavour'd to do me all ill Offices with my Uncle; yet has manag'd 'em with that Subtilty, that to him they have born the face of Kindness; while her Malice, like a Dark Lanthorn, only shone upon me, where it was directed. Still it gave me less Perplexity to prevent the Success of her Displeasure, than to avoid the Importunities of her Love; and of two Evils, I thought my self favour'd in her Aversion. But whether urg'd by her Despair, and the short Prospect of Time she saw, to accomplish her Designs; whether the Hopes of Revenge, or of her Love, terminated in the View of this my Marriage with <hi>Cynthia,</hi> I know not; but this Morning she surpriz'd me in my Bed.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Was there ever such a Fury! 'tis well Nature has not put it into her Sexes power to Ravish.—Well, bless us! Proceed. What follow'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>What at first amaz'd me; for I look'd to have seen her in all the Transports of a slighted and revengeful Woman: But when I expected Thunder from her Voice, and Lightning in her Eyes; I saw her melted into Tears, and hush'd into a Sigh. It was long before either of us spoke, Passion had ty'd her Tongue, and Amazement mine.—In short, the Consequence was thus, she omitted nothing that the most violent Love could urge, or tender Words express; which when she saw had no effects, but still I pleaded Honour and Nearness of Blood to my Uncle; then came the Storm I fear'd at first: For starting from my Bed-side like a Fury, she flew to my Sword, and with much ado I prevented her doing me or her self a Mischief: Having disarm'd her; in a
<pb n="4" facs="13"/>
Gust of Passion she left me, and in a Resolution, confirm'd by a Thousand Curses, not to close her Eyes, 'till she had seen my Ruin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Exquisite Woman! But what the Devil does she think, thou hast no more Sense, than to get an Heir upon her Body to disinherit thy self: for as I take it this Settlement upon you, is, with a Proviso, that your Uncle have no Children.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>It is so. Well, the Service you are to do me, will be a Pleasure to your self; I must get you to engage my Lady <hi>Plyant</hi> all this Evening, that my Pious Aunt may not work her to her Interest. And if you chance to secure her to your self, you may incline her to mine. She's handsome, and knows it; is very silly, and thinks she has Sense, and has an old fond Husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>I confess a very fair Foundation, for a Lover to build upon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>For my Lord <hi>Froth,</hi> he and his Wife will be sufficiently taken up, with admiring one another, and <hi>Brisk</hi>'s Gallantry, as they call it. I'll observe my Uncle my self; and <hi>Jack Maskwell</hi> has promised me, to watch my Aunt narrowly, and give me notice upon a Suspicion. As for Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> my wise Father-in-Law that is to be, my Dear <hi>Cynthia</hi> has such a share in his Fatherly Fondness he would scarce make her a Moment uneasie, to have her happy hereafter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>So, you have mann'd your Works: but I wish you may not have the weakest Guard, where the Enemy is strongest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p><hi>Maskwell,</hi> you mean; prithee why should you suspect him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Faith I cannot help it, you know I never lik'd him; I am a little Superstitious in Physiognomy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>He has Obligations of Gratitude, to bind him to me; his Dependance upon my Uncle is though my Means.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Upon your Aunt, you mean.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>My Aunt!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>I'm mistaken if there be not a Familiarity between them, you do not suspect: For all her Passion for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>Pooh, pooh, nothing in the World but his Design to do me Service; and he endeavours to be well in her Esteem, that he may be able to effect it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Well, I shall be glad to be mistaken; but, your Aunt's Aversion in her Revenge, cannot be any way so effectually shown, as in bringing forth a Child to disinherit you. She is Handsome and Cunning, and naturally wanton. <hi>Maskwell</hi> is Flesh and Blood at best, and Opportunities between them are frequent. His Affection to you, you have confessed, is grounded upon his Interest, that you have transplanted; and should it take Root in my Lady, I don't see what you can expect from the Fruits.</p>

<p>Were you, Son? Gadsbud much better as it is—Good, strange!

<p>Nay, I protest and vow now, 'tis true; when Mr. <hi>Brisk</hi> Jokes, your Lordship's Laugh does so become you, he, he, he.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. Froth.</speaker>
<p>Ridiculous! Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> you're strangely mistaken, I find Champagne is powerful. I assure you, Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> I Laugh at no bodies Jest but my own, or a Ladies; I assure you, Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brisk.</speaker>
<p>How? how, my Lord? what affront my Wit! Let me perish, do I never say any thing worthy to be Laugh'd at?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. Froth.</speaker>
<p>O foy, don't misapprehend me, I don't say so, for I often smile at your Conceptions. But there is nothing more unbecoming a Man of Quality, than to Laugh; 'tis such a Vulgar Expression of the Passion! every body can Laugh. Then especially to Laugh at the Jest of an Inferior Person, or when any body else of the same Quality does not Laugh with one; Ridiculous! To be pleased with what pleases the Croud! Now when I Laugh, I always Laugh alone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Brisk.</speaker>
<p>I suppose that's because you Laugh at your own Jests, I'gad, ha, ha, ha.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>Let me perish, my Lord, but there is something very particular in the Humour; 'tis true, it makes against Wit, and I'm sorry for some Friends of mine that Write, but—I'gad, I love to be malicious.—Nay, Deuce take me there's Wit in't too—And Wit must be foil'd by Wit; cut a Diamond with a Diamond; no other way, I'gad.</p>

Suppose, as I was saying, you come up to me holding your Sides, and Laughing, as if you would bepiss your self—I look grave, and ask the Cause of this Immoderate Mirth.—You Laugh on still, and are not able to tell me—Still I look grave, not so much as smile.—</p>

Is there a Vice more black!—O I have Excuses, Thousands for my Faults; Fire in my Temper, Passions in my Soul, apt to ev'ry Provocation; oppressed at once with Love, and with Despair. But a sedate, a thinking Villain, whose Black Blood runs temperately bad, what Excuse can clear? One, who is no more moved with the Reflection of his Crimes, than of his Face; but walks unstartled from the Mirrour, and straight forgets the hideous Form.</p>

How am I to behave my self? You know I am your Creature, my Life and Fortune in your Power; to disoblige you, brings me certain Ruin. Allow it, I would betray you, I would not be a Traitor to my self: I don't pretend to Honesty, because you know I am a Rascal: But I would convince you, from the Necessity of my being firm unto you.</p>

<p>Look you, Madam, we are alone,—Pray contain your self, and hear me. You know you lov'd your Nephew, when I first sigh'd for you; I quickly found it an Argument that I Lov'd; for with that Art you veil'd your Passion, 'twas imperceptible to all but Jealous Eyes. This Discovery made me bold; I confess it; for by it, I thought you in my Power. Your Nephew's Scorn of you, added to my Hopes; I watch'd the Occasion, and took you, just Repulsed by him, warm at once with Love and Indignation; your Disposition, my Arguments, and happy Opportunity, accomplish'd my Design; I prest the yielding Minute, and was blest. How I have lov'd you since, Words have not shown, then how should Words express.</p>

<p>Well, mollifying Devil!—And have I not met your Love with forward Fire?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>Your Zeal I grant was Ardent, but misplac'd; there was Revenge in view; that Woman's Idol had defil'd the Temple of the God, and Love was made a Mock-Worship.—A Son and Heir would have edg'd young <hi>Mellefont</hi> upon the Brink of Ruin, and left him none but you to catch at for Prevention.</p>

<p>Nay, Madam, I'm gone, if you Relapse,—What needs this? I say nothing but what you your self, in open Hours of Love, have told me. Why should you deny it? Nay, how can you? Is not all this present Heat owing to the same Fire? Do you not Love him still? How have I this Day offended you, but in not breaking off his Match with <hi>Cynthia?</hi> Which e'er to Morrow shall be done,—had you but Patience.</p>

<p>O' my Conscience no more we should; thou say'st right—For sure my Lord <hi>Froth</hi> is as fine a Gentleman, and as much a Man of Quality! Ah! Nothing at all of the Common Air,—I think I may say he wants nothing, but a Blue Ribbon and a Star, to make him shine, the very Phosphorus of our Hemisphere. Do you understand those Two hard Words? If you don't, I'll explain 'em to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, Madam, I'm not so Ignorant.—At least I won't own it, to be troubled with your Instructions. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Froth.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I beg your Pardon; but being Deriv'd from the <hi>Greek,</hi> I thought you might have escap'd the Etymology.—But I'm the more amaz'd, to find you a Woman of Letters, and not Write! Bless me! how can <hi>Mellefont</hi> believe you Love him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>Why Faith, Madam, he that won't take my Word, shall never have it under my Hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Froth.</speaker>
<p>I vow <hi>Mellefont'</hi>s pretty Gentleman, but methinks he wants a Manner.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>A Manner! what's that, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Froth.</speaker>
<p>Some distinguishing Quality, as for Example, the <hi>Belleair</hi> or <hi>Brillant</hi> of Mr. <hi>Brisk;</hi> the Solemnity, yet Complaisance of my Lord, or something of his own that should look a little <hi>Jene-scay-quoysh;</hi> he is too much a Mediocrity, in my Mind.</p>

<p>He does not indeed affect either Pertness or Formality; for which I like him: Here he comes.</p>

<p>My Lord, I have been telling <hi>Cynthia,</hi> how much I have been in Love with you; I swear I have; I'm not asham'd to own it now; Ah! it makes my Heart leap, I vow I sigh when I

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Froth.</speaker>
<p>O that Tongue, that dear deceitful Tongue! that Charming Softness in your Mien and your Expression, and then your Bow! Good my Lord, bow as you did when I gave you my Picture, here suppose this my Picture—</p>
<stage>[Gives him a Pocket-Glass,</stage>
<p>Pray mind my Lord; ah! he bows Charmingly; nay, my Lord, you shan't kiss it so much; I shall grow jealous, I vow now.</p>
<stage>[He bows profoundly low, then kisses the Glass.</stage>

<p>Never any thing; but your Ladyship, let me perish.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Froth.</speaker>
<p>Did my Lord tell you? Yes I vow, and the Subject is my Lord's Love to me. And what do you think I call it? I dare swear you won't guess—<hi>The Sillibub,</hi> ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p>You're thoughtful, <hi>Cynthia?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>I'm thinking, tho' Marriage makes Man and Wife one Flesh, it leaves 'em still Two Fools; and they become more Conspicuous by setting off one another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>That's only when Two Fools meet, and their Follies are oppos'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I have known Two Wits meet, and by the Opposition
<pb n="14" facs="23"/>of their Wits, render themselves as ridiculous as Fools. 'Tis an odd Game we're going to Play at: What think you of drawing Stakes, and giving over in time?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>No, hang't, that's not endeavouring to win, because it's possible we may loose; since we have Shuffled and Cutt, let's e'en turn up Trump now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>Then I find it's like Cards, if either of us have a good Hand it is an Accident of Fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>No, Marriage is rather like a Game at Bowls, Fortune indeed makes the Match, and the Two nearest, and sometimes the Two farthest are together, but the Game depends intirely upon Judgement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>Still it is a Game, and consequently one of us must be a Loser.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>Not at all; only a Friendly Trial of Skill, and the Winnings to be Shared between us.—What's here, the Musick!—Oh, my Lord has promised the Company a new Song, we'll get 'em to give it us by the way.</p>

<p>Bless me, what makes my Father in such a Passion!—I never saw him thus before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Hold your self contented, my Lady <hi>Plyant,</hi>—I find Passion coming upon me by Inspiration, and I cannot submit as formerly, therefore give way.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>How now! will you be pleased to retire, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>No marry will I not be pleased, I am pleased to be angry, that's my Pleasure at this time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>What can this mean!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>Gads my Life, the Man's distracted, why how now, who are you? What am I? Slidikins can't I govern you? What did I Marry you for? Am I not to be absolute and uncontrolable? Is it fit a Woman of my Spirit, and Conduct, should be contradicted in a Matter of this Concern?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>It concerns me, and only me;—Besides, I'm not to be govern'd at all times. When I am in Tranquility, my Lady <hi>Plyant</hi> shall command Sir <hi>Paul;</hi> but when I am provok'd to Fury, I cannot incorporate with Patience and Reason,—as soon may Tygers match with Tygers, Lambs with Lambs, and every Creature couple with its Foe, as the Poet says.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>He's hot-headed still! 'Tis in vain to talk to you; but remember I have a Curtain-Lecture for you, you disobedient, headstrong Brute.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>No, 'tis because I won't be headstrong, because I won't be a Brute, and have my Head fortify'd, that I am thus exasperated,—But I will protect my Honour, and yonder is the Violater of my Fame.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>'Tis my Honour that is concern'd, and the Violation was intended to me. Your Honour! You have none but what is in my keeping, and I can dispose of it when I please—therefore don't provoke me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Hum, gads-bud she says true.—Well, my Lady, March on, I will fight under you then: I am convinced, as far as Passion will permit.</p>

Well, you must consider of your Crime; and strive as much as can be against it,—strive be sure—But don't be melancholy, don't despair,—But never think that I'll grant you any Thing; O Lord, no;—But be sure you lay aside all Thoughts of the Marriage, for tho' I know you don't Love <hi>Cynthia,</hi> only as a blind for your Passion to me; yet it will make me Jealous,—O Lord, what did I say?

<p>Ha! How's this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>What d'ye think of being employ'd in the Execution of all her Plots? Ha, ha, ha, by Heav'n it's true; I have undertaken to break the Match, I have undertaken to make your Uncle Disinherit you, to get you turn'd out of Doors; and to—Ha, ha, ha, I can't tell you for Laughing,—Oh she has open'd her Heart to me,—I am to turn you a Grazing, and to—Ha, ha, ha, Marry <hi>Cynthia</hi> my self; there's a Plot for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>Ha! O see, I see my rising Sun! Light breaks thro' Clouds upon me, and I shall live in Day—O my <hi>Maskwell!</hi> How shall I thank or praise thee; Thou hast out-witted Woman.—But tell me, how could'st thou thus get into her Confidence?—Ha! How? But was it her Contrivance to persuade my Lady <hi>Plyant</hi> to this evtravagant Belief?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>It was, and to tell you the Truth, I encourag'd it for your Diversion: Tho' it made you a little uneasie for the present, yet the Reflection of it must needs be entertaining,—I warrant she was very Violent at first.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, I, a very Fury; but I was most afraid of her Violence at last,—If you had not come as you did; I don't know what she might have attempted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, I know her Temper.—Well, you must know then, that all my Contrivances were but Bubbles; 'till at last I pretended to have been long secretly in Love with <hi>Cynthia;</hi> that did my Business; that convinc'd your Aunt, I might be trusted; since it was as much my Interest as hers to break the Match: Then she thought my Jealousie might qualifie me to assist her in her Revenge. And, in short, in that Belief, told me the Secrets of her Heart. At length we made this Agreement, if I accomplish her Designs (as I told you before) she has ingag'd to put <hi>Cynthia</hi> with all her Fortune into my Power.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>She is most Gracious in her Favour,—Well, and dear <hi>Jack,</hi> how hast thou Contrived?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>I would not have you stay to hear it now; for I don't know, but she may come this Way; I am to meet her anon, after that I'll tell you the whole Matter; be here in this Gallery an Hour hence, by that time I imagine our Consultation may be over.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>I will; 'till then Success attend thee.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20" facs="29"/>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>'Till then, Success will attend me; for when I meet you, I meet the only Obstacle to my Fortune. <hi>Cynthia,</hi> let thy Beauty gild my Crimes; and whatsoever I commit of Treachery or Deceit, shall be imputed to me as a Merit—Treachery, what Treachery? Love cancels all the Bonds of Friendship, and sets Men right upon their first Foundations.</p>
<p>Duty to Kings, Piety to Parents, Gratitude to Benefactors, and Fidelity to Friends, are different and particular Ties: But the Name of Rival cuts 'em all asunder, and is a general Acquittance—Rival is equal, and Love like Death an universal Leveller of Mankind. Ha! But is there not such a Thing as Honesty? Yes, and whosoever has it about him, bears an Enemy in his Breast: For your Honest Man, as I take it, is that nice, scrupulous, conscientious Person, who will cheat no Body but himself; such another Coxcomb, as your Wise Man, who is too hard for all the World, and will be made a Fool of by no body, but himself: Ha, ha, ha. Well for Wisdom and Honesty, give me Cunning and Hypocrisie; oh, 'tis such a Pleasure, to angle for fairfac'd Fools! Then that hungry Gudgeon Credulity, will bite at any thing—Why, let me see, I have the same Face, the same Words and Accents, when I speak what I do think; and when I speak what I do not think—the very same—and dear Dissimulation is the only Art, not to be known from Nature.</p>
<l>Why will Mankind be Fools, and be deceiv'd?</l>
<l>And why are Friends and Lovers Oaths believ'd?</l>
<l>When each, who searches strictly his own Mind,</l>
<l>May so much Fraud and Power of Baseness find.</l>

<head>ACT III. SCENE I.</head>
<stage>Enter Lord <hi>Touchwood,</hi> and Lady <hi>Touchwood.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>MY Lord, can you blame my Brother <hi>Plyant,</hi> if he refuse his Daughter upon this Provocation? The Contract's void by this unheard of Impiety.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="21" facs="30"/>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>I don't believe it true; he has better Principles—Pho, 'tis Nonsense. Come, come, I know my Lady <hi>Plyant</hi> has a large Eye, and wou'd centre every Thing in her own Circle; 'tis not the first time she has mistaken Respect for Love, and made Sir <hi>Paul</hi> jealous of the Civility of an undesigning Person, the better to bespeak his Security in her unfeigned Pleasures.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>You censure hardly, my Lord; my Sister's Honour is very well known.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I believe I know some that have been familiarly acquainted with it. This is a little Trick wrought by some pitiful Contriver, envious of my Nephew's Merit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>Nay, my Lord, it may be so, and I hope it will be found so: But that will require some time; for in such a Case as this, Demonstration is necessary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>There should have been Demonstration of the contrary too, before it had been believ'd—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>So I suppose there was.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>How? Where? When?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>That I can't tell; nay I don't say there was—I am willing to believe as favourably of my Nephew as I can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>I don't know that. <stage>[Half Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>How? Don't you believe that, say you, my Lord?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld T.</speaker>
<p>No, I don't say so—I confess I am troubled to find you so cold in his Defence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>His Defence! Bless me, wou'd you have me defend an ill Thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>You believe it then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>I don't know; I am very unwilling to speak my Thoughts in any Thing that may be to my Cousin's Disadvantage; besides, I find, my Lord you are prepared to receive an ill Impression from any Opinion of mine which is not consenting with your own: But since I am like to be suspected in the End, and 'tis a Pain any longer to dissemble, I own it to you; in short I do believe it, nay, and can believe any thing worse, if it were laid to his Charge—Don't ask me my Reasons, my Lord, for they are not fit to be told you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>I'm amaz'd, here must be something more than ordinary in this. <stage>[Aside.]</stage> Not fit to be told me, Madam? You can have no Interests, wherein I am not concern'd, and consequently the same Reasons ought to be convincing to me, which create your Satissaction or Disquiet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="22" facs="31" ana="y"/>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>But those which cause my Disquiet, I am willing to have remote from your hearing. Good my Lord, don't press me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>Don't oblige me to press you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>Whatever it was, 'tis past: And that is better to be unknown which cannot be prevented; therefore let me beg you rest satisfied—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>When you have told me, I will—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>You won't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>By my Life, my Dear, I will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>What if you can't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>How? Then I must know, nay I will: No more trifling—I charge you tell me—By all our Mutual Peace to come; upon your Duty—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>Nay, my Lord, you need say no more, to make me lay my Heart before you, but don't be thus transported; compose your self: It is not of Concern, to make you lose one Minute's Temper. 'Tis not indeed my Dear. Nay, by this Kiss you shan't be angry. O Lord, I wish I had not told you any thing.—Indeed, my Lord, you have frighted me. Nay, look pleas'd, I'll tell you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>Well, well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>Nay, but will you be calm—indeed it's nothing but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>But what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>But will you promise me not to angry—Nay you must—Not to be angry with <hi>Mellefont</hi>—I dare swear he's sorry—and were it to do again, would not—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>Sorry, for what? 'Death, you rack me with Delay.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>Nay, no great Matter, only—Well I have your Promise—Pho, why nothing, only your Nephew had a mind to amuse himself, sometimes with a little Gallantry towards me. Nay, I can't think he meant any thing seriously, but methought it look'd odly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>Confusion and Hell, what do I hear!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>Or, may be, he thought he was not enough a-kin to me, upon your Account, and had a mind to create a nearer Relation on his own; a Lover you know, my Lord—Ha, ha, ha. Well but that's all—Now you have it; well remember your Promise, my Lord, and don't take any Notice of it to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>No, no, no—Damnation!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I swear you must not—A little harmless Mirth—Only misplac'd, that's all—But if it were more, 'tis over now, and all's well. For my Part I have forgot it; and
<pb n="23" facs="32"/>
so has he, I hope—for I have not heard any thing from him these Two Days.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>These Two Days! Is it so fresh? Unnatural Villain! Death, I'll have him stripp'd and turn'd naked out of my Doors this Moment, and let him rot and perish, incestuous Brute!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>O for Heav'ns sake, my Lord, you'll ruin me if you take such publick Notice of it, it will be a Town-talk: Consider your own and my Honour—nay, I told you you would not be satisfied when you knew it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>Before I've done, I will be satisfy'd. Ungrateful Monster, how long?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>Lord, I don't know: I wish my Lips had grown together when I told you—Almost a Twelvemonth—Nay, I won't tell you any more, 'till you are your self. Pray, my Lord, don't let the Company see you in this Disorder—Yet, I confess, I can't blame you; for I think I was never so surpriz'd in my Life—Who would have thought my Nephew could have so misconstrued my Kindness—But will you go into your Closet, and recover your Temper. I'll make an Excuse of sudden Business to the Company, and come to you. Pray, good dear my Lord, let me beg you do now: I'll come immediately, and tell you all; will you, my Lord?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>I will—I am mute with Wonder.</p>

<p>Well but go now, here's some body coming.</p>

<p>I follow instantly—So.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Maskwell.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>This was a Master-Piece, and did not need my Help—tho' I stood ready for a Cue to come in and confirm all, had ther been Occasion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>Have you seen <hi>Mellefont?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>I have; and am to meet him here about this time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>How does he bear his Disappointment?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>Secure in my Assistance, he seem'd not much afflicted, but rather laugh'd at the shallow Artifice, which so little time must of necessity discover. Yet he is apprehensive of some farther Design of yours, and has engaged me to watch you. I be¦lieve he will hardly be able to prevent your Plot, yet I would have you use Caution and Expedition.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>Expedition indeed; for all we do, must be perform'd in the remaining Part of this Ev'ning and before the Company
<pb n="24" facs="33"/>
break up, lest my Lord should cool, and have an Opportunity to talk with him privately—My Lord must not see him again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>By no Means; therefore you must aggravate my Lord's Displeasure to a Degree that will admit of no Conference with him.—What think you of mentioning me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>To my Lord, as having been privy to <hi>Mellefont</hi>'s Design upon you, but still using my utmost Endeavours to dissuade him: Tho' my Friendship and Love to him has made me conceal it; yet you may say, I threatned the next time he attempted any thing of that kind, to discover it to my Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>To what end is this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>It will confirm my Lord's Opinion of my Honour and Honesty, and create in him a new Confidence in me, which (should this Design miscarry) will be necessary to the forming another Plot that I have in my Head—To cheat you, as well as therest. <stage>Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>I'll do it—I'll tell him you hindred him once from forcing me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>Excellent! Your Ladyship has a most improving Fancy. You had best go to my Lord, keep him as long as you can in his Closet, and I doubt not but you will mould him to what you please; your Guests are so engaged in their own Follies and Intrigues, they'll miss neither of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>When shall we meet?—At Eight this Ev'ning in my Chamber; there rejoice at our Success, and toy away an Hour in Mirth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>I will not fail.</p>
<stage>[Exit <hi>L.</hi> Touchwood.</stage>
<p>I know what she means by toying away an Hour well enough. Pox I have lost all Appetite to her; yet she's a fine Woman, and I lov'd her once. But I don't know, since I have been in a great measure kept by her, the Case is alter'd; what was my Pleasure is become my Duty: And I have as little Stomach to her now as if I were her Husband. Should she smoke my Design upon <hi>Cynthia,</hi> I were in a fine pickle. She has a damn'd penetrating Head, and knows how to interpret a Coldness the right Way; therefore I must dissemble Ardour and Ecstasie, that's resolv'd: How easily and pleasantly is that dissembled before Fruition! Pox on't that a Man can't drink without quenching his Thirst. Ha! yonder comes <hi>Mellefont</hi> thoughtful. Let me think: Meet her at Eight—hum—ha! By Heav'n I have it—If I can speak to my Lord before—Was it my Brain or Providence? No matter which—I will deceive 'em all, and yet secure my self, 'twas a lucky Thought! Well this Double-Dealing is a Jewel.</p>
<p>Here he comes, now for me—</p>
<stage><pb n="25" facs="34"/>[<hi>Maskwell</hi> pretending not to see him, walks by him, and speaks as it were to himself.</stage>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>I'm glad you're come, for I could not contain my self any longer: And was just going to give vent to a Secret, which no Body but you ought to drink down.—Your Aunt's just gone from hence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>And having trusted thee with the Secrets of her Soul, thou art villainously bent to discover 'em all to me, ha?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>I'm afraid my Frailty leans that way—But I don't know whether I can in Honour discover all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>All, all Man, what you may in Honour betray her as far as she betrays her self. No tragical Design upon my Person I hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>No, but it's a Comical Design upon mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>What dost thou mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>Listen, and be Dumb, we have been bargaining about the Rate of your Ruin—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>Like any Two Guardians to an Orphan Heiress—Well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>And whereas Pleasure is generally paid with Mischief, what Mischief I do is to be paid with Pleasure.</p>
</sp>

<p>So when you've swallow'd the Potion, you sweeten your Mouth with a Plumb.</p>
</sp>

<p>You are Merry, Sir, but I shall probe your Constitution. In short, the Price of your Banishment is to be paid with the Person of—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>Of <hi>Cynthia,</hi> and her Fortune—Why you forget you told me this before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>No, no—So far you are right; and I am, as an earnest of that Bargain, to have full and free Possession of the Person of—your Aunt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>Ha!—Pho, you trifle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>By this Light, I'm serious; all Raillery apart—I knew 'twould stun you: This Evening at Eight she will receive me in her Bed-Chamber.</p>

<p>Hell and the Devil, is she abandon'd of all Grace—Why the Woman is possess'd—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>Well, will you go in my stead?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>By Heav'n into a hot Furnace sooner.</p>

<p>Mean? Not to disappoint the Lady I assure you—Ha, ha, ha, how gravely he looks—Come, come, I wont perplex you. 'Tis the only Thing that Providence could have contriv'd to make me capable of serving you, either to my Inclination or your own Necessity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>How, how, for Heav'ns sake, dear <hi>Maskwell?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>Why thus—I'll go according to Appointment; you shall have Notice at the critical Minute to come and surprize your Aunt and me together: Counterfeit a Rage against me, and I'll make my Escape through the private Passage from her Chamber, which I'll take care to leave open: 'twill be hard, if then you can't bring her to any Conditions. For this Discovery will disarm her of all Defence, and leave her entirely at your Mercy: Nay, she must ever after be in awe of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Good Fortune ever go along with thee.</p>

<stage>Enter to him <hi>Careless.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p><hi>Mellefont,</hi> get out o'th' Way, my Lady <hi>Plyant</hi>'s coming, and I shall never succeed while thou art in sight—Tho' she begins to tack about; but I made Love a great while to no purpose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>Why, what's the Matter? She's convinc'd that I don't care for her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>'Pox I can't get an Answer from her, that does not begin with her Honour, or her Virtue, her Religion, or some such Cant. Then she has told me the whole History of Sir <hi>Paul</hi>'s Nine Years Courtship; how he has lain for whole Nights together upon the Stairs, before her Chamber-Door; and that the first Favour he receiv'd from her, was a Piece of an old Scarlet Petticoat for a Stomacher; which since the Day of his Marriage, he has, out of a piece of Gallantry, converted into a Night-Cap, and wears it still with much Solemnity on his Anniversary Wedding-Night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>That I have seen, with the Ceremony thereunto belonging—For on that Night he creeps in at the Bed's Feet like a gull'd Bassa that has marry'd a Relation of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s, and that Night he creeps in at the Bed's Feet like a gull'd Bassa that has marry'd a Relation of the <hi>Gran Signior</hi>'s, and that Night he has his Arms at Liberty. Did not she tell you 
<pb n="27" facs="36"/>
at what Distance she keeps him. He has confess'd to me that but at some certain times, that is I suppose when she apprehends being with Child, he never has the Privilege of using the Familiarity of a Husband with his Wife. He was once given to scrambling with his Hands and sprawling in his Sleep; and ever since she has him swaddled up in Blankets, and his Hands and Feet swath'd down, and so put to Bed; and there he lies with a great Beard, like a <hi>Russian</hi> Bear upon a drift of Snow. You are very great with him, I wonder he never told you his Grievances, he will I warrant you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Excessively foolish—But that which gives me most Hopes of her, is her telling me of the many Temptations she has resisted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>Nay, then you have her; for a Woman's bragging to a Man that she has overcome Temptations, is an Argument that they were weakly offer'd, and a Challenge to him to engage her more irresistably. 'Tis only an inhancing the Price of the Commodity, by telling you how many Customers have underbid her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I don't despair—But still she has a grudging to you—I talk'd to her t'other Night at my Lord <hi>Froth</hi>'s Masquerade, when I'm satisfied she knew me, and I had no reason to complain of my Reception; but I find Women are not the same bare-faced and in Masks,—and a Vizor disguises their Inclinations as much as their Faces.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a Mistake, for Women may most properly be said to be unmask'd when they wear Vizors; for that secures them from Blushing, and being out of Countenance, and next to being in the Dark, or alone, they are most truly themselves in a Vizor Mask. Here they come, I'll leave you. Ply her close, and by and by clap a <hi>Billet doux</hi> into her Hand: For a Woman never thinks a Man truly in Love with her, 'till he has been Fool enough to think of her out of her Sight, and to lose so much time as to write to her.</p>

<p>Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> what a Phrase was there? You will be making Answers, and taking that upon you, which ought to lie upon me:
<pb n="28" facs="37"/>
That you should have so little Breeding to think Mr. <hi>Careless</hi> did not apply himself to me. Pray what have you about you to entertain any Bodies Privacy? I swear and declare in the Face of the World I'm ready to blush for your Ignorance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>I acquiesce, my Lady; but don't Snub so loud. <stage>[Aside to her.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Careless,</hi> If a Person that is wholly illiterate might be supposed to be capable of being qualify'd to make a suitable Return to those Obligations which you are pleased to confer upon one that is wholly incapable of being qualify'd in all those Circumstances, I'm sure I shou'd rather attempt it than any thing in the World, <stage>[Courtesies.]</stage> for I'm sure there's nothing in the World that I would rather. <stage>[Courtesies]</stage> But I know Mr. <hi>Careless</hi> is so great a Critick and so fine a Gentleman, that it is impossible for me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>O Heav'ns! Madam, you confound me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Gad's-bud, she's a fine Person—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>O Lord! Sir, pardon me, we Women have not those Advantages: I know my own Imperfections—But at the same time you must give me leave to declare in the Face of the World that no Body is more sensible of Favours and Things; for with the Reserve of my Honour, I assure you, Mr. <hi>Careless</hi> I don't know any thing in the World I would refuse to a Person so meritorious—You'll Pardon my want of Expression.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>

<p>O fie, fie, not to be named of a Day—My Lady <hi>Froth</hi> is very well in her Accomplishments—But it is when my Lady <hi>Plyant</hi> is not thought of—If that can ever be,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>O you overcome me—That is so excessive</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I swear and vow that was pretty.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>O Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> you are the happiest Man alive. Such a Lady! that is the Envy of her Sex, and the Admiration of ours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Your humble Servant, I am I thank Heav'n in a fine way of living, as I may say, peacefully and happily, and I think need not envy any of my Neighbours, blessed be Providence—Ay, truly, Mr. <hi>Careless,</hi> my Lady is a great Blessing, a fine, discreet, well-spoken Woman as you shall see—If it becomes me to say so; and we live very comfortably together; she is a little hasty sometimes, and so am I; but mine's soon over, and then I'm so sorry—O, Mr. <hi>Careless,</hi> if it were not for one thing—</p>

<stage>[Carries the Letter to my Lady and <hi>Exit.</hi></stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>A Humour of my Wife's, you know Women have little Fancies—But as I was telling you, Mr. <hi>Careless,</hi> if it were not for one thing, I should think my self the happiest Man in the World; indeed that touches me near, very near.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>What can that be, Sir <hi>Paul?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Why, I have, I thank Heav'n, a very plentiful Fortune, a good Estate in the Country, some Houses in Town, and some Mony, a pretty tolerable personal Estate; and it is a great Grief to me, indeed is is, Mr. <hi>Careless,</hi> that I have not a Son to Inherit this—'Tis true, I have a Daughter, and a fine Dutitiful Child she is, though I say it, blessed be Providence I may say; for indeed, Mr. <hi>Careless,</hi> I am mightily beholding to Providence—A poor unworthy Sinner—But if I had a Son, ah, that's my Affliction, and my only Affliction; indeed I cannot refrain Tears when it comes to my Mind.</p>
<stage>[Cries.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Why, methinks that might be easily remedied—my Lady's a fine likely Woman—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Oh, a fine likely Woman as you shall see in a Summer's
<pb n="30" facs="39"/>Day—Indeed she is, Mr. <hi>Careless,</hi> in all Respects.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>And I should not have taken you to have been so old—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Alas, that's not it, Mr. <hi>Careless;</hi> ah! that's not it; no, no, you shoot wide of the Mark a Mile; indeed you do, that's not it, Mr. <hi>Careless;</hi> no, no, that's not it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>No, what can be the Matter then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>You'll scarcely believe me, when I shall tell you my Lady is so Nice—It's very strange, but it's true: Too true—she's so very Nice, that I don't believe she would touch a Man for the World—At least not above once a Year; I'm sure I have found it so; and alas, what's once a Year to an old Man, who would do good in his Generation? Indeed it's true, Mr. <hi>Careless,</hi> it breaks my Heart—I am her Husband, as I may say, though far unworthy of that Honour, yet I am her Husband; but alas-a-day, I have no more Familiarity with her Person—as to that Matter—than with my own Mother—no indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Alas-a-day, this is a lamentable Story; my Lady must be told on't; she must i'faith, Sir <hi>Paul;</hi> 'tis an Injury to the World.</p>

<p>I warrant you, what we must have a Son some way or other.</p>

<p>Heav'n, Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> you amaze me, of all things in the World—You are never pleas'd but when we are all upon the broad Grin; all Laugh and no Company; ah, then 'tis such a Sight to see some Teeth—Sure you're a great Admirer of my Lady <hi>Whifler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sneer,</hi> and Sir <hi>Laurence Loud,</hi> and that Gang.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>I vow and swear she's a very merry Woman, but, I think she laughs a little too much.</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="40"/>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>O most ridiculous, a perpetual Consort of laughing without any Harmony; for sure, my Lord, to laugh out of Time, is as disagreable as to sing out of Time or out of Tune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. F.</speaker>
<p>Hee, hee, hee, right; and then, my Lady <hi>Whifler</hi> is so ready—she always comes in three Bars too soon—And then, what do they laugh at? For you know laughing without a Jest is as impertinent; hee! as, as—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>As Dancing without a Fiddle.</p>

<p>Just 'ifaith, that was at my Tongue's end.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>But that cannot be properly said of them, for I think they are all in good Nature with the World, and only Laugh at one another; and you must allow they have all Jests in their Persons, though they have none in their Conversation.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Brisk.</speaker>
<p>Incomparable, let me perish—But then being an Heroick Poem, had not you better call him a <hi>Charioteer? Charioteer</hi> sounds great; besides your Ladyship's Coachman having a red Face, and you comparing him to the Sun—And you know the Sun is call'd <hi>Heav'ns Charioteer.</hi></p>

<p>Right, right, that saves all.</p>

<l>Into the Dairy he descends,</l>

<p>For <hi>Susan,</hi> you know, is <hi>Thetis,</hi> and so—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Brisk.</speaker>
<p>Incomparable well and proper, Igad—But I have one Exception to make—Don't you think Bilk (I know its good Rhime) but don't you think Bilk and Fare too like a Hackney Coach-man?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. F.</speaker>
<p>I swear and vow I'm afraid so—And yet our <hi>Jehu</hi> was a Hackney Coach-man, when my Lord took him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Was that he then, I'm answer'd, if <hi>Jehu</hi> was a Hackney Coach-man—You may put that in the marginal Notes tho', to prevent Criticism—Only mark it with a small Asterism, and say,—<hi>Jehu</hi> was formerly a Hackney Coach-man.</p>

<p>My Mind gives me it won't—because we are both willing; we each of us strive to reach the Gole, and hinder one another in the Race; I swear it never do's well when the Parties are so agreed—For when People walk Hand in Hand, there's neither overtaking nor meeting: We Hunt in Couples where we both pursue the same Game, but forget one another; and 'tis because we are so near that we don't think of coming together.</p>

<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>If you had not been so assured of your own Conduct I would not—But 'tis but reasonable that since I consent to like a Man without the vile Consideration of Mony, he should give me a very evident Demonstration of his Wit: Therefore let me see you undermine my Lady <hi>Touchwood,</hi> as you boasted, and force her to give her Consent, and then—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>I'll do't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>And I'll do't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="36" facs="45"/>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>This very next ensuing Hour of Eight a Clock, is the last Minute of her Reign, unless the Devil assist her in <hi>propria persona.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>Well, if the Devil should assist her, and your Plot miscarry.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>Ay, what am I to trust to then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>Why if you give me very clear demonstration that it was the Devil, I'll allow for irresistable odds. But if I find it to be only Chance, or Destiny, or unlucky Stars, or any thing but the very Devil, I'm inexorable: Only still I'll keep my Word, and live a Maid for your sake.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>And you won't die one, for your own, so still there's Hope.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>I swear, Mr. <hi>Careless,</hi> you are very alluring—And so many fine Things, and nothing is so moving to me as a fine Thing. Well, I must do you this Justice, and declare in the Face of the World, never any Body gain'd so far upon me as your self; with Blushes I must own it, you have shaken, as I may say, the very Foundation of my Honour—Well, sure if I escape your Importunities, I shall value my self as long as I live, I swear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>And Despise me. <stage>(Sighing.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>The last of any Man in the World, by my Purity; now you make me swear—O Gratitude forbid, that I should ever be wanting in a respectful Acknowledgment of an intire Resignation of all my best Wishes, for the Person and Parts of so accomplish'd a Person, whose Merit challenges much more, I'm sure, than my illiterate Praises can description;</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p><stage>(In a whining Tone.)</stage> Ah Heav'ns, Madam, you ruin me with Kindness; your Charming Tongue pursues the Victory of your Eyes, while at your Feet your poor Adorer dies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L P.</speaker>
<p>Ah! Very fine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Still whining.)</stage> Ah why are you so Fair, so bewitching Fair? O let me grow to the Ground here, and feast upon that Hand; O let me press it to my Heart, my trembling Heart, the nimble Movement shall instruct your Pulse, and teach it to allarm Desire.</p>
<p>[Zoons I'm almost at the end of my Cant, if she does not yield quickly. <stage>(Aside.)</stage></p>

<sp>

<sp>
<pb n="37" facs="46"/>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>And must you leave me! Rather let me languish out a Wretched Life, and breath my Soul beneath your Feet.</p>
<p>[I must say the same Thing over again, and can't help it. <stage>(Aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>I swear I am ready to languish too—O my Honour! Whither is it going? I protest you have given me the Palpitation of the Heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Can you be so cruel.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>O rise I beseech you, say no more 'till you rise—Why did you kneel so long? I swear I was so transported, I did not see it.—Well, to shew you how far you have gain'd upon me; I assure you if Sir <hi>Paul</hi> should die, of all Mankind there's none I'd sooner make my second Choice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>O Heav'n! I can't out live this Night without your Favour—I feel my Spirits faint, a general Dampness overspreads my Face, a cold deadly Dew already vents through all my Pores, and will to Morrow wash me for ever from your Sight, and drown me in my Tomb.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>O you have Conquer'd, sweet, melting, moving Sir, you have Conquer'd—What Heart of Marble can refrain to Weep, and yield to such sad Sayings.—</p>
<stage>[Cries.</stage>
</sp>

<p>[I shall never contain Laughter. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I yield my self all up to your uncontroulable Embraces—Say, thou dear dying Man, when, where, and how.—Ah, there's Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></p>

<stage>Enter Sir <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Cynthia.</hi></stage>
<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Thou art my tender Lambkin, and shalt do what thou wilt—But endeavour to forget this <hi>Mellefont.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>I would obey you to my Power, Sir; but if I have not him, I have sworn never to Marry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Never to Marry! Heav'ns forbid; must I neither have Sons nor Grandsons? must the Family of the <hi>Plyants</hi> be utterly extinct for want of Issue Male. Oh Impiety! But did you swear, did that sweet Creature swear! ha? How durst you swear without my Consent, ah? Gads-bud, who am I?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>Pray don't be angry, Sir, when I swore, I had your Consent, and therefore I swore.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Why then the revoking my Consent does annul, or make of none effect your Oath: So you may unswear it again—The Law will allow it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="38" facs="47"/>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but my Conscience never will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Gads-bud no matter for that, Conscience and Law never go together; you must not expect that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> I conceive if she has sworn, d'ye mark me, if she has once sworn; it is most unchristian, inhuman, and obscene that she shou'd break it.—I'll make up the Match again, because Mr. <hi>Careless</hi> said it would oblige him. <stage>[Aside.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Does your Ladyship conceive so—Why I was of that Opinion once too—Nay if your Ladyship conceives so, I'm of that Opinion again; but I can neither find my Lord and my Lady to know what they intend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>I'm satisfied that my Cousin <hi>Mellefont</hi> has been much wrong'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside.)</stage> I'm amazed to find her of our side, for I'm sure she lov'd him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>I know my Lady <hi>Touchwood</hi> has no Kindness for him; and besides I have been inform'd by Mr. <hi>Careless,</hi> that <hi>Mellefont</hi> had never any thing more than a profound Respect—That he has own'd himself to be my Admirer 'tis true, but he was never so presumptuous to entertain any dishonourable Notions of Things; so that if this be made plain—I don't see how my Daughter can in Conscience, or Honour, or any thing in the World—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir P.</speaker>
<p>Indeed if this be made plain, as my Lady your Mother says, Child—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>Plain! I was inform'd of it by Mr. <hi>Careless</hi>—And I assure you Mr. <hi>Careless</hi> is a Person—that has a most extraordinary Respect and Honour for you, Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Aside.)</stage> And for your Ladyship too, I believe, or else you had not chang'd Sides so soon; now I begin to find it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir P.</speaker>
<p>I am much obliged to Mr. <hi>Careless</hi> really, he is a Person that I have a great Value for, not only for that, but because he has a great Veneration for your Ladyship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>O las, no indeed, Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> 'tis upon your Account.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir P.</speaker>
<p>No I protest and vow, I have no Title to his Esteem, but in having the Honour to appertain in some measure to your Ladyship, that's all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>O law now, I swear and declare, it shan't be so, you're too modest, Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Gads-bud I am transported! Give me leave to kiss your Ladyship's Hand.</p>
</sp>

<p>That my poor Father should be so very silly! <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>

<p>My Lip indeed, Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> I swear you shall.</p>
<stage>[He kisses her, and bows very low.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>I humbly thank your Ladyship—I don't know whether I fly on Ground, or walk in Air—Gads-bud, she was never thus before—Well, I must own my self the most beholden to Mr. <hi>Careless</hi>—As sure as can be this is all his doing,—something that he has said; well, 'tis a rare thing to have an Ingenious Friend. Well, your Ladyship is of Opinion that the Match may go forward.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>By all means—Mr. <hi>Careless</hi> has satisfy'd me of the Matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Well, why then Lamb you may keep your Oath, but have a care of making rash Vows; come hither to me, and kiss <hi>Papa.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>I swear and declare, I am in such a twitter to read Mr. <hi>Careless</hi> his Letter, that I can't forbear any longer—But though I may read all Letters first by Prerogative, yet I'll be sure to be unsuspected this time.—Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Did your Ladyship call?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>Nay, not to interrupt you my Dear—Only lend me your Letter, which you had from your Steward to Day: I would look upon the Account again; and may be increase your Allowance.</p>

<stage>[Bows and gives the Letter.</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>He? And wilt thou bring a Grandson at nine Months end—He? A brave chopping Boy.—I'll settle a Thousand Pound a Year upon the Rogue as soon as ever he looks me in the Face, I will Gads-bud. I'm overjoy'd to think I have any of my Family that will bring Children into the World. For I would fain have some Resemblance of my self in my Posterity, he <hi>Thy?</hi> Can't you contrive that affair Girl? Do gads-bud, think on thy old Father; Heh? Make the young Rogue as like as you can.</p>

A Thousand Pound for this Left Eye. This has done Execution in its time Girl; why thou hast my Leer Hussey, just thy Father's Leer.—Let it be transmitted to the young Rogue by the help of Imagination; why 'tis the Mark of our Family <hi>Thy;</hi> our House is distinguish'd by a languishing Eye, as the House of <hi>Austria</hi> is by a thick Lip.—Ah! when I was of your Age Hussey, I would have held fifty to one, I could have drawn my own Picture—Gads-bud I could have done—not so much as you neither,—but—nay, don't blush—</p>

<p>—O Providence, what a Conspiracy have I discover'd—But let me see to make an end on't.— <stage>(Reads)</stage> Hum—<hi>After Supper in the Wardrobe by the Gallery. If Sir</hi> Paul <hi>should surprize us, I have a Commission from him to treat with you about the very matter of Fact.</hi>—Matter of Fact! Very pretty; it seems then I am conducing to my own Cuckoldom; why this is the very traiterous Position of taking up Arms by my Authority, against my Person! Well, let me see—<hi>'Till then I languish in expectation of my Adored Charmer.</hi></p>
<stage>Dying <hi>Ned. Careless.</hi></stage>
<p>Gads-bud, would that were matter of Fact too. Die and be Damn'd for a <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi> and <hi>Iscariot</hi> both. O Friendship! What art thou but a Name! Henceforward let no Man make a Friend that would not be Cuckold: For whomsoever he receives into his Bosom, will find the Way to his Bed, and there return his Caresses with Interest to his Wife. Have I for this been pinion'd Night after Night for three Years past? Have I been swath'd in Blankets 'till I have been even depriv'd of Motion, and render'd uncapable of using the common Benefits of Nature? Have I approach'd the Marriage Bed with Reverence as to a sacred Shrine, and deny'd my self the Enjoyment of lawful Domestick
<pb n="44" facs="53"/>
Pleasures to preserve its Purity, and must I now find it polluted by foreign Iniquity? O my Lady <hi>Plyant,</hi> you were chaste as Ice, but you are melted now, and false as Water.—But Providence has been constant to me in discovering this Conspiracy; still I am beholden to Providence, if it were not for Providence, sure poor Sir <hi>Paul</hi> thy Heart would break.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Lady <hi>Plyant.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>So, Sir, I see you have read the Letter,—Well now, Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> what do you think of your Friend <hi>Careless?</hi> Has he been Treacherous, or did you give his Insolence a License to make Trial of your Wife's suspected Virtue? D'ye see here?</p>
<stage>[Snatches the Letter as in Anger.</stage>
<p>Look, read it? Gad's my Life if I thought it were so, I would this Moment renounce all Communication with you. Ungrateful Monster! He? Is it so? Ay, I see it, a Plot upon my Honour; your guilty Cheeks confess it: Oh where shall wrong'd Virtue fly for Reparation! I'll be divorced this Instant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Gads-bud, what shall I say? This is the strangest Surprize! Why I don't know any thing at all, nor I don't know whether there be any thing at all in the World, or no,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>I thought I should try you, false Man. I that never dissembled in my Life: Yet to make trial of you, pretended to like that Monster of Iniquity, <hi>Careless,</hi> and found out that Contrivance to let you see this Letter; which now I find was of your own inditing—I do Heathen, I do; see my Face no more; there has hardly been Consummation between us, and I'll be divorced presently.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>O strange, what will become of me!—I'm so amaz'd, and so overjoy'd, so afraid, and so sorry.—But did you give me this Letter on purpose, he? Did you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>Did I? Do you doubt me, Turk, Sarazen? I have a Cousin that's a Proctor in the Commons, I'll go to him instantly.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Hold, stay, I beseech your Ladyship—I'm so overjoy'd, stay, I'll confess all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>What will you confess, Jew?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Why now as I hope to be sav'd, I had no Hand in this Letter—Nay hear me, I beseech your Ladyship: The Devil take me now if he did not go beyond my Commission—If I desired him to do any more than speak a good Word only just for me; Gads-bud only for poor Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> I'm an Anabaptist, or a Jew, or what you please to call me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>Why is not here matter of Fact?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="45" facs="54"/>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but by your own Virtue and Continency that matter of Fact is all his own doing.—I confess I had a great Desire to have some Honours conferr'd upon me, which lye all in your Ladyship's Breast, and he being a well-spoken Man, I desired him to intercede for me.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. P.</speaker>
<p>Did you so, Presumption! Well, remember for this, your right Hand shall be swath'd down again to Night—And I thought to have always allow'd you that Liberty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Nay but Madam, I shall offend again if you do not allow me that to reach—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> I'm glad I've met with you, 'gad I have said all I could, but can't prevail—Then my Friendship to you has carried me a little farther in this Matter—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>Indeed—Well Sir—I'll dissemble with him a little. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>Why faith I have in my Time known honest Gentlemen abused by a pretended Coyness in their Wives, and I had a mind to try my Lady's Virtue—And when I could not prevail for you, 'gad I pretended to be in Love my self—but all in vain, she would not hear a Word upon that Subject: Then I Writ a Letter to her; I don't know what Effects that will have, but I'll be sure to tell you when I do, tho' by this Light I believe her Virtue is impregnable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>O Providence! Providence! What Discoveries are here made? Why, this is better and more Miraculous than the rest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Care.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>I can't tell you, I'm so overjoy'd; come along with me to my Lady, I can't contain my self; come my dear Friend.</p>

</sp>

<p>My Lady is just gone into my Lord's Closet, you had best steal into her Chamber before she comes, and lye concealed there, otherwise she may Lock the Door when we are together, and you not easily get in to surprize us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>He? You say true.</p>
</sp>

<p><hi>Maskwell,</hi> you are the Man I wish'd to meet.</p>

<p>I am happy to be in the way of your Lordship's Commands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>I have always found you prudent and careful in any thing that has concern'd me or my Family.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I were a Villain else—I am bound by Duty and Gratitude, and my own Inclination, to be ever your Lordship's Servant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>Enough—You are my Friend; I know it: Yet there has been a thing in your Knowledge, which has concern'd me nearly, that you have conceal'd from me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>My Lord!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I excuse your Friendship to my unnatural Nephew thus far—But I know you have been Privy to his impious Designs upon my Wife. This Ev'ning she has told me all: Her good Nature conceal'd it as long as was possible; but he perseveres so in Villany, that she has told me even you were weary of dissuading him, though you have once actually hindered him from forcing her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>I am sorry, my Lord, I can't make you an Answer; this is an Occasion in which I would not willingly be so silent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>I know you would excuse him—And I know as well that you can't.</p>

<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>Say on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I have nothing more to say, my Lord—But to express my Concern; for I think his Frenzy increases daily.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>How! Give me but Proof of it, Ocular Proof, that I may justifie my Dealing with him to the World, and share my Fortunes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>O my Lord! consider that is hard: Besides, time may work upon him: Then, for me to do it! I have profess'd an everlasting Friendship to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>He is your Friend, and what am I?</p>

<p>Fear not his Displeasure; I will put you out of his, and Fortune's Power, and for that thou art scrupulously honest, I will secure thy Fidelity to him, and give my Honour never to own any Discovery that you shall make me. Can you give me a demonstrative Proof? Speak.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>I wish I could not—To be plain, my Lord, I intended this Ev'ning to have try'd all Arguments to dissuade him from a Design, which I suspect; and if I had not succeeded, to have informed your Lordship of what I knew.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>I thank you. What is the Villain's Purpose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>He has own'd nothing to me of late, and what I mean now, is only a bare Suspicion of my own. If your Lordship will meet me a Quarter of an Hour hence there, in that Lobby by my Lady's Bed-Chamber, I shall be able to tell you more.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>I will.</p>

<p>Come, I beg your Pardon that I over-heard you, and yet it shall not need—Honest <hi>Maskwell!</hi> thy and my good Genius led me hither—Mine, in that I have discover'd so much manly Virtue; thine, in that thou shalt have due Reward of all thy Worth. Give me thy Hand—my Nephew is the alone remaining Branch of all our ancient Family; him I thus blow away, and constitute thee in his room to be my Heir—</p>

<p>No more—I have resolv'd—The Writings are ready drawn, and wanted nothing but to be sign'd, and have his Name inserted—Yours will fill the Blank as well—I will have no Reply—Let me command this time; for 'tis the last, in which I will assume Authority—hereafter, you shall rule where I have Power.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>Thou shalt enjoy it—If all I'm worth in Wealth or Interest can purchase <hi>Cynthia,</hi> she is thine.—I'm sure Sir <hi>Paul</hi>'s Consent will follow Fortune; I'll quickly show him which way that is going.</p>

<p>You oppress me with Bounty; my Gratitude is weak, and shrinks beneath the Weight, and cannot rise to thank you—What, enjoy my Love! Forgive the Transports of a Blessing so unexpected, so unhop'd for, so unthought of!</p>

think—shou'd my Lord proceed to treat openly of my Marriage with <hi>Cynthia,</hi> all must be discover'd, and <hi>Mellefont</hi> can be no longer blinded.—It must not be; nay, shou'd my Lady know it—ay, then were fine Work indeed! Her Fury wou'd spare nothing, tho' she involv'd her self in Ruin. No, it must be by Stratagem—I must deceive <hi>Mellefont</hi> once more, and get my Lord to consent to my private Management. He comes opportunely—Now will I, in my old way, discover the whole and real truth of the Matter to him, that he may not suspect one Word on't.</p>

<p>Little do you think that your Aunt has kept her Word,—How the Devil she wrought my Lord into this Dotage, I know not; but he's gone to Sir <hi>Paul</hi> about my Marriage with <hi>Cynthia,</hi> and has appointed me his Heir.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>The Devil he has! What's to be done?</p>

<p>But this is a thing of too great Moment to be so suddenly resolv'd. Why <hi>Cynthia?</hi> Why must he be Married?

<p>His Humility long stifled his Passion: And his Love of <hi>Mellefont</hi> would have made him still conceal it.—But by Encouragement, I wrung the Secret from him; and know he's no way to be rewarded but in her.

I cannot bear it, oh! what Woman can bear to be a Property? To be kindled to a Flame, only to light him to another's Arms; oh! that I were Fire indeed, that I might burn the vile Traitor to a Hell of Torments,—But he's Damnation proof, a Devil already, and Fire is his Element. What shall I do? How shall I think? I cannot think,—All my Designs are lost, my Love unsated, my Revenge unfinish'd, and fresh cause of Fury from unthought of Plagues.</p>

<p>I don't understand you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Why, I'll tell my Lord, I laid this Plot with you, on purpose to betray you; and that which put me upon it, was, the finding it impossible to gain the Lady any other way, but in the Hopes of her Marrying you.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>So—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Mel.</speaker>
<p>Excellent <hi>Maskwell,</hi> thou wert certainly meant for a Statesman or a Jesuite, but that thou art too honest for one, and too pious for the other.</p>

<p>Well, get your selves ready, and meet me in half an Hour, yonder in my Lady's Dressing-Room; go by the back Stairs, and so we may slip down without being observ'd.—I'll send the Chaplain to you with his Robes; I have made him my own,—and ordered him to meet us to Morrow Morning at St. <hi>Albans;</hi> there we will sum up this Account, to all our Satisfactions.</p>

<p>Stay, I have a doubt—Upon second Thoughts, we had better meet in the Chaplain's Chamber here, the corner Chamber at this end of the Gallery, there is a back Way into it, so that you need not come through this Door—and a Pair of private Stairs leads down to the Stables—It will be more convenient.</p>

<p>Ha! O Poison to my Ears! What do I hear!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>Nay, good my Lord, forbear Resentment, let us hear it out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I will contain, tho' I cou'd burst.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>I that had wanton'd in the wide Circle of your World of Love, cou'd be confin'd within the puny Province of a Girl. No—Yet tho' I dote on each last Favour more than all the rest; though I would give a Limb for every Look you cheaply throw away on any other Object of your Love; yet so far I prize your Pleasures o'er own, that all this seeming Plot that I have laid, has been to gratifie your Taste, and cheat the World, to prove a faithful Rogue to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>If this were true—But how can it be?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>I have so contriv'd, that <hi>Mellefont</hi> will presently, in the Chaplain's Habit, wait for <hi>Cynthia</hi> in your Dressing-Room: But I have put the Change upon her, that she may be otherwhere employ'd—Do you procure her Night-Gown, and with your Hoods tyed over your Face, meet him in her stead; you may go privately by the back Stairs, and, unperceiv'd, there you may propose to reinstate him in his Uncle's Favour, if he'll comply with your Desires; his Case is desperate, and I believe he'll yield to any Conditions,—If not, here take this; you may employ it better, than in the Death of one who is nothing when not yours.</p>
<stage>[Gives the Dagger.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. T.</speaker>
<p>Thou can'st deceive every Body,—Nay, thou hast deceiv'd me; but 'tis as I would wish,—Trusty Villain! I could worship thee.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mask.</speaker>
<p>No more,—There wants but a few Minutes of the time; and <hi>Mellefont</hi>'s Love will carry him there before his Hour.</p>

<p>I go, I fly, incomparable <hi>Maskwell!</hi></p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>So, this was a Pinch indeed, my Invention was upon the Rack; and made Discovery of her last Plot: I hope <hi>Cynthia</hi> and my Chaplain will be ready, I'll prepare for the Expedition.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>

me through the various Mazes of unheard of Treachery. My Wife! Damnation! my Hell!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>My Lord, have Patience, and be sensible how great our Happiness is, that this Discovery was not made too late.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>I thank you, yet it may be still too late, if we don't presently prevent the Execution of their Plots;—Ha, I'll do't. Where's <hi>Mellefont,</hi> my poor injur'd Nephew,—How shall I make him ample Satisfaction?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
<p>I dare answer for him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. T.</speaker>
<p>I do him fresh Wrong to question his Forgiveness; for I know him to be all Goodness,—Yet my Wife! Dam her,—She'll think to meet him in that Dressing-Room,—Was't not so? And <hi>Maskwell</hi> will expect you in the Chaplain's Chamber,—For once, I'll add my Plot too,—let us haste to find out, and inform my Nephew; and do you, quickly as you can, bring all the Company into this Gallery.—I'll expose the Strumpet, and the Villain.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Paul.</speaker>
<p>The Company, gads-bud, I don't know, my Lord, but here's the strangest Revolution, all turn'd topsie turvy; as I hope for Providence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. F.</speaker>
<p>O Heav'ns, what's the matter? Where's my Wife?</p>

<p>No, no, I mean the Family,—Your Lady's Affairs may be in a very good Posture; I saw her go into the Garden with Mr. <hi>Brisk.</hi></p>

<speaker>L. F.</speaker>
<p>That's because I have no Light, but what's by Reflection from you, who are the Sun.</p>

<p>Madam, you have Eclips'd me quite, let me perish,—I can't answer that.</p>

<head>EPILOGUE,</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Mountford.</hi></byline>
<l>COuld Poets but foresee how Plays would take,</l>
<l>Then they could tell what Epilogues to make;</l>
<l>Whether to thank or blame their Audience most:</l>
<l>But that late Knowledge does much Hazard cost,</l>
<l>'Till Dice are thrown, there's nothing won, nor lost.</l>
<l>So 'till the Thief has stoll'n, he cannot know</l>
<l>Whether he shall escape the Law, or no.</l>
<l>But Poets run much greater Hazards far,</l>
<l>Than they who stand their Trials at the Barr;</l>
<l>The Law provides a Curb for its own Fury,</l>
<l>And suffers Judges to direct the Jury.</l>
<l>But in this Court, what Diff'rence does appear!</l>
<l>For every one's both Judge and Jury here;</l>
<l>Nay, and what's worse, an Executioner.</l>
<l>All have a Right and Title to some Part,</l>
<l>Each chusing that in which he has most Art.</l>
<l>The dreadful Men of Learning all Confound,</l>
<l>Unless the Fable's good, and Moral sound.</l>
<l>The Vizor-Masks, that are in Pit and Gallery,</l>
<l>Approve, or Damn, the Repartee and Rallery.</l>
<l>The Lady Criticks, who are better read,</l>
<l>Enquire if Characters are nicely bred;</l>
<l>If the soft things are penn'd and spoke with Grace:</l>
<l>They Judge of Action too, and Time, and Place;</l>
<l>In which we do not doubt but they're discerning,</l>
<l>For that's a kind of <hi>Assignation Learning.</hi></l>
<l>Beaus judge of Dress; the Witlings judge of Songs;</l>
<l>The Cuckoldom, of Ancient Right, to Cits belongs.</l>
<l>Thus poor Poets, the Favour are deny'd,</l>
<l>Even to make Exceptions, when they're Try'd.</l>
<l>'Tis hard that they must ev'ry one admit;</l>
<l>Methinks I see some Faces in the Pit,</l>
<l>Which must of Consequence be Foes to Wit.</l>
<l>You who can Judge, to Sentence may proceed;</l>
<l>But tho' he cannot Write, let him be freed</l>
<l>At least from their Contempt, who cannot Read.</l>
