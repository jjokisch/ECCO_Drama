<p><hi>FALSE IMPRESSIONS:</hi> A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS. PERFORMED <hi>At the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden.</hi> BY RICHARD CUMBERLAND, ESQ.</p>
<l>Saepe, etiam audacem, fugat hoc terretque poëtam;</l>
<l>Quod numero plures, virtute et honore minores,</l>
<l>Indocti, stolidique et depugnare parati</l>
<l>Si discordet eques, media inter carmina poscunt</l>
<l>Aut ursum aut pugiles: his nam plebecula gaudet.</l>
<p><hi>London:</hi> PRINTED FOR C. DILLY, IN THE POULTRY, 1797. [<hi>Price</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi>]</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="prologue">
<pb facs="2"/>
<head><hi>PROLOGUE.</hi> Spoken by Mr. MURRAY.</head>
<lg>
<l>THE time hath been, but in a barbarous age,</l>
<l>When poets brav'd their audience from the stage,</l>
<l>Poets pontifical, whose lofty tone</l>
<l>Acknowledg'd no tribunal but their own,</l>
<l>And sent their Prologue-purveyor to raise</l>
<l>First fruits and fines of tributary praise.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Our modern bards are taught an humbler strain,</l>
<l>And, if less valiant, are not half so vain;</l>
<l>No longer aim the nation's taste to lead,</l>
<l>Content if they can follow and succeed.</l>
<l>Thus if the time should come, when in the place</l>
<l>Of Nature you shou'd substitute grimace,</l>
<l>(Fatal reverse!) What cou'd the Poet do?</l>
<l>Offend the many to appease the few?</l>
<l>No, if in Greece true taste had been as scarce,</l>
<l>The Stagyrite himself had stood for farce.</l>
<l>If wit thro' five long acts will not hold out,</l>
<l>Momus must help to stir the laugh about,</l>
<l>And when you crown his mummery with applause,</l>
<l>You bribe him to transgress the drama's laws.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>He were a very wild romantic elf,</l>
<l>Who only wrote to figure on the shelf;</l>
<l>To hear his own sad sentiments rebound</l>
<l>Thro' empty galleries with a dying sound,</l>
<l>And sit like Seneca in calm decay,</l>
<l>Watching how life steals drop by drop away:</l>
<l>No, let him take his profit and his ease,</l>
<l>And trifle on so long as trifles please:</l>
<l>Too weak to struggle against fashion's tide,</l>
<l>If with the current he's content to glide,</l>
<l>He only yields as Caesar did before,</l>
<l>When Tiber's torrent drove him from the shore.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The simple tale we have to tell this night,</l>
<l>Shews truth triumphant over ranc'rous spite,</l>
<l>Casts in dark shades the base defamer's part,</l>
<l>And crowns with just reward the liberal heart.</l>
<l>Oh might our efforts gain their wisht for end,</l>
<l>The gay to' amuse, the faulty to amend,</l>
<l>Make fiction rule her thoughts by nature's laws,</l>
<l>And wit exert her powers in virtue's cause,</l>
<l>Then and then only might we claim applause.</l>

<sp>
<p>AHA! very good, very good. Here I am again—no bad night's work—pretty fairish job—patient none the better, myself none the worse—tipt two guineas for sitting up with old Lady Cypress—slept comfortably in an easy chair— nibbled a cold chicken with my Lady's woman— tiff'd a can of flip with the old butler—crib'd a kiss or two from the sweet lips of Mrs. Rachel, and gave her a box of cardamums and a bottle of elder-flower water in return for the favour—So far, so good—Well done, Jerry Scud!—Holloa!

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jack.</speaker>
<p>Don't know.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>How does she do?</p>
</sp>

<p>Is she at home?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Jack.</speaker>
<p>An't sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Was she at home last night, or was she out?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jack.</speaker>
<p>Both: sometimes in, sometimes out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>You're a fool. Had she company?</p>

<p>No, no; not quite alone.</p>

<p>Jackanapes, didn't you tell me she had no company?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jack.</speaker>
<p>Yes I did; because why? she bade me let no company in; yet she wasn't quite alone by herself, because young Squire Algernon was alone with her.</p>

<p>The devil and his dam! I'm done for. Get out of my fight! begone! away with you!</p>

<stage>PETER <hi>enters.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Peter.</speaker>
<p>Is there any alteration to be made in Lady Cypress's medicines?</p>

<p>None at all, none; draughts <hi>sicut ante.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>They do no good.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>They do no harm.</p>

<speaker>Peter.</speaker>
<p>They are a mere chip in porridge—Conserve of roses will never cure an asthma.</p>

<p>Miserable man that I am; my Jenny tête-a-tête with Harry Algernon!—a rake, a rogue, a rantipole. Hah! here she comes—</p>
<stage><hi>Enter Mrs.</hi> SCUD.</stage>
<p>Light of my eyes, joy of my heart, fair as a lily, come to my arms! Out all night—sigh'd for my darling—counted the minutes—terrible long absence—how did you bear it?—Doubt you've been lonesome—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Not at all; far from it. Harry Algernon has been here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>What does he want? Nothing to say to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>But you'll hear what he has to say to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Let him say it to me only. Not fit company for jewel Jenny.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Ridiculous! He only wants a little of your interest with Lady Cypress.—Apropos! he has brought you half a buck.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Let him take his half buck home again. Wou'dn't name his name to Lady Cypress for all the venison in his father's park.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Hav'n't you nam'd his name to Lady
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
Cypress? I doubt you have, Jerry, oftener than you ought, and in a way you shou'd be asham'd of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Only said what lawyer Earling said—always had the law o' my side.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>On which side was truth? on which side was gratitude? Recollect yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>What shou'd I recollect?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you.—Your adventure at Barnstable races, when in the pride of your heart you must shew off in your new gig forsooth; and where wou'd you have been now if the very man you have defam'd hadn't sav'd your life at the peril of his own?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>He did, he did—I don't deny it. Tit run restive—tipt me over a wheelbarrow—tumbled under his heels—might have been kick'd to atoms— surgeon's work as it was—snapt my arm—well it was not my neck—much obliged to Harry Algernon—never spoke against him since.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Speak for him, man; 'tisn't enough you do not speak against him: liberate your conscience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Jenny, Jenny, liberate my conscience, as you call it, and I shall liberate my customers; if Harry Algernon will be a rantipole; if his women and his wine, his racing and his revelling, have cross'd him out of the old lady's books, how am I to blame?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, 'tisn't your business to set the worst side of his character to view; you have benefited by his courage and humanity—why don't you talk of them, and hold your tongue about his frailties?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>My tongue can do nobody any harm.
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
I tell you it is all up with him: lawyer Earling has done his business. If ever he enters my lady's doors, or touches a shilling of her fortune while he breathes, set me down for a fool and a false prophet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Suppose he does not aim at touching a shilling of her fortune; suppose he only wants— but here he comes, and will tell you what he wants.</p>
</sp>
<stage>ALGERNON <hi>enters.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Jerry, my worthy fellow, give me your hand, give me your help.—No, no, that's not the point at present—take your fingers off my pulse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Very high, let me tell you—very full— gallops at a furious rate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Expectation raises it, hope quickens it; love is my disease; and if you don't stand my friend, disappointment will be my death.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Love! Can't cure love—troubled enough to cure the consequences of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Hark ye, Jerry, you are an intimate of Lady Cypress; I, though her nearest of kin, am an exile. Within her castle lives the idol of my soul, Emily Fitzallan; obtain for me an interview with her, and though you can't cure love, you may rescue me from death, and then you may fairly boast of having sav'd one man's life by your practice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Can't do't—not possible—fair Emily never goes out of the castle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Therefore it is I want to go into it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Hopeless case—not upon the chances— Old Lady won't bear to look upon you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I'll excuse her if I may but look upon the young one: manage that for me, my good fellow.—
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>
Nobody knows me; nobody can find me out; I'm a stranger to the whole family.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>And so you are likely to remain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, Jerry, cast about; be good natur'd, and contrive some errand or pretence to introduce him. If there is a little danger, surely you may risque it for the preserver of your life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Foolish scheme, jewel Jenny, foolish scheme.—Won't do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Have you no medicines to send in? Can't I personate your pestle and mortar-man?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Not you; I keep no such pestle and mortar-man in my shop.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>But you keep a heart in your body, and a memory in your brains, therefore you must stand for me as I have stood for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Hush! here comes Simon Single, the keeper of the castle. Leave me with him, and I warrant I have a key to his castle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Angel of my hope, into your hands I commit my cause.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Aye, aye, leave your cause, and quit your company.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exeunt</hi> SCUD <hi>and</hi> ALGERNON.</stage>
<stage>SIMON SINGLE, JENNY SCUD.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Welcome, welcome, my good friend!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Glad to see you, pretty Mrs. Jane.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>So you are taking your rounds this fair morning, Mr. Simon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Better take them than Jerry's doses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>So wou'd not they perhaps.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>And how are all cronies at the castle? How does the venerable virgin Mrs. Buckram,
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>
pretty Rachel Williams, and the rest of the fair nuns?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Name 'em not; you have not left your fellow. What is Rachel Williams? a baby.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Well, but Mrs. Buckram—she is no baby.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>No, o' my word; she is of the race of the Anakims.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>No matter for that, friend Simon; you'll marry Buckram.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>No, no, that buckram shall never stick in my skirts. Harapha of Gath wou'dn't marry her. I am no knight-errant to encounter giants.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>I shou'd think so; for if you were a true knight, you wou'd not sleep before you had set free your lovely prisoner, Emily Fitzallan.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>There's one a-coming will do that. Fair Emily will be a wife before you'll be a widow. Young Montrath is the man for her; he's expected every day with his uncle Sir Oliver. It is all agreed upon, and my lady's whole fortune will be settled on Miss Emily. There's a start for you—there's a sally from dependance to prosperity; from wanting every thing to possessing all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>And nothing left to Harry Algernon?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Yes, patience if he possesses it, and an ill-name whether he merits it or not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Well, I can't see the justice of all this.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Who can, where lawyer Earling is concerned? That puppy of an attorney lords it over the whole castle; and now we are in the bustle of setting out Miss Emily in a stile before Sir Oliver arrives. There are fine dresses to be made, fine
<pb n="8" facs="11"/>
apartments to be furnished, and fresh servants to be hir'd for the heiress.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Say you so? fresh servants? Are you full? If not, I can recommend you such a lacquey—the very man of men—Jerry shall bring him to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Bring him yourself; lead him over in a white bridle, and let me judge of his points and his paces.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>You shall—my life for your's, Miss Emily will be charm'd with him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Adieu! time flies when I am with you. Once more, adieu! I shall expect you. I hope you are happy with your little doctor; but I must think you were much too fine a flower to be pluckt by an apothecary, and stuck into a gallipot.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>He's off; you may come out of your hiding hole; the coast is clear.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ALGERNON, <hi>followed by</hi> SCUD.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Now, my fair advocate, what have you done for me? Is there any hope?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Of the old lady's fortune, none; your aunt has not left you a shilling.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I'm glad of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>I wonder why.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Miss Emily is to have the whole.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I'm sorry for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>I wonder wherefore.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you then. Had my aunt bequeath'd to me her fortune, she wou'd have probably restricted me from marrying Emily; having given it to Emily, she has doubtless tied her up from marrying me. Had she done neither one nor the other, I have enough to maintain her, and the prize had been my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>And so she shall; I've a project for your meeting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I doubt if I ought to seek it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Very true; lay it aside altogether; it will bring a plaguy deal of mischief upon me, and do no good to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Tell it me however.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>You'll comprehend it at once. There is a proper valet to be hir'd for the heiress, fit to wait upon her person, and grace the back of her chair at table.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I can't do it; I am not equal to the task; I can't approach so near, and yet refrain. When she spoke to me, I shou'd be lost; when she look'd on me, I shou'd betray myself; and when I handed her the plate, I should present it on my knee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Aye, then you wou'd be vollied out of the window, and I kick'd out of the doors. Now, silly Jenny, what's become of your project?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Hold there! tho' dangerous in the extreme it is not altogether desperate. If I cannot undertake the offices you describe, I may yet present myself as a candidate for her service; and in that character perhaps obtain an interview with my charmer. That hope is worth an effort.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>It isn't worth a farthing, and will be pounds and pounds out of my way. Cursed scrape, foolish Jenny, cursed scrape!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>But where shall I get a proper dress to appear in?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>No where; you can't appear at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Fear nothing; I'll provide you with a dress.</p>

<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Egad, she has a provision for every thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Who but must conquer that is armed by the fair? There is a rascal in the family, Earling by name, who has slanderously defam'd me; I'll wring his ears from his head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>Take care; Earling is an attorney, and if he has any ears you will pay for wringing them; if he has none, you'll be puzzled to lay hold of them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Come, Jerry, I see what staggers you; you are afraid of losing the old lady's custom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>You are right; I am. She takes physic, and you take pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Mark me! I'll not promise you to swallow as many medicines as she does; but, come what will, I'll guarantee you against all losses incurr'd on my account; so fear nothing, but come on. Discretion I can't boast of, but in honour I will never be found wanting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>That's enough, that's enough! Deal upon honour and I am with you. I love to do a good natur'd action when there's nothing to be lost by it.</p>

<p>Enter, enter, Mr. Earling: you come upon a wish.</p>

<p>Ever prompt to approve myself your ladyship's most devoted and most absolute humble servant, upon a wish I come, upon a word I vanish.</p>

<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>I am dumb.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Have you the memorandums about you, that I dictated?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>If my tears have not defac'd them. Believe me, gracious lady, when I saw my own name set down to a bequest so munificent, I was cover'd with blushes, I was choak'd with gratitude.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Out with it then, out with your name, if such is the effect, and write in Algernon's; I warrant gratitude will not choak him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>Good, very good! Your ladyship has the gift of rallying me in the most pleasant way out of my metaphors. Choak is a figure somewhat of the strongest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Why yes, and I shou'd think you may venture upon the legacy, and risque the effects of it; so copy out your paper when you please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>I'll set my clerks upon it out of hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>You'll set the world upon it when I'm out of it, for you have totally cashier'd Harry Algernon, and he is the son of my sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>And your sister was the wife of his father, and his father was your unremitting persecutor, who vex'd you with a suit in chancery for ten long years, and ten might have been added to ten, had it not been that I—I speak modestly of myself; I am no egotist—I speak simply of number one, and nobody else, for your barrister was a cypher—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>But a cypher put to number one adds no trifle to its value; so the upshot is, you gain'd the suit, and I paid the costs—a victory little to be envied—and, after all, is it just and equitable the son should suffer for the father's faults?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>O jus et aequum! as if he had not faults enough of his own to warrant your exclusion of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>I have heard enough of his faults I confess, if you are correct in describing them. If you have deceiv'd me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>I! I deceive you! I defame your nephew! I who have never spoke of his offences but with regret and sorrow; never brought a story to your ears, but with the view of intercepting malice and softening down impressions; I deceive you! then where is truth and virtue?</p>

<sp>

<p>Approach, my dear! Come near me. I must talk with you. Well! You have been to see the apartment I have newly furnished—and do you like it, Emily?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>'Tis elegant in the extreme—'tis sumptuous.</p>

<p>For me such finery?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Child of my heart, for you. All I possess is your's.</p>
</sp>

<p>I hope you will not tempt me to forget that I was poor and humble.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>I hope not: nature has endow'd you with admirable qualities; prosperity, I trust, will not pervert them. It does not quite come on you by surprize: you cou'd not well suppose I shou'd adopt the son of my most unrelenting persecutor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>I did not dare to reason in that case.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>But you must know how worthless in himself, how undeserving of my favour is he, who, in respect of consanguinity, is the only person that cou'd supersede you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>You speak of Mr. Algernon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>I do; I speak of him, whom no one speaks of but with reproach and scorn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>I do confess I've heard much evil speaking, but 'twas from one who shou'd have more respect for truth and decency than to traduce the nephew to the aunt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean? Wou'd you defend a libertine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>No, madam, I defend no libertine; but you will not be angry if I avow that I detest a libeller. If he, who thus has poison'd your opinion, knows not the character, the manners, habits, sentiments, connections, perhaps not even the outward form and feature of the man, whose fame he mangles, can I be to blame if I implore you, for the love of justice, to hear before you strike?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>What is this, Emily? What is this warmth?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Honest, not prudent; out of time and place, but still sincere, tho' rash.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>You call on me to hear before I strike; I now demand if you that strike have heard?
<pb n="14" facs="17"/>
Do you know Algernon? Have you convers'd with him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I have.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>You have! when, where? he comes not hither; never was admitted, never will be, within these doors. Astonishing that you shou'd dare to tell me you have made acquaintance with this profligate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Hear my defence.—You gave me leave to pass a little time, for change of air after my late confinement, at your Hill-farm. One evening I had rambled about a mile from home, when upon entering a little copse, thro' which my footpath led, judge of my horror, when a villain, such I must call him, surpriz'd me, seiz'd me, and in spite of cries, prayers and entreaties—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Merciful providence! what do you tell me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>A dreadful tale I shou'd have had to tell, or died ere I cou'd tell it, had not heaven sent me a rescue, a brave brave preserver, who with a soul all fire, and motion quick as lightning, sprung on the assailant, grasp'd him in his arms, and after a contention, furious tho' short, hurl'd him to the ground, breathless, and maim'd with bruises.— Which of these merits the name of <hi>profligate?</hi> Not be that sav'd me—It was Algernon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Algernon do you say? My worthless nephew Algernon! Take care!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Renounce me if I tell you an untruth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>I'm all astonishment. Who was the assailant?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I know not. Your heroic
<pb n="15" facs="18"/>
nephew bore me half dead and fainting to my house; 'twas not till then I knew him to be Algernon. He staid with me no longer than till the care of the good people had recovered me: the next morning I return'd to the castle, fearing to remain any longer in so solitary a place. Of Algernon, I saw no more. Now suffer me to ask, is this the conduct of a profligate?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a strange story.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a true one, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Why have you kept it to yourself thus long? You've been return'd two days.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Because until this hour I have not seen your spirits in a state to bear the slightest agitation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>And do you think the agitation slight that I now suffer? No, I see your danger, Emily; I see your weak credulity, and much I fear you'll find yourself the dupe of Algernon. What business cou'd he have at my Hill-farm?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Madam, your tenant's wife nurs'd Mr. Algernon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>She never shou'd have nurs'd you, Emily, or harbour'd you one moment, had I known it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>That's hard; but I must suffer and be silent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Be silent then, and go to your chamber; there you may meditate on what you have been, and call to mind, with timely recollection, what you may be again.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>MASTER Gawdry, Master Gawdry, have I not said the word, and will not the word that I have said serve and suffice to put thee out of doubt, that Isaac thy son, thy son Isaac, will not do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gawd.</speaker>
<p>I pray you now, Master Simon Single, be kind-hearted, and consider of it. I shou'd be main proud to have him in my lady's livery; he's a docile lad, and can turn his hand, as I may say, to any thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Let him turn it to the plough; he's a bumpkin: let him drive the team and dung the land; he's born to it: let him ring the hogs, and tend the stye, and toil in the drudgery of his vocation. Nature never fashion'd him to be the lacquey of a lady—You are answer'd, farmer Gawdry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gawd.</speaker>
<p>Aye, Master, I am answer'd, but I am not heard. I hann'a told you half the things my boy can do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>What can he do? Unfold!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gawd.</speaker>
<p>A power—Speak for yourself, Isaac; tell the gentleman what you can do.</p>

<p>A'looks so grave, a'daunts me.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Gawd.</speaker>
<p>What shou'd daunt thee, boy? Don't hang thy head, but up, and tell him boldly what can'st do.</p>

<speaker>Isaac.</speaker>
<p>I wull, father, I wull.—I can sing psalms, shoot flying, worm the puppies, cut capons, climb the rookeries, and make gins for polecats.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Wonderful! and can't you eat and drink, and sleep and snore abundantly? Can't you wench when you have an opportunity, swear now and then upon occasion, and lie a little when it serves your purpose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isaac.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, I know something of all these matters.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gawd.</speaker>
<p>I told you he was fit to wait upon any lady in the land.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Upon any lady but the lady Cypress he is welcome; upon her he may wait long enough before he gets any other answer than I've given you. <hi>Dictum est</hi>—Good morning to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gawd.</speaker>
<p>Good morning to me indeed! How long, I trow, have you been this great man, to carry yourself in your geers so stately? I can call to mind the day when you came into this family as mere a bumpkin as you think my boy to be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Keep your temper, neighbour Gawdry, keep your temper; mount your steed, amble homewards, visit your <hi>oves</hi> and your <hi>boves,</hi> comfort your good dame, and present my humble service to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Gawd.</speaker>
<p>I won't comfort her; I won't present your humble service to her; I don't find you are so willing to do her any service, and as for humble, it don't belong to you—but mark my words—time is at hand—county election's coming on—ask me for a plumper then, do; ask me, I say, for a plumper

<p>Sir, you have all the right in life to say it; for if none else will give us a good word, we must e'en praise ourselves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>A sharp wit, let me tell you.—Harkee, Henry, your name I know; the place from whence you come I do not know; your qualifications remain to be prov'd, and your character I dare say, if it is of your own giving, will be an excellent good one.</p>

<p>Of the lower house she is the lady. Make your best bow to Mrs. Dorothy Buckram, but don't be too aspiring; if you offer to salute her you are a lost man; that blessing don't fall to my lot above once in a twelvemonth, and some would not aspire even to that.</p>

<p>What is this ribaldry that you are talking? and who is this young man?</p>

<p>What is his name.</p>

<p>A gentle name, soothing and soft, I much approve of Henry: I've ever had a prejudice for Henry.</p>

<p>Simon is sweeter.</p>

<p>Jerry is more brisk.</p>

<p>Sweet Simon—simple Simon—why 'ts music—it is a lute.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>But Jerry sounded in F sharp's a trumpet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Yes, truly, in the ears of a hen-peck'd husband when his partlet cackles.—But can't this youngster speak? Henry shou'd speak like Henry; let us hear you. Were I the mistress you aspir'd to serve, what wou'd you say to me?</p>

<p>Silence becomes a servant; 'tis a virtue; but if I were your equal and your lover.—</p>

<p>Ah, then what wou'd you say?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Then if you stood all tempting as you are, full in my sight, and cheer'd your happy swain with smiles so lovely, languish so alluring.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>What wou'd you do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I'd snatch you to my heart, press you, caress you, smother you with fondness.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>And so you will; let go, or I'll scream out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Bravo; you'll do—A very good rehearsal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>A very villanous one, if my Jenny has had a part in it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>I give you joy, young man; your fortune's made.</p>

<p>I'll never sign those deeds in her behalf till she consents to marry as I'd have her. Indeed, indeed, you have sav'd me, my good Sir, from a most rash and inconsiderate measure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>Now is the time; I'll seize the happy moment.—My ever honour'd lady, I but live to save and serve you; my whole life has been devoted to your happiness; the founder of your fortune, I have fought your battles manfully, and stood a siege as long as that of Troy in your defence; aye, and wou'd die in it if need requir'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>There is no need—I know your services, and at my death you'll find I have not underrated them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>She melts—I'll strike.—Not at your death, dear lady, (may that be far, far off!) but with your life reward me.—Hah! that tells she yields to the impression.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>How with my life? You have my good opinion; you have my friendship; what more can I do for you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="23" facs="26"/>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>Think of me only as I think of you. Why shou'd a thankless girl engross your fortune? Use it; employ it; many happy days are yet in store for you. When the Lord Cypress married you he was your senior by a pretty many years more than your ladyship is mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Your inference from that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>I dare not quite reveal it. I wou'd wish your ladyship to take it to your thoughts. A hint, a word, a look, so it were kind, wou'd greatly help me to declare it to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>We'll talk no more at present, if you please; you will remember you're my agent, Sir; and I will not forget your services.—Good day to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>May every day and every hour be happy as I cou'd wish them, and you will be blest.—'Twill do—her pride is dropping from the perch—she totters; I shall catch her.</p>

<p>Scudamore, an please you; so he gives in himself.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>So I shou'd guess. What leads you now to seek it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>The ambition of belonging to your ladyship; but I wou'd answer more directly, might I presume.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>I understand you. Simon, leave the room. <stage><hi>Exit</hi> SIMON.</stage> You seem embarrass'd. Was it not your wish to speak to me in private?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Madam, it was.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>And what have you to impart, that one, who possibly may be your fellow servant, might not be privy to?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I am a gentleman by birth; that being known amongst my fellow servants might chance to raise an evil mind against me, and make my humble station painful to me; your candour will not think the worse of me because I am unfortunate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="25" facs="28"/>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>No, not the worse in charity of thought, but I cannot employ you in my service. No gentleman must wait upon that lady, to whom I else perhaps had destin'd you. —No gentleman at least of your appearance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I'm sorry for it—but it is my fate to be judg'd by appearances, and condemn'd by reports.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>If you have fallen into this decay by mere misfortune, or injurious treatment, I can pity you; nay, Henry Scudamore, if that's your name, and if I knew your story (which at present I have not time to hear) I cou'd do more—I cou'd (and something whispers me I wou'd) consider your necessities, and help you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I am the victim, madam, of a villain. My story is soon told, for it is founded on a simple fact, which I can make appear to full conviction, if you will condescend to give me hearing, and suffer me to state such evidence, as cannot be oppos'd by my defamer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>I know not what to say to that, young man; I have no strength to spare for other's burthens, and am already loaded with my own, even to the breaking down of my weak frame. If 'tis a case of pity, I've a hand that's open to your wants without enquiry; if it is matter of grievance and redress, I wou'd recommend you to state it to my lawyer, Mr. Earling, and he shall see you righted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I humbly thank you; I will state it to him, and trust the goodness of your heart will see me righted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Ah! I've no heart, no health, no nerves to hear you. You must excuse me, Henry
<pb n="26" facs="29"/>
Scudamore. I dare not undertake to arbitrate; but wait Sir Oliver Montrath's arrival, and he shall hear you; he's a noble gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Where shall I wait the whilst?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Where? Let me see—yes, you may stay this night here in the castle. My old servant, Simon, will entertain you at the second table. Does that content you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I were most unthankful if it did not.</p>

<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Rachel!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Madam! what are your commands?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Don't answer me in that stile. I have so long been a dependant, and liv'd in such familiarity with you, my good Rachel, in particular, that, tho' you are my servant, I don't wish you to use a language to me so submissive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Whatever language you wou'd have me use, so it will but convey the same respect, I will endeavour to conform to it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>I wou'd fain keep upon such terms with fortune, that I may fall back to my former poverty without a pang; therefore, if ever you perceive me giddy with prosperity, recal my recollection to the low situation I emerg'd from, and do it honestly, my girl; don't spare me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>You'll want no monitor to warn you against pride, and yet, as you require sincerity, there is one warning I conceive is needful just at this crisis.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>State it without reserve.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="27" facs="30"/>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Are you not now in danger of incurring your patroness's most severe displeasure?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps I am; but be explicit with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Your champion Algernon, has he not left a thorn in that soft heart?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>If you call gratitude a thorn, he has.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Are you quite sure 'tis only gratitude? May it not soon be love? Nay, give me leave— is it not love already?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Well, if it is, how can I strive against it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Prudence will tell you how.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Prudence will tell me an old gossip's tale, but who, that is in love, will hear her out?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Are you aware how fatal it will be to all your expectations, if my lady discovers your attachment?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Are you aware how natural it is to love the man who saves you from destruction? My lady gives me riches, Algernon rescues my life and honour; I was lost but for his courage; I am only poor without her bounty; and if she demands that I shou'd sacrifice my heart's affections, she makes conditions that I cannot grant, nor wou'd her fortune bribe me to the attempt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Do you know Mr. Algernon's character?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Does he that blackens it? What does my lady know but what that lawyer instils into her ear? Infamous man! And why does he defame him? why, but because he may retain his power in the estate, and garbel it at pleasure? Besides, he has an ample legacy; believe me, I hold it a disgrace to read my name in the same page with his; nor wou'd I be his partner in the crime of plundering
<pb n="28" facs="31"/>
Algernon, but that I live in hopes the time will come when I may render back the unlawful spoil.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Then temporize the whilst, my dearest lady, or that time never will be your's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>'Tis right; you counsel well; and now I will confide a secret to you: I have warn'd Algernon who is his enemy, and what base stories have been forg'd against him.—Ah! who is this? 'Tis he, 'tis he himself!</p>
</sp>
<stage>ALGERNON <hi>enters.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Hush! not so loud.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Your name was on my lips. How came you here? How did you gain admission, and what have you in view by this disguise? You may disclose; this friendly girl is secret.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Then let her stay; I wou'd not be surpriz'd in private with you. I am here by sufferance of Lady Cypress; I have seen my aunt for the first time, convers'd with her, and lodg'd a plea for further hearing when her friend, Sir Oliver Montrath, shall be at leisure: one of his servants is already come; he may be soon expected.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>And his nephew, does he accompany him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I did not ask that question of the servant, but if you wish it I will make the enquiry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>No, let it pass. I know your aunt expects him.—Hark, Rachel, somebody is at the door —see who it is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Madam, there's nobody, nor any sound that I can hear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Stand where you are and listen!—What is the meaning of this dress you wear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I put it on to counterfeit a servant, or, I shou'd rather say, to ask for service—Will you not
<pb n="29" facs="32"/>
try me, Emily? don't take my character from that attorney; I'll serve you honestly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>You serve! you're jesting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Am I not your servant? I am your faithful servant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>My heroic preserver—that is your rightful character, and by that title you have a claim upon my gratitude, which only can expire with life— and now inform me what you have in view by this adventure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I am not so romantic as to think I can maintain my post longer than till to-morrow, to which time I have a furlough by authority; if fortune stands my friend I may effect something within that period; but even now am I not supremely blest to see you, hear you, and behold that face, that was of late so pale and wan with terror, restor'd to all the lustre of its charms?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>That face, assure yourself, will never be turn'd from you to league with those who seek to rob you of your fame and fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I am not robb'd of what enriches you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>The heart, that swells with indignation against all that wrong you, had but for you been cold and motionless.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Oh Emily, forbear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>This and no more—I never will be made the slave of interest or dupe of slander. My confidence in you cannot be shaken, my obligations cannot be computed. The life that I possess is of your giving—What can I say but that I live for you?— Now leave me, Henry; not a word, but leave me.</p>

<p>Welcome, most welcome! May I trust my senses? This is above hope that you and I should live to meet again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>My ever dear, my ever honour'd lady!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Time has gone lightly over you, my friend! You, that have travers'd sea and land, are whole; I, that have tempted neither, am become a shatter'd wreck on shore.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Not so, not altogether so, thank heaven! Time is a surly guest, whose courtesy does not improve by long acquaintance with us; but we'll not rail at him since he permits us once more to meet.—And here's the same old castle still unspoilt by modern foppery; aye, and the same old grand sires firm in their frames with not one wrinkle more than when I parted from them years ago.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Aye, years indeed—but you have fill'd them up with glory; your's has been a life of themes for future history, a field of laurels to adorn your tomb—mine has been tame and simple vegetation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>I have liv'd a soldier's life; but, heaven
<pb n="31" facs="34"/>
be thank'd, I've plunder'd no nabob, stript no rajah of his pearls and pagodas, nor have I any blood upon my sword, but what a soldier's honour may avow—but you have here a relict of my gallant comrade major Antony Fitzallan. He was wounded by my side, carried off the field, and died in my arms. With his last breath he bequeath'd ('twas all he had to bestow) a blessing to his daughter, and charg'd me, if I liv'd to come to England, to thank you for your charity, and be a friend to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>I trust you'll find her worthy of your friendship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Is she good, is she amiable? Has she her father's principles, her mother's purity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>See her and judge; she's naturally sincere—but where's your nephew? where is Mr. Lionel? — I reckon'd with much pleasure upon seeing him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my good lady, there I am unfortunate. I had built upon the hopes of presenting him to you; but it cannot be at present. Poor Lionel is indispos'd, and must bear his disappointment with what philosophy he can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>The disappointment is reciprocal—a little time I hope will bring him to us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>I wish it may—but look! who comes—</p>

<sp>

<p>My dear, this is Sir Oliver Montrath, mine and your father's friend; as such you'll honour him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="32" facs="35"/>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>As such I claim the privilege to embrace and press her to my heart. My child, my charge, devolv'd upon me by a father's legacy, when breathing out his gallant soul in prayers and blessings for his Emily.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Oh sir, was you, was you beside him at that dreadful moment?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>I was, my child! these arms supported him, cover'd with wounds, and crown'd with victory—alas! how dearly purchas'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Then let his last commands be ever sacred; if you have any such in charge to give me, impart them, I conjure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>I have none but blessings to impart. In fortune's gifts the hero had no share, in virtue's he abounded. In the care of this your generous benefactress he had left you; to that and heaven's protection he bequeath'd you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>I am content; and what before I ow'd in gratitude to this beneficent and noble lady, I now will pay with filial obedience and duty superadded. Suffer me, dearest madam, from this moment to call myself your daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>As such I have adopted you; remember now, my child, the duty you have taken on yourself, the authority you have consign'd to me. All rights parental center now in me; your happiness, your credit, your establishment, are trusts for which I am responsible.—You have no other task but to obey.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Obedience, madam, has its limitations; but such as I would render to my father I'll pay to you. Have I your leave to withdraw?</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Exquisite creature! I'm enchanted with her. By heaven! 'twould be the heighth of my ambition, the object I have most at heart in life, to see my Lionel—Oh that I cou'd!—here kneeling at her feet.—Born of such parents, train'd by such instructions, and grac'd with charms so lovely, Emily, without a fortune, is a match for princes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>If such is your disinterested wish (and greater happiness I could not pray for) I trust my fortune thrown into her scale will not make her appear less worthy of your nephew, or cause you to retract your good opinion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>No, surely; but I doubt if I should wish your fortune to go out of the right channel even to Emily. We that have never married should regard our nephews as our sons.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>But does affinity impose on me an obligation to bestow my property on one that merits nothing, to the wrong of her that merits all?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Is that the character of Algernon? Is he so undeserving?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Ah there, my friend, there is my terror; the destiny I dread; the man of all men living the most dangerous to my peace is Algernon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Preserve my Emily from him—save her from Algernon!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Is Algernon then born to be a curse to both of us?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="34" facs="37"/>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Explain yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>He is your nephew, therefore I was silent, but if he's dangerous to your peace of mind, to mine he's fatal—in one word, the wound of which my hapless Lionel now languishes was given by the hand of Algernon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Horrible wretch!—his murderer.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>I say not that; for modern courtesy gives not that name to duellists, and honour sanctifies their bloody deeds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Away with all such honour! Truth disavows it, nature revolts from it, religion denounces it—Oh! he is born to be my shame and torment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Be patient for a while; suspend your judgment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>No, I regard a duellist with horror; I hold him as an agent of the enemy of mankind, sent to disturb society, and rend the parent's and the widow's hearts asunder: one action, one only action, and that a doubtful one, had met my ear in favour of that wretch whom I call nephew, and henceforth even that one I totally discredit, and renounce him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Hold, I conjure you. In the midst of wrath let us remember justice. I, like you, abhor a duellist profest; yet I am taught by long experience how to make allowances for younger spirits, and warmer passions, that will not submit to meet the world's contempt, and scorn its prejudices.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Away! you talk this language by profession; reason declares against it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Reason demands that we should pause
<pb n="35" facs="38"/>
in judgment. When two men draw their swords upon each other, reason will tell us one must be to blame; but ere we six the blame upon that one, justice decrees that we should hear them both.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>What says your nephew? He will speak the truth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>I should expect he would; yet I'll not wholly trust to any man's report against another in his own cause; and in this sentiment my nephew honourably coincides, for he declines all answer to my questions, and will state nothing to affect or criminate his antagonist—Hah! who is this?</p>

<p>No; he made offer of his services, but upon talking with him I perceiv'd he had a list of grievances to state, and not being then at leisure, I believe I told him he might wait your coming, and make his suit to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>And so he may—his looks plead in his cause. Is it your wish to speak with me, young man?</p>

<p>Alone, if you'll permit it.</p>

<p>I'm curious what this man can have to tell me. Do you conjecture?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>There is a mystery about him. He says he is a gentleman by birth, and so far I believe him. Of what he had to tell besides I wav'd the hearing, but offer'd him relief: that did not seem his object, nor was it mine to take a gentleman into my service. But you will know the whole—shall we adjourn and see what is become of Emily?</p>

<p>For speaking about characters you've no concern with; therefore I pray you, sir, take mine in hand, and do me justice. I suspect some villain has cruelly defam'd me.—Doesn't an action lie for that at law?</p>

<p>I'll set him in the stocks; I'll have his ears nailed to the whipping post.</p>

<p>No, don't do that; if whipping-posts had ears, they'd hear the cries of those that are tied to them, and pity them.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Why that's his proper place: back-biting is his trade.</p>

<p>And what's my trade, do you think? where shall I drive it? my gallipots may grow into the shelves for everlasting, if I'm to be made the cat's-paw of your schemes and foolish Jenny's—but I'll go tell my lady all about you.</p>

<p>Aye, but consider what an ornament your ears are to your head, and you'll lose them incontinently if you betray me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>My ears indeed! look to your own; the lawyer has sworn to nail them to the whipping post. I've got a wig, so have not you, my master. Besides, I'm not quite certain but my lady's custom will be the greater loss.—She takes a world of physic.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>I see you have; I see 'tis supernaculum, for some of it has got under your wig already.</p>

<p>He has vow'd my ruin too, and that is one of the few vows that he will keep religiously.</p>

<p>I would I had the cooking of one dose for him. I wish he'd swallow that. It shou'd be a settler.</p>

<p>What has he done by Harry Algernon? There's malice for you; there's a batch of mischief,

blasted his character, garbled his fortune, and turn'd my lady's heart to stone against him.</p>
</sp>

<p>Flint, iron, adamant—I told her so— Madam, said I, the gentleman is wrong'd; the neighbours, where he lives, all give him a good word, the gentry love him, his father doats on him, the poor adore him: there is but one bad character 'twixt him and your attorney—Judge you, said I, which party it belongs to.</p>

<p>Now, Emily, you see what misery that wicked man has brought upon us all.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="44"/>

<p>I'm sorry for Sir Oliver's misfortune.</p>

<p>I hope you have also pity for the sufferer.</p>

<p>I trust I have for all that merit it.</p>

<p>I'm sure Mis's Emily will not attempt to extenuate the guilt of such an action.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>You may be sure I never will defend a guilty person, knowing him for such; be you as careful how you criminate an absent man, till you have proofs against him. <stage><hi>To Sir</hi> OLIVER.</stage> Sir, you are silent; I should wish to know if you have any thing to urge against him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Nothing, my dear, I'm listening with attention, and therefore silent. I should be sorry were you less unwilling to give up your opinion of a man who render'd you such service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>What service? Earling, you have heard the story; let us hear what you have to say upon it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>If Miss Fitzallan will suffer me to put a simple question to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>By all means; put your question.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>When Mr. Algernon, by happy chance, came in so opportunely to her rescue, can Miss Fitzallan say what brought him thither so far from his own home?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>I never ask'd what caus'd him to be there, nor did he tell me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>We'll call it then a very happy chance without a cause, or a most fortunate presentiment that somewhere in that grove there would be found a damsel in the power of some vile ruffian, whom he was doom'd to rescue. Some people might suppose
<pb n="42" facs="45"/>
this a collusion, but Miss Fitzallan can remove all doubts by telling us who was the villain that offer'd her that violence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Can you do this, my Emily?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>I cannot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>Did Mr. Algernon know who he was?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>I do not think he did.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>Did he secure his person?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>No; his care was wholly turn'd to me▪ the man he left upon the ground, and, as it seem'd, disabled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>I have done: I leave it to the court to judge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>A barefac'd trick. It is too palpable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Who can say that?—Let Mr. Algernon speak for himself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>Speak!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Aye, you have spoke, and should not he? That's justice, is it not?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>Did you always find it so where you have been, Sir Oliver?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Whether I found it so or not, I felt it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Now, Mr. Earling, you may put those questions, you've press'd on me, to Mr. Algernon. Perhaps he'll answer them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Emily, Emily, you forget yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I should, if I forbore to speak, when charges such as these are urg'd against an absent, therefore a defenceless, man. You have not allow'd him to approach you, madam; this gentleman, equally unknown to him, prejudges him at once; he is ingenious to find out bad motives for good actions; there's not a virtue in the human
<pb n="43" facs="46"/>
heart but may be metamorphos'd by such cunning into a vice. Sir Oliver has said, and said it in the language of a hero—<hi>Let Mr. Algernon speak for himself.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>And I repeat those words.—Let him be heard!—However circumstances bear against him, and wretched tho' he has made me, still I hold it matter of conscience never to prejudge, however strong the grounds of my suspicion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Sir Oliver, we do not think alike, and therefore with your leave we'll cut this subject short. Emily will retire—a little recollection will be useful to shew the error of some rash opinions and amend them. Go, child, remember I have now a right to look for the obedience of a daughter.</p>

<p>Oh! come in, come in, young man! I promis'd you a hearing, and I'll make good my word; but as my mind is press'd with many matters, be short and to the point.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="44" facs="47"/>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I will. Your nephew has had an affair with Mr. Algernon, and is wounded. You have visited him no doubt. Has he related to you the particulars of that unpleasant business?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Before I answer, let me know who it is that questions me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>My father lives upon the lands of Sir George Algernon, and I have some acquaintance with his son, the person whose unlucky chance it was to wound your nephew.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>And what's your motive for the question that you now put to me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I am no stranger to your character, and if you know the circumstances of that duel, I trust you will not suffer Mr. Earling to misrepresent them to the Lady Cypress.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliver.</speaker>
<p>Certainly I shou'd not, if I knew the truth, suffer it to be disguis'd; but I have no particulars from my nephew. The affair remains a mystery. Can you develope it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>If Lady Cypress will permit me to stay this night, as she has promis'd, and you can bring me to an explanation with her in your presence, I can so far elucidate this mystery, that if you still persist to trace it home you shall have full possession of the means.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>I hardly should expect it at your hands; nor where my nephew's honour is concern'd shall I be easily induc'd to listen to other evidence than that of facts, incontrovertibly attested, and (I am free to say) admitted on his part.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>'Tis to such facts and such authorities I shall appeal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="45" facs="48"/>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>And do you mean to criminate my nephew?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, sir, I have no other meaning but to declare the truth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Have you the means to know it? Was you present at the rencontre?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>If it appears that I have not the means to know the truth, or knowingly disguise it, treat me as I deserve; I'm in your hands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, I'll urge no further questions on you, but use my interest with the Lady Cypress to procure you the interview you wish. Now fail not on your part: you know me, sir; I trust to you unknown.</p>

<p>I'm arm'd against that charge.</p>

<p>Pretty well for that. You've had a sip or two with honest Simon.</p>

<p>Simon's a fish; Dame Buckram is a leech; fills where she fastens, and delights in suction: I honour her for her absorbent qualities, and I pronounce that they are silly apes and ignoramusses that say wine gets into the head—'tis false—I say it gets into the heart; it drives ill humour, melancholy, treason, and a whole gang of cowardly companions out of a man, as a carminative does crudities and indigestion: it wou'd have set my constitution clear, only there's one thing sticks—</p>

<p>No, no, no, my lady; 'tis not because he is in your interest we are leagued against him— your interest has been ever dearer to me than my own. If you turn me out of your doors this night, I can lay my hand upon my heart, and appeal to the Giver of it, that I never wrong'd you of a farthing; and, tho' a poor servant, scorn to cringe and lie and vilify an absent man, as he has done.

<p>You shall not doubt me—There's your nephew's paper—No eye but your's has seen it from my hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Sir!—Mr. Algernon—I ask your pardon—I am satisfied—but can you be unknown, and in this house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I never enter'd it before this day, nor to my knowledge ever saw my aunt 'till I appear'd before her in this habit, which I shall now put off—but hark! we shall be interrupted here— Can't we retire to a more private place?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>WELL, well, well! jewel Jenny, here we are for the last time: farewell visits, to be sure, are melancholy matters; but we have many good friends in the castle still, and tho' I am thrown out of the cabinet, I have kept up my interest in the kitchen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Aye, and in the county too, when it shall be known that you have forfeited my lady's favour by speaking up for Mr. Algernon; he is so much pitied and belov'd by all men, that your neighbours will sham sick on purpose to employ you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scud.</speaker>
<p>To say the truth, I have sometimes thought that was my lady's only complaint; but I took care my physic should not cure her of it; and my comfort is that nobody of the faculty will profit by my loss; for when she leaves off my medicines she'll find herself too well to employ a doctor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, Jerry, she'll not leave off you nor your medicines. If you can get to the speech of her, a little coaxing, and a submissive apology, will set all things right.</p>

<p>Hark ye, my friend, if it is not your own, bad is your best. Let us have no false feathers. Where did you get this suit?</p>
</sp>

<p>'Tis Harry Algernon's. He and I wear the same cloaths: one tailor serves us both—Isn't it true, Jerry?</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>Then I'll inform you. Here are but two of you in company that do not know me; you are both my friends, my generous, zealous friends, for which I thank you, and come in person hither to convince you that Algernon is not that worthless man, which calumny has painted him to be.</p>

<p>Hang him, polecat, I'll smoke him out of it. Oh! the inconceivable lies that miscreant has told of a gentleman he does not know even by sight. I pray you, sir, don't discover yourself to him, till we have had him up before my lady—
<pb n="63" facs="66"/>
Methinks I hear her say, Simon, I am convinc'd that lawyer is a rascal—Turn him out!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buck.</speaker>
<p>Aye, we'll all lend a helping hand to that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Yes, or a helping foot, if that is wanted. I have one at his service.</p>
</sp>

<p>Bless you, my worthy master, bless you heartily! I hope I have said nothing to affront you; I was a little by the head just now, but that's over.</p>

<p>So is not my remembrance. I shall ever prize you as my best of friends.</p>

<p>Right, and where truth unfolds her standard, victory must follow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>And what should follow victory? What but the glorious prize for which I struggle? that prize which fortune, aiming to impoverish, has only made more rich in my esteem—that generous heart, that sacrific'd for me interest, for which so many sacrifice themselves. Now call to mind those words so heavenly sweet, which you left with me, whilst the ingenuous blush glow'd on your cheek—"Henry, I live for you!"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Ah! that was then the only way I had to reinstate you in your property; and, tho' it cost a blush to say those words, still I could say them, for I scorn'd to rob you—but to repeat them now wou'd be—Oh heaven!—it would be every thing but false, my Henry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>Then let me take that truth into a heart, of which no human power can dispossess you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>I hope not, Henry, for take that away and I am poor indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>'Tis your's for ever—and believe me, dear one, if my too credulous aunt has not outliv'd her reason, she will see the injustice of her own decisions and revoke them. For my exclusion she may have some plea; our families have been at suit for years, and law will cut asunder closer ties than those existing between her and me; but of her motives for discarding you, take my word, Emily, she'll soon repent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>It is not that I fear her worthless favourite; the wretch has brought a storm upon his head, and has already had some heavy shocks—but my worst fears point to another quarter.</p>

<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I understand you. 'Tis Montrath you dread.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>I could not temporize; I spoke too plainly. Indignant of the claim she made upon me, I set her power too boldly at defiance, and challeng'd her to cancel her bequest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>You must consult Sir Oliver upon this: I cannot speak upon Montrath's affair even to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>I see you either cannot or you will not, therefore I ask no questions, well persuaded you never would take arms against the life of any man and know yourself in fault.</p>

<p>I think I do; I have cause to know him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Ah, sir, you speak so mournfully, I fear you have found no comfort in your visit to your nephew.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Small comfort—Yet the danger of his wound is much abated.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Then I'm afraid you have, or think you have, some cause of anger against Algernon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>No, Emily, no anger against him. You cannot think too well of Algernon, tho' I could wish you had not put your thoughts in language quite so warm.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>'Twas indiscreet, but that defamer urg'd me, and put me off my guard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="66" facs="69"/>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Cou'dn't you find another and a stronger cause that put you off your guard? Is there not a certain passion, which our hearts are subject to, that neither keeps a guard upon itself, nor suffers any to be kept against it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>If I should answer that as truth would prompt me, shou'dn't I expose myself to another reproof for want of caution?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>No; for so far from thinking with my lady, that you have chosen ill, I think with you that you could no where make a better choice—And more than this—was your brave father living, and knew what I know of your Algernon, he would approve your judgment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>As I am sure you would not give that name but to a sacred truth, what you have said sanctions the character of Algernon—but does it warrant me in suffering him to make a sacrifice of interest by marrying a beggar?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>You point the question wrong, and should have ask'd if it exculpates me, your father's friend, for suffering you to call yourself a beggar.— No, my dear child, it does not, nor will I permit it to be said, the daughter of the generous Fitzallan, who in the battle found me faint with wounds, and whilst he cover'd me receiv'd his death, wanted that dross which I abounded in.—This, Emily, this never should be said; so come with me, and don't oppose one word to my resolves; for in an act of honour I will pause at no man's bidding, no, my pretty one, nor yet at any woman's, tho' grac'd with all the charms that heaven can give her.</p>

It now remains to sweep those menial vermin out my way, those insects that annoy me: old Sir Oliver, that blusters about justice, is a hypocrite; he cannot be a friend to Algernon; and yet he troubles me, takes up my seat at table, occupies the ear of the old lady, and obstructs my suit, which stood so fair, that if I could but seize one lucky moment, one fair opportunity. —Hah!

<p>Most amiable, most excellent of ladies, whom with my heart I serve, honour, obey and worship; I want words to speak my gratitude.—Thus at your feet in humble adoration let me seal on this dear hand the pledge, the sacred pledge, of my unutterable, my unbounded love.</p>

<sp>

<p>Madam, I cannot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>I can help your memory if you have lost the word. 'Twas <hi>love, unbounded love.</hi> When you had gone so far out of all bounds, all measure of respect, can the appearance of these silly people deter you from proceeding?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>Madam, if you're offended, I have done. I'll humbly take my leave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>No, sir, I must insist upon your staying. Tho' you are foil'd to add a single word to insolence so perfect and complete, yet you shall not be robb'd of your just right, that nature gives you, to be heard in vindication of your own assertions. If you have spoke the truth, and nothing but the truth, of Algernon, his character cannot be rescued, let the fate of your's be what it may.</p>

<p>Any thing the matter, Mr. Attorney? Afraid you are not quite well just now. You look a little pale.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Hold your tongue, foolish fellow! you, Simon, in the first place, and you next, mistress, who dare to tell me I am made the dupe of false impressions, are you not both asham'd to look this injur'd gentleman in the face?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>It is a face to make a man asham'd, and we did blush to see him on his knees before your ladyship.</p>

<p>That's my affair, fall down on your's and ask forgiveness of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Pray, madam, don't command me to do
<pb n="69" facs="72"/>
that, for fear I never should forgive myself.—I ask your pardon for approaching you when I was tipsey, but you bade me drink, and I was over eager to obey you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>That's easily forgiven; but your abuse of this gentleman, whom I must still call the friend of truth, is monstrous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Madam, if that gentleman is the friend of truth, he makes very free with his friend truly. I only said he told lies to your ladyship, that's no abuse, for here come those an prove it.</p>

<p>I claim your promise to give him hearing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>I protest against him; that fellow's an impostor: we shall not listen to his evidence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>He first came here humbly to ask for service, pleaded decay, and said he was a gentleman by birth; I pitied him, and offer'd him relief. He now has chang'd his dress, shifted his character, and claims to be an advocate for Algernon. These are suspicious circumstances, and I shou'd have some better reasons for believing him than I am yet possess'd of. Do you know any such, Sir Oliver?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="70" facs="73"/>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>Aye, sir, do you know who this champion is?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Sir, give me leave to ask—Do you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>Not I; I know him not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Yet you know Algernon, are intimate with all his habits, frailties, faults, offences—have look'd into his heart, and kindly told the secrets you discover'd.—Oh thou slanderer! Now look him in the face, and prove your charge.—Well may you start—Mark his confusion, madam!—This is your nephew, this is Algernon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Yes, on my honour, and my brave preserver.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>I am confounded.—Where is that defamer?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Simon.</speaker>
<p>Madam, he has stept aside to mend a flaw in his indictment.—How do you do, Mr. Attorney? Come forward, if you please, and get acquainted with this gentleman's face. You knew him well enough behind his back.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Peace! let me hear what Algernon will say in his own cause.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Speak for yourself, brave Algernon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>I am that exil'd man, whom, on the word of this defamer, tho' unknown to him even by sight, it seems, you have proscrib'd. Despairing of admission to your presence, and driven in self-defence on this resource, I took a counterfeited character, and saw what I had never been allow'd to approach— your person. Much I wish'd to speak in mitigation of your prejudice, and give a plain recital of my wrongs; but you had then no ear for such discourse, and I was told to wait your better leisure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="71" facs="74"/>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>All this is true—proceed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>A friend here present told me I was accus'd to you of various crimes and gross enormities. I plead to failings, to the common errors and indiscretions youth is subject to, but, I trust, I have never degraded my character or debas'd my principle; I am no gamester, as he makes me to be; no dissipater of my paternal fortune, as he insinuates; no libertine, as he asserts; and, let me add, in the hearing of Sir Oliver Montrath, I am no assassin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>It is now my duty, and a painful one I feel it, to bring to light, in vindication of an injur'd character, the guilty person, for whose shameful act no better palliation can be found than temporary madness and intoxication. The monster, from whose brutal violence the purest of heaven's creatures was preserv'd by Algernon, how shall I speak it without shame and horror! was Lionel Montrath.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>I am confounded and amaz'd! Montrath!—This, if not told by you, Sir Oliver, wou'd mock belief.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Your nephew was too noble to disclose it, tho' he has in his hands a written paper sign'd by the offender for his vindication. This, I believe, he never has discover'd, even to that lady, tho' a party in it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>Never, but constantly evaded my enquiries.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>To this when I shall add, that my rash nephew forc'd the duel on him in consequence of blows exchang'd between them, I trust I may with
<pb n="72" facs="75"/>
safety rest his cause upon the facts adduc'd—unless indeed this gentleman has any other charge, which in his modesty he will prefer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>You'll not draw any thing from me, Sir Oliver; you may talk on; I prefer silence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>You are right; 'tis time your tongue had some repose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Pray do not keep him longer in my sight. My nephew does not seem to hold him worthy of a retort.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alg.</speaker>
<p>No, madam, I have nothing to return him for his malicious slander, but my contempt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>If he can feel, 'tis punishment enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Be gone! your infamy go with you; and may no part of it adhere to your profession.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Earl.</speaker>
<p>Let my profession look to itself—There are some understandings in this world made, it should seem, by nature to be duped. Had you not been so easy of belief, I had not been so forward to deceive you. Now put what name you will upon my conduct, there are such glaring instances in point, of dealers in seduction, infamy, and false impressions on credulity, as make my shame no wonder.</p>

<speaker>Lady Cyp.</speaker>
<p>Now, Henry, you've appeal'd to me for justice—hear my decree. There is your destiny; that is the prize which you have nobly earn'd. My heart, so long estrang'd, is now your own. You are my son, and Emily my daughter; all I possess is your's—Have I aton'd?</p>

<p>Yes, I will let you kneel, my child, for now thou hast a treasure worth thy thanks— Be virtuous, loving, faithful to each other; ape not the fashions of this guilty world; seek pleasures where alone they can be found, in nuptial harmony, domestic duties, and that sweet reflection, which fortune well employ'd is sure to give.—Rise, my adopted, rise!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Oliv.</speaker>
<p>Oh, let me add a blessing—May you be—Well, well, it will not forth; my heart's too full; but I will send it up in thought towards heaven— Here, Emily, my love, I'll put the first chain on your bridal arm; they are pure pearls, my child; not spoils of war, but gifts of gratitude for life preserv'd —wear them for my sake, and when I am dead cast a kind look upon them, and drop one pearly tear, richer than them all, to the memory of old Oliver.</p>

<l>To keep his critics ever in his sight;</l>
<l>Such jaunts might turn their brains, disturb their thinking,</l>
<l>And send them where they'd lose the art of sinking.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Rigour, when just, he can, he will endure,</l>
<l>The stream is bitter, but the spring is pure;</l>
<l>Candor, when candor haply he can meet,</l>
<l>Like Moses' rod, can turn the bitter sweet;</l>
<l>But the foul puddle, in which malice dips,</l>
<l>Is a dire dose—He spurns it from his lips.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>He writes, because, tho' writing is abus'd,</l>
<l>The world is not too grave to be amus'd;</l>
<l>He writes, and ever to some moral end,</l>
<l>Because the world is not too good to mend.</l>
<l>Soft female hearts are prone as wax to melt,</l>
<l>And, true or false, impressions will be felt;</l>
<l>Youth's yielding clay too easily receives</l>
<l>The featur'd stamp that cross-ey'd cunning gives:</l>
<l>Therefore let her, whose dang'rous lot in life</l>
<l>Hangs on the balance betwixt maid and wife,</l>
<l>Lay those few short prescriptions to her heart,</l>
<l>With which the Lady Cypress clos'd her part;</l>
<l>For base seduction spreads on every side</l>
<l>His treach'rous snares to mesh th' unwary bride.</l>
<l>She, in whose eyes enticing Cupids play,</l>
<l>Gives impudence the clue, and leads the way.</l>
<l>What tho' the faithless husband quits her hand,</l>
<l>Truth, like a column, of itself can stand:</l>
<l>To reas'ning minds sufficient strength is giv'n,</l>
<l>And none but fools can charge their faults on heav'n.</l>
