<p>LORD RUSSEL; A TRAGEDY, OF THREE ACTS.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="preface">
<pb facs="277"/>
<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>I HAVE endeavoured to delineate, in the following Drama, an exact portrait of the noble Personage, whose name it bears; as I believe, that a more engaging model of public and private virtue can hardly be selected from the annals of any nation: although the extreme mildness of his temper, the simplicity of his manners, and, above all, his unaffected piety, are such qualities, as are very rarely admitted in the formation of a Tragic Hero.</p>
<p>To render my performance interesting to my country, I have adhered as closely to our history, as the nature of dramatic composition allowed me to do; and in points where I have varied from historical truth, such variations are, I trust, supported by dramatic probability.</p>
<p>In the spirited and judicious introduction to the latelypublished letters of Lady Russel, the testimony of different Historians is collected concerning the sentiments of Charles the Second and his brother, on the impending fate of Lord Russel.</p>
<p><pb n="268" facs="278"/>In the Duke of Monmouth's Journal, it is said, that the King told him, he inclined to have saved the Lord Russel, but was forced to consent to his death, otherwise he must have broke with his brother the Duke of York.
—Kennet.</p>
<p>The sentence just quoted, is, I hope, a sufficient foundation for the conduct which I have assigned to Charles; whose character indeed was such, that fiction can hardly impute to him any instance of irresolution, duplicity, and falsehood, which the tenor of his life will not bring within the limits of theatrical credibility.</p>
<p>The candid reader will readily allow the liberty I have taken, in laying the scene in the Tower, after Russel's condemnation; as it affords many advantages to the conduct of the play.</p>
<p>In compliance with that respect, which dramatic authors have lately paid to the Clerical character, I have not introduced either Tillotson or Burnet among the persons of the drama, though the latter was so constant an attendant on the captivity of my Hero; an omission which I have in some degree supplied, by the introduction of Mr. Spencer; a character drawn from the printed
<pb n="269" facs="279"/>
trial of Lord Russel, where the name of that gentleman appears in the list of those, who gave an honourable evidence in behalf of the noble prisoner.</p>
<p>I have many obligations to the journal written by Burnet, at the request of Lady Russel, which contains all the minute circumstances that occurred, during the imprisonment, and at the execution of her Lord. This very interesting and pathetic narrative is printed in the General Dictionary, under the article Russel. I have not only taken from it many of the sentiments, which I have assigned to him in this Tragedy, but I have sometimes adopted the very words, that were, really uttered by Lord Russel; and this I have done, not only from an affectionate admiration of his character, but from a despair of surpassing the elegant simplicity, and the force of his expression.</p>
<p>The offer relating to his escape, so generously made, and so nobly refused, is a fact universally known, and must render the names of Cavendish and Russel an honour to our country, as long as magnanimity and friendship retain their just value in the estimation of mankind.</p>

<stage>Bedford <hi>and</hi> Lady Margaret Russel.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>REST here, my gentle Father! nor again</l>
<l>Expose your wearied age and wasted spirits</l>
<l>To scenes of such dread influence to shake</l>
<l>Each fibre of a heart that feels like yours!—</l>
<l>I pray you rest with me!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>My tender child!</l>
<l>Thanks to thy filial aid! my strength returns,</l>
<l>And my reviving soul has gather'd force</l>
<l><pb n="272" facs="282"/>To bear the killing sight.—'Tis true, when first</l>
<l>I saw my mild and unoffending son,</l>
<l>Pride of my age! and England's dear resource</l>
<l>In these disastrous days! when I beheld</l>
<l>My blameless Russel at that bar arraign'd,</l>
<l>Where only guilt and infamy should stand;</l>
<l>When I beheld each servile judge support</l>
<l>A lawless jury basely fram'd against him,</l>
<l>Indignant anguish robb'd my wounded heart</l>
<l>Of vital energy: quick from the court</l>
<l>My hasty friends hurried my senseless frame,</l>
<l>To this our quiet home: but since, my daughter,</l>
<l>Thy kind endearing cares have now restor'd me,</l>
<l>I will resume my station by thy brother,</l>
<l>In these distressful moments:—to his side</l>
<l>Affection calls me, and paternal duty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Forgive me, that I dare to thwart your wish,</l>
<l>But from my generous brother I've receiv'd</l>
<l>A kind injunction to detain your age</l>
<l>From that afflicting scene. He has engag'd</l>
<l>To tell us, by repeated messengers,</l>
<l><pb n="273" facs="283"/>Each petty circumstance that passes there.</l>
<l>Already from the number of his friends</l>
<l>He has selected one to bring us tidings:</l>
<l>His faithful Spencer comes.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Spencer.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>What from my Son?—</l>
<l>The sentence is not pass'd!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPENCER.</speaker>
<l>No, my dear lord.</l>
<l>England is yet unsullied with the stain</l>
<l>That must disgrace her, if the sword of Justice</l>
<l>Turns to the murderous dagger of Revenge,</l>
<l>To stab your virtuous son.—By his request</l>
<l>I come to soothe your anxious sufferings,</l>
<l>And to relate the process of a scene,</l>
<l>Where he conjures you to appear no more.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>What perjur'd slaves have they suborn'd against him?</l>
<l>How far has truth been wrong'd, and law been tortur'd,</l>
<l>To frame those snares of legal death, in which</l>
<l><pb n="274" facs="284"/>They labor to involve incautious virtue?</l>
<l>Have they not dealt most hardly with my son?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPENCER.</speaker>
<l>He has experienc'd subtle cruelty</l>
<l>From venal ruffians in the robes of justice;</l>
<l>But the base wrong his patient worth endures,</l>
<l>Is the dark foil which gives the diamond lustre.</l>
<l>When he requested aid for his defence,</l>
<l>His keen insidious foes, who strongly fear'd</l>
<l>Some upright advocate might save their victim,</l>
<l>Enjoin'd him to employ a servant's hand.</l>
<l>There rose indeed a servant at his side,</l>
<l>Most eager for the task; but O! what words</l>
<l>Can speak the fond surprize, and thrilling anguish,</l>
<l>Which shook the bosom of each sad spectator,</l>
<l>Who in that servant saw his lovely wife?</l>
<l>The crowd, with eyes bedimm'd by starting tears</l>
<l>Of tenderest admiration, gaz'd upon her,</l>
<l>And murmur'd kindest prayers, as they beheld</l>
<l>Connubial love, in that angelic form,</l>
<l>Thus firmly yielding unexpected succour</l>
<l>To virtue struggling in oppression's toils.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="275" facs="285"/>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Most excellent of women! worthy offspring</l>
<l>Of my departed friend, the good Southampton!</l>
<l>If Tyranny prevails against thy husband,</l>
<l>How shall the wretched Bedford's feeble age</l>
<l>Support thy widow'd heart? I can no more</l>
<l>Than in strict fellowship of bitterest sorrow</l>
<l>Echo thy groans, and mourn our mutual loss.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Do not, dear father, do not yield so soon</l>
<l>To comfortless despair!—we yet may hope</l>
<l>The radiant probity of Russel's life</l>
<l>Will dissipate each dark and dangerous cloud</l>
<l>That perjur'd Calumny can raise around him.</l>
<l>Remember all the candor of his mind!</l>
<l>Think how his temperate virtues have been prais'd</l>
<l>By Envy's self! how to the gaze of youth</l>
<l>His conduct has been held up as a book,</l>
<l>In which all English eyes may read their duty,</l>
<l>And learn the fairest path to spotless honour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPENCER.</speaker>
<l>If abject lawyers, and a venal jury,</l>
<l><pb n="276" facs="286"/>Should violate the sanctity of justice</l>
<l>By Russel's condemnation, still his merits</l>
<l>Are grav'd so deeply on the Nation's breast,</l>
<l>He stands so firm the idol of her love,</l>
<l>Oppression's self will fear to execute</l>
<l>The sentence of the prostituted law</l>
<l>Against a life so priz'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Alas! my friend,</l>
<l>When did a tyrant, like vindictive York,</l>
<l>(For 'tis the Duke who thirsts for Russel's blood)</l>
<l>When did a spirit of that sullen temper,</l>
<l>Impell'd by rancorous hate, by bigot rage,</l>
<l>And abject terror, when did such a spirit</l>
<l>Respect the virtue, Nature made its foe,</l>
<l>And treacherous Fortune gave it power to crush?</l>
<l>But tell me of the scene from whence you come!</l>
<l>Say! what has been alledg'd against my son?</l>
<l>I have been told the fierce and subtle Jefferies,</l>
<l>The Duke's base agent in this bloody business,</l>
<l>Relies upon the evidence of Howard,</l>
<l>As the sure instrument of Russel's death:</l>
<l><pb n="277" facs="287"/>Unprincipled he is, and prone to utter</l>
<l>What interest and fear may bid him swear.</l>
<l>What has he said? or is he yet unsummon'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPENCER.</speaker>
<l>Before I left your son, the faithless Howard</l>
<l>Began his artful tale; but soon he falter'd,</l>
<l>With feign'd affliction of a dread event,</l>
<l>Which suddenly was rumour'd through the court,</l>
<l>And struck the throng'd assembly with such wonder,</l>
<l>Malice stood mute, and Persecution paus'd.</l>
<l>Fresh from the Tower the tidings came, that Essex,</l>
<l>From terrors of that bar, where Russel stood,</l>
<l>Had with rash violence rush'd out of life,</l>
<l>And stain'd his desperate hands in his own blood.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>It cannot be! the firm, the gallant Essex</l>
<l>Could never end his being so ignobly;</l>
<l>And in the moment, when his generous soul</l>
<l>Felt only for his friend; his Russel's life</l>
<l>Yet wavering in the balance.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPENCER.</speaker>
<l>Such, my lord,</l>
<l><pb n="278" facs="288"/>Such is the comment of all honest hearts</l>
<l>On this dark story.—Heaven reveal the murder,</l>
<l>And punish it, though in th' assassin's veins</l>
<l>The tainted stream of royal blood may flow!—</l>
<l>Soon as the rumour reach'd your son, he bade me</l>
<l>Attempt to penetrate this dark transaction,</l>
<l>And bring you the result of all I heard;</l>
<l>Adding, that in the instant of his doom,</l>
<l>He would dispatch to you the noble Cavendish</l>
<l>With tidings of his sentence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Ah! my friend,</l>
<l>The fatal word, that ends his blessed life,</l>
<l>Has rung already in my tortur'd ear;</l>
<l>For I have seen the venal band suborn'd</l>
<l>To purchase, by the sacrifice of truth,</l>
<l>The blood of her mild champion. There's his guilt,</l>
<l>'Tis that his pure and patriotic zeal,</l>
<l>Guiding the voice of an enlighten'd senate,</l>
<l>Has labor'd to preserve the throne of England</l>
<l>From that blood-thirsty bigot, at whose feet</l>
<l>Her laws now lie, in hasty prostitution,</l>
<l><pb n="279" facs="289"/>Slaves to a tyrant yet uncrown'd; converted</l>
<l>From sacred guards of slander'd innocence,</l>
<l>Into base engines of vindictive murder.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Alas! my father, thou hast judg'd too well:</l>
<l>Thy dreadful presage is too soon confirm'd:</l>
<l>Behold the zealous Cavendish! he comes</l>
<l>With no quick step of joyous exultation;</l>
<l>But in his agitated gesture shews</l>
<l>A settled sorrow, and a fierce despair.</l>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> CAVENDISH.</stage>
<l>I come, my lord, the wretched messenger</l>
<l>Of that accurst event, which my weak judgment,</l>
<l>Not reaching the extent of human baseness,</l>
<l>Had hastily pronounc'd beyond the line</l>
<l>Of possible injustice. All the crimes,</l>
<l>That coward Tyranny can wish committed,</l>
<l>Shall now have credit.—Russel is condemn'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>O mockery of justice!—Righteous Heaven!</l>
<l>Yet interpose to save him!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="280" facs="290"/>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>My kind friend,</l>
<l>Thou but relatest what a father's eye</l>
<l>Foresaw too clearly, when I view'd the jury,</l>
<l>So justly challeng'd by my innocent son,</l>
<l>Marshall'd without the warrantry of law</l>
<l>To ensnare his life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAVENDISH.</speaker>
<l>Eternal infamy</l>
<l>Fall on the base assassins! chiefly fall</l>
<l>On those superior ministers of evil,</l>
<l>The treacherous guardians of our trampled laws,</l>
<l>Who in the robes of Heaven's high delegates</l>
<l>Perform the work of hell! from prostrate Justice</l>
<l>Wrest her pure sword, to stain it with the blood</l>
<l>Of her most faithful votary!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY MARGARET.</speaker>
<l>Yet try,</l>
<l>Try, my dear father, ere it prove too late,</l>
<l>By urgent intercessions to preserve him!</l>
<l>Your friends are many, and, howe'er inslam'd</l>
<l>By the vile arts of sanguinary York,</l>
<l><pb n="281" facs="291"/>The king has still a tenderness of heart,</l>
<l>That may incline to spare my gentle brother.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Alas! my daughter, cherish not too much</l>
<l>A hope, whose cruel failure will impart</l>
<l>New poignancy to thy too keen affliction!</l>
<l>All the mild virtues, which to thy pure sense</l>
<l>Plead for thy brother's safety, in the ear</l>
<l>Of envious Hate and terrified Oppression</l>
<l>Cry loudly for his death.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAVENDISH.</speaker>
<l>He shall not die.</l>
<l>What! though the blood-hound Jefferies has fasten'd</l>
<l>His fangs upon him! though the barbarous judges</l>
<l>Would make the temple of insulted Law</l>
<l>The slaughter-house of Tyranny!—there yet</l>
<l>Are means to turn the sharpen'd axe aside,</l>
<l>And shield the life of their devoted victim.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>What would thy dauntless zeal?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAVENDISH.</speaker>
<l>Your gentle son</l>
<l><pb n="282" facs="292"/>Has such just credit with this injur'd nation,</l>
<l>For public virtue, and designs exempt</l>
<l>From every selfish bias of the soul,</l>
<l>Thousands would throw into extremest hazard</l>
<l>Their fortunes, and their being to preserve</l>
<l>The dying martyr of defenceless freedom.</l>
<l>I hold it easy, in the very hour</l>
<l>Oppression means to triumph in his blood,</l>
<l>With some selected horsemen to o'erpower</l>
<l>The slaves who guard him, ere they reach the scaffold,</l>
<l>And bear him swiftly to a safe retreat.</l>
<l>Applauding millions will assist his rescue,</l>
<l>And bless the efforts of his brave deliverers!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>No! Cavendish! by friendship's holy ties,</l>
<l>That prompt thy generous purpose, I conjure thee</l>
<l>To think of it no farther.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAVENDISH.</speaker>
<l>What! my Lord,</l>
<l>Shall we look tamely on, and by connivance</l>
<l>Be made a party in this legal murder?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="283" facs="293"/>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Dear ardent friend! there are disastrous times,</l>
<l>And this is one of them, when all the functions</l>
<l>True courage is allow'd to exercise,</l>
<l>Are resignation and a brave endurance.</l>
<l>My word is given to thy kind thoughtful friend,</l>
<l>To check all desperate sallies of affliction,</l>
<l>All, that the fond intemperance of love</l>
<l>Could hazard for his safety.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAVENDISH.</speaker>
<l>Generous Russel!</l>
<l>By Heaven 'tis happier far to share thy death,</l>
<l>Than live, to see our wretched country robb'd</l>
<l>Of all her hopes in thy unequall'd virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>To me much happier!—to a father's heart</l>
<l>It would be consolation and delight</l>
<l>To perish with his child; but there are duties</l>
<l>More painful to sustain than the short struggle</l>
<l>That ends our mortal being:—and to us</l>
<l>These duties now belong—let us remember</l>
<l>The trust that he bequeaths!—his wife! his children!</l>
<l><pb n="284" facs="294"/>'Tis ours to live for them. Remember too</l>
<l>His noble answer to the princely Monmouth,</l>
<l>Offering to share his Prison and his fate!</l>
<l>Did he not say, it would embitter death</l>
<l>To have his friends die with him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAVENDISH.</speaker>
<l>O my Lord!</l>
<l>Your sorrow is of pure and heavenly temper;</l>
<l>Mine the fierce anguish of indignant frenzy:</l>
<l>Pray pardon it!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Pardon thee! gallant spirit!</l>
<l>Thou bright example of exalted friendship!</l>
<l>Thou hast my love, my fondest admiration;</l>
<l>In my just heart thou rankest with my children,</l>
<l>And art the pillar, now my Russell falls,</l>
<l>That my weak age must cling to for support.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAVENDISH.</speaker>
<l>In duty, my dear Lord, though not in merit,</l>
<l>You may account me your's: and pitying Heaven</l>
<l>May yet, in mercy to a nation's prayers,</l>
<l>Spare to your virtuous age your worthier son:</l>
<l><pb n="285" facs="295"/>I cannot bend my spirit to admit</l>
<l>His fate inevitable: gracious Powers!</l>
<l>Who watch o'er suffering virtue, who inspire</l>
<l>The prosperous deeds of chance-defying friendship,</l>
<l>Assist my lab'ring and distracted brain,</l>
<l>Whose faculties are on the rack to find</l>
<l>Expedients to preserve our country's pride,</l>
<l>The friend and champion of her faith and freedom,</l>
<l>From the base stroke of tyrannous revenge!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEDFORD.</speaker>
<l>Vain are those anxious thoughts: the vigilant eye</l>
<l>Of keen Oppression will secure her victim.</l>
<l>The nerveless arm of childhood could as soon</l>
<l>Wrest from the tiger's gripe his bleeding prey,</l>
<l>As we by violence deliver Russel</l>
<l>From the vindictive York.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAVENDISH</speaker>
<stage>(after a pause).</stage>
<l>I thank thee, Heaven!</l>

<l>Your pardon, my dear lord!—accept alone</l>

<l>Thou pray'st in vain, dear child!—this dauntless friend,</l>
<l>Transcendent as he is in truth and honour,</l>
<l>Can nought avail us: he must prove the dupe</l>
<l>Of ardent passions and of sanguine virtue.</l>
<l>If there's a ray of glimmering hope, that yet</l>
<l>May faintly lead us through this night of horror,</l>
<l>It cannot rise from any bright endowments</l>
<l>In those we love, but rather from the vice,</l>
<l>The abject vice, that glares in our oppressors.</l>
<l>Our tyrants are necessitous, and thirst</l>
<l>For gold, as keenly as for innocent blood.</l>
<l>Kind fortune, haply for this great emergence,</l>
<l>Has made me master of no common wealth;</l>
<l>And this, with lucky art distributed</l>
<l>Among the needy minions of the king,</l>
<l>May purchase still our Russel's forfeit life.—</l>
<l>Come! my dear child, retire we to consult</l>
<l>On this our sole resource! Thou will not scruple</l>
<l>To meet, and to embrace a noble poverty,</l>
<l>If thy lost portion can redeem thy brother!</l>

<speaker>LADY RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>MUST I intreat in vain?—Alas! my Russel,</l>
<l>Where is thy sweet compliancy of soul,</l>
<l>That made, till now, thy Rachel's voice a stranger</l>
<l>To rude and irk some importunity?</l>
<l><pb n="289" facs="299"/>Has life so little to engage thy wishes</l>
<l>Thou wilt not ask to live?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Canst thou, my love,</l>
<l>By so unkind a question canst thou give</l>
<l>Such hard construction to thy Russel's thoughts?</l>
<l>Where is there one inhabitant of earth,</l>
<l>If not thy husband, who has every cause</l>
<l>To cherish his existence?—Gracious Power!</l>
<l>Whose wisdom regulates the lot of mortals,</l>
<l>I feel, and with devoutest gratitude</l>
<l>Bless thee for signal bounties to thy servant,</l>
<l>But most for this, thy best and dearest gift,</l>
<l>This lovely virtuous woman; whom to part with</l>
<l>Is now my hardest trial: but from thee,</l>
<l>Dread Arbiter of every human scene!</l>
<l>(However strange to man's contracted sense)</l>
<l>This trial comes; O strengthen us to bear it</l>
<l>With tender fortitude and meek obedience!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>It is our duty still, and Heaven enjoins it,</l>
<l>To make all blameless efforts to preserve</l>
<l><pb n="290" facs="300"/>A life so precious: if thy rigid honor,</l>
<l>In pity both to me and to thy children,</l>

<l>Thy instant pardon from the pliant king.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Thou knowest not th' inexorable hate</l>
<l>Of that blood-thirsty spirit.—It has pleas'd</l>
<l>The author of my life to let the rage</l>
<l>Of ruthless bigotry prevail against it:</l>
<l>A band of venal or misguided men</l>
<l>Have doom'd me to the scaffold, on the plea</l>
<l>That I have plotted to destroy my sovereign,</l>
<l>Though Heaven and thou, who knowest all my soul,</l>
<l>See the base falshood of the bloody charge:</l>
<l>But to the voice of Law, however tortur'd,</l>
<l>I owe a prompt obedience; nought remains</l>
<l>But that I meet the stroke of stern Oppression</l>
<l>As suits the votary of Public Virtue.</l>
<l>I must not sully, by a base submission,</l>
<l>A name yet spotless, the sole legacy</l>
<l>It is allow'd me to bequeath my children.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="291" facs="301"/>
<speaker>LADY RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Dear as I hold thy life, which is in truth</l>
<l>My only anchor in this sea of troubles,</l>
<l>Believe me, Russel, I would rather yield,</l>
<l>Without a struggle yield that precious life</l>
<l>To Persecution's stroke, rather than lead,</l>
<l>If aught could lead, thy clear and resolute virtue</l>
<l>To one base act of weakness and dishonour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Alas! my love, the cloud of thy affliction</l>
<l>Has dimm'd thy quick discernment; but the paper,</l>
<l>Which thy fond care now urges me to write,</l>
<l>Would darken all the story of my life:</l>
<l>I must not, in that story's closing leaf,</l>
<l>Where Fortitude should fix the seal of Honor,</l>
<l>Mar the fair record with a fearful blot.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Dear Russel! exercise thy purer judgment;</l>
<l>These are not scruples of thy manly reason,</l>
<l>But niceties of proud fantastic honor,</l>
<l>Of honor jealous to a vain excess.</l>
<l>How can the measure, that my love solicits,</l>
<l><pb n="292" facs="302"/>Involve thee in disgrace? Without abasement,</l>
<l>Can injur'd Innocence not say to Power,</l>
<l>Give me the life, of which Iniquity</l>
<l>Has made thy voice the arbiter?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Thou knowest,</l>
<l>Dear inmate of my secret soul! kind prompter</l>
<l>Of my best thoughts! it has been long the aim</l>
<l>Of my past life to win my country's love;</l>
<l>Not by the popular arts of vain ambition,</l>
<l>(Which Nature never form'd me to possess)</l>
<l>But by incessant vigilance to shield</l>
<l>Our faith and freedom, by an ardent wish</l>
<l>To prove that patriot virtue, (the stale jest</l>
<l>Of servile spirits, as an empty name)</l>
<l>Is an existing vigorous principle</l>
<l>In minds of English temper. I have fail'd</l>
<l>In the prime object that my soul pursued,</l>
<l>To save our pure religion and our laws</l>
<l>From Bigotry's encroachment; and I lose</l>
<l>My life, endanger'd by that noble conflict:</l>
<l>But I have gain'd, and let me still preserve it!</l>
<l><pb n="293" facs="303"/>The kind esteem of this enlighten'd nation:</l>
<l>This I must forfeit, forfeit all the praise</l>
<l>And influence of no inglorious life,</l>
<l>If I become an abject suppliant</l>
<l>To that fierce zealot, from whose iron rod</l>
<l>I strove to shelter this devoted land.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>No, Russel; the corrupted lips of Faction</l>
<l>Are prone to evil: but the voice of ages,</l>
<l>The sentence of the world, is firmly just;</l>
<l>And by that sentence thou art sure to stand</l>
<l>High on the list of those bright characters</l>
<l>Immortaliz'd with pure idolatry</l>
<l>By Truth and Freedom; men whose very name</l>
<l>Is sweetest music to the ear of Nature.</l>
<l>If in a future age, when we are dust,</l>
<l>Thy virtues can be question'd, it must be</l>
<l>By sycophants, who, flattering royalty,</l>
<l>With slanderous surmises would degrade</l>
<l>Each just antagonist of lawless power;</l>
<l>Or by those yet more abject enemies,</l>
<l>Those sceptics of a cold sarcastic spirit,</l>
<l><pb n="294" facs="304"/>Who, judging from their own contracted hearts,</l>
<l>Possess no confidence in human virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Affection over-rates thy Russel's merit:</l>
<l>But let this fond opinion of his fame</l>
<l>Preclude thy vain request, which, being granted,</l>
<l>Would but afflict thy love. Consider well</l>
<l>How it would wound thy generous pride, to hear</l>
<l>Thy lord had stain'd the life thou deem'st so glorious</l>
<l>By an ignoble eagerness to live.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, Russel, it would wound me more</l>
<l>To think that, deaf to all my just entreaties,</l>
<l>My husband, careless of his orphan children,</l>
<l>With sullen dignity threw life away,</l>
<l>Rather than stoop to sue for the remission</l>
<l>Of his unrighteous doom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Alas! my love,</l>
<l>Should I implicitly pursue the dictates</l>
<l>Of all thy fond solicitude, such conduct</l>
<l><pb n="295" facs="305"/>Would but provoke the insult of our foes,</l>
<l>And could avail thee nothing.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Yes, my Russel,</l>
<l>Should the relentless York reject thy prayer,</l>
<l>In those sad years of bitterness and anguish,</l>
<l>When, if the will of Heaven is fix'd to part us,</l>
<l>My widow'd soul, with unabating sorrow,</l>
<l>Must dwell upon thy image, and for ever</l>
<l>Repass in thought these agonizing scenes,</l>
<l>It will afford me then a faint relief,</l>
<l>To think my active love, in this distress,</l>
<l>Omitted nothing, that had duty's sanction,</l>
<l>To snatch thee from the scaffold.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Lovely suppliant!</l>
<l>Thy virtuous tenderness has melted me;</l>
<l>And, though I could not purchase it by guilt,</l>
<l>Thy peace is dearer to my heart than glory.</l>
<l>Thou shalt not say thy Russel e'er refus'd</l>
<l>One prayer of thine:—give me again the pen</l>
<l>My weak disdain rejected.

<l>Which makes thee frequent in thy welcome visits</l>
<l>To a poor captive.—There, my anxious Love!</l>
<l>Take what thy truth and tenderness have forc'd</l>
<l>From Russel's frail and yielding resolution:</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPENCER.</speaker>
<l>The touching eloquence of her affliction,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Impossible, my friend!</l>

<l>Yet think, my Lord, that other means of safety—</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>No, Spencer: I have thought, I trust not vainly,</l>
<l>Of the chief object that my mind must dwell on,</l>
<l>How to sustain the trying part to which</l>
<l>The will of Heaven appoints me; how to meet</l>
<l>The sudden stroke of ignominious death,</l>
<l>As may become the man whose life has won</l>
<l>From this brave land observance and regard.—</l>
<l>O Spencer! when the wearied eye surveys</l>
<l>The gloomy face of Earth, the Law's abuse,</l>
<l>And Freedom sinking under savage Power,</l>
<l>The wreck of Public Virtue, the base arts</l>
<l>And treachery of her apostate sons,</l>
<l><pb n="300" facs="310"/>With all the countless ills that in her train</l>
<l>A blind and barbarous Superstition brings;</l>
<l>When these are present to the guiltless mind,</l>

<l>Of social duties and domestic bliss.</l>
<l>I will avow to thee, (for thy mild spirit</l>
<l>Can sympathize in every true distress)</l>
<l>That when I think to what excess of anguish</l>
<l>I leave the worthiest and most tender wife,</l>
<l>That with endearing innocence and love</l>
<l>E'er blest a husband, the forbidden tear</l>
<l>Starts from my eye perforce, my frame is chill'd,</l>
<l><pb n="301" facs="311"/>And shudders at the sharp divorce of steel,</l>
<l>So soon to fall upon our chaste affection.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPENCER.</speaker>
<l>Yet may ye live a blessing to each other;</l>
<l>And give a bright example to mankind,</l>
<l>That happiness abides with virtuous love!—</l>
<l>Life stands within your choice:—the King, who knows</l>
<l>With what a fond respect and confidence</l>
<l>The generous people lean to the opinion</l>
<l>Of men so rooted in their hearts as you are,</l>
<l>Courts your acceptance of immediate pardon;</l>
<l>If you will but acknowledge, in his presence,</l>
<l>That you believe no subject has a right,</l>
<l>However tempted, to resist the Throne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Have any of my friends suppos'd, that Russel</l>
<l>Could buy existence at a price like this?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPENCER.</speaker>
<l>The worthy churchmen, who in this vile prison</l>
<l>Have been your kind assiduous attendants,</l>
<l>Build on this ground strong hopes;—they have obtain'd</l>
<l>The sanction of your venerable father</l>
<l><pb n="302" facs="312"/>To argue with you this important question;</l>
<l>Believing they may lead your candid mind</l>

<l>Have the clear warrantry of truth and reason.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Good men! they are an honor to the church</l>
<l>For signal harmony of faith and practice;</l>
<l>But haply, cramp'd by piety's nice scruples,</l>
<l>Their minds have not expanded to embrace</l>
<l>The mighty cause of Freedom.—O my friend!</l>
<l>I want the spirit-stirring faculty</l>
<l>Of eloquence, to range in bright array</l>
<l>The potent claims of Nature, and enlist</l>
<l>In her pure service all the noble passions</l>
<l>That give distinction to the life of man:</l>
<l>But gracious Heaven endow'd me with a heart</l>
<l>To act the upright virtuous citizen;</l>
<l>And meet the axe, much rather than betray</l>
<l>The charter'd rights of this my native land.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Are you, my Lord, so settled in your thoughts</l>
<l><pb n="303" facs="313"/>On this nice question, that no arguments</l>
<l>May shake the airy fabric of opinion?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Good Spencer, thou hast known me many years,</l>
<l>And for a man of plain and simple reason;</l>
<l>Which clearly tells me that the King's position,</l>
<l>Once granted, sinks the free-born sons of England</l>
<l>To the tame vassals of a Turkish despot.</l>
<l>My mind can frame no image of a state</l>
<l>That laws have limited, without a right</l>
<l>To guard those limitations; and my conscience,</l>
<l>That higher sovereign, who challenges</l>
<l>My first obedience in all points of moment,</l>
<l>Will not permit me, by a different language,</l>
<l>To purchase life from the deluded King.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SPENCER.</speaker>
<l>With painful admiration I have heard</l>
<l>The steady dictates of your patriot virtue,</l>
<l>That will, with mingled agony and joy,</l>
<l>Confirm the presage of your noble father.</l>
<l>Howe'er he listens, with attentive fondness,</l>
<l>To all that friendly zeal suggests to save you,</l>
<l><pb n="304" facs="314"/>He knows, and glories in your firm adherence</l>
<l>To the dear rights of England; nor can wish,</l>
<l>Though with the sanction of such friends, to see you</l>
<l>Exchange it for the lure of forfeit life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUSSEL.</speaker>
<l>Although I trust he fully knows that mind,</l>
<l>Which his fond cares have strengthen'd and enrich'd</l>
<l>With its best powers of manly resolution;</l>
<l>Yet, as ill-grounded and distressing doubts</l>
<l>Are natural infirmities of age,</l>
<l>At times, perchance, my venerable father</l>
<l>May fear lest the approach of violent death</l>
<l>Should with disgraceful pliancy infect</l>
<l>The spirit of his son—I therefore pray thee</l>
<l>Return; assure him, that our pious friends</l>
<l>Must lose their well-meant labor in debate:</l>
<l>My mind's unchangeable; and gracious Heaven,</l>
<l>As my dark fate draws nearer, gives my soul</l>
<l>New strength to triumph o'er its shadowy terrors!</l>
<l>Assure the tender Bedford, I shall meet</l>
<l>The hour of execution as his love</l>

<l><pb n="305" facs="315"/>Which suits the guiltless son of such a father.</l>
