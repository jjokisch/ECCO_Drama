<head>DEDICATION.</head>
<head>TO THE REV. — BALL, OF WINFRITH, NEAR WEYMOUTH.</head>
<opener><salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>WHEN I rambled into Dorsetshire in the summer of 1791, my only introduction to your acquaintance was your own frank affability, and my sole recommendation to your hospitable roof, that I was a stranger. By your good-natured politeness, my mind was cheered in the solitudes of Lulworth, and by your many friendly and kind offices I was furnished with information in a place where all was novelty,
<pb facs="4"/>though my first charm there was the certainty of what I had supposed to be common in England, a pious and benevolent clergyman; and though I could, previous to my visits at Winfrith, boast the honour of having stood before the great gates of a bishop's palace; yet, for the comforts I there enjoyed in the little parlour of a country parsonage-house, accept this trifling testimony of well-remembered goodness to,</p>
<closer><salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
<signed>Your highly honoured, and much obliged servant, J. O'KEEFFE.</signed>

<sp>
<lg>
<l>DREAD censors! by whose nod we sink or rise!</l>
<l>Be merry, pray, to-night, and not too wise!</l>
<l>Our bard will smile at the strict critic rule,</l>
<l>He had his learning in a laughing—school.</l>
<l>Order, and ancient laws, he dares neglect;</l>
<l>And rather would be pleasant, than correct;</l>
<l>Nay, spite of all grave classical communities,</l>
<l>Wou'd sooner make you laugh than keep the unities.</l>
<l>Mirth is his aim—and critics! we implore you,</l>
<l>Relax, while our light scenes we lay before you!</l>
<l>Good-humour to the countenance adds graces,</l>
<l>Unbend the iron muscles of your faces!</l>
<l>Lay acid wisdom by; think mirth no sin;</l>
<l>Throw your sour dignity aside,—and grin!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet tho' we laugh we won'd not quit the grounds</l>
<l>Where sportive nature marks her ample bounds:</l>
<l>Various her range! calm, gay, then in the vapours—</l>
<l><hi>We</hi> catch the goddess while she's cutting capers.</l>
<l>To prove that we have caught her in the act,</l>
<l>Our Hermitage is built upon <hi>a fact.</hi></l>
<l>If, then, the drama's frolic pencil draws</l>
<l>A frolic fact—away with critic laws!</l>
<l>And grant the sketcher's fancy your applause!</l>
<l>Oft has he drawn before—this shop is full</l>
<l>With touches from his hand; and none thought dull;</l>
<l>Should this, to-night, seem vapid to your eyes,</l>
<l>'Twould prove a <hi>Dis</hi>-Agreeable Surprize—</l>
<l>Oh! think on his collection now in store,</l>
<l>And smile on him, on whom you smil'd before!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>BARLEYCORN.</speaker>
<p>TOBY, Toby Thatch! what dost stand gaping about there?</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> TOBY.</stage>
<p>Been up hill to look towards great road.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BARLEYCORN.</speaker>
<p>Any carriages coming?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TOBY.</speaker>
<p>Fine coach and four horses—a high thing—O me! chay—a pheaton (I think they call it)—and a whiskey-me-gig.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
<speaker>BARLEYCORN.</speaker>
<p>And there's a boat full of company just put in at the cove, all to see 'Squire Whimmy's improvements—Then there's our poney-race. Dang my buttons, we shall have a house full to-day. What a donkey was I to let that daughter of mine go gadding to Blandford. Company flocking,—and my child, that ought to have my interest at heart, when she shou'd be preparing entertainment for the guests, mayhap, she's now gawking over a race-course.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TOBY.</speaker>
<p>And all the business left upon I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BARLEYCORN.</speaker>
<p>Always grumbling, you idle rascal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TOBY.</speaker>
<p>Well, I've more trades than the best idle rascal in all England. I'm waiter and attend the company, as ostler I wait on horses; I paints the names on the smugglers' boats; I plays the fiddle at church; I'm a tight locksmith; I'm a bit'n a parish constable; and for walking on messages to Weymouth, Blandford, Corfe, Poole, or Wareham, I'm allow'd to be as smart a footpad as any in the county of Dorset. <stage>[Laughing without.]</stage> There's the 'Squire's sarvants within, ha! ha! ha!—they've rare stingo at home, and yet come drinking our taplash. I'll go sarve 'em. <stage>(Going.)</stage>—but there's their master come upon 'em;—he's in a mortish fury with som'at.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BARLEYCORN.</speaker>
<p>Dang my buttons! This daughter of mine not come yet, and here the house now chuck full.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
<speaker>TOBY.</speaker>
<p>I'll run and see; for I warrants Kitty will bring home some fine ballads.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BARLEYCORN.</speaker>
<p>Our subscription' not full to buy the silver cup; and the folks are already gaping for the race. Take you the paper about and ax what the company will give towards it.</p>

<p>I wool.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> WHIMMY, <hi>(in a rage.)</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>You, sirrah! did I not build this inn here for you at the very entrance of my improvements? Did not I put you and your family into it, and an't you getting money here as if you coin'd it? Is it not a bean-garden that I've turn'd you into; and an't you fattening in it, like a base ungrateful great boar as you are?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BARLEYCORN.</speaker>
<p>Great boar! I don't understand what your honour would be at.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Here, on the very day I have propriated to oblige the world of taste and fashion, by showing them my house, pictures, gardens, and improvements, you must fix your damn'd twopenny poney-race.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BARLEYCORN.</speaker>
<p>I did it to draw company to the village.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Yes, to your own paltry alehouse, you sordid rascal!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BARLEYCORN.</speaker>
<p>Improvements!—Who'd come to view your improvements, Sir, if they wa'n't sure of a good dinner from me? If they can eat marvel and drink water, they may feast upon your improvements; but after all their eye-gluttony in your gardens, their palates are ready enough for a Scotch-collop at the Red Lion. Here, you Toby, why don't you mind the company. <stage>(Calling off.)</stage> Dang my buttons!—Landlord—Big boar—Pay his rent.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit muttering.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Here's plebeian gratitude!—Oh! plague of the fingers that sign'd you a seven years lease.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS</speaker>
<stage>without.</stage>
<p>No, no,—I'll walk up to Whimmy's—Oh! why he's here—How d'ye do, Dick?—Found you out, eh!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>My name is Richard.—What! the friend of my youth, Billy Pranks.— <stage>(Aside.)</stage> Now shall I be twitted with former favours; and I don't like that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>So, you've pick'd up the mocusses in the Indies! Pack'd up, came over.—Never look'd after me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>I ask'd every body after you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>What! I suppose you ask'd King Charles at Charing-Cross;—Nobody about 'Change could tell of William Pranks, the banker, of Lombard-street.—You hound, I was your friend when you hadn't another; but now you don't want one—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Hound, what's the matter with you? Wou'd you have me advertise or send the bellman about to cry you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>You're most plaguily alter'd for the worse. Well, I've been told all about you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Then, as you have heard l've hopes of a peerage, you might be a little more respectful, Billy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>If you want to have more respect than another man, be better than another man; for your being call'd a lord, can neither give you a wise head or a good heart. How's your daughter? fine girl, I hear; wonder'd at it, when I thought of your phiz.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>You are as civil as ever.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>You shall give her to my nephew, the greatest rogue in England.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Why there may be finer girls than my daughter, yet I think she's too good for a rogue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Where did you make your fortune?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>You know in the Indies to be sure. <stage>(Aside.)</stage> If I had millions this fellow still overawes me, that I'm a mere mouse before him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>I scorn to remind you;—you owe all that fortune to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY, </speaker>
<stage>(aside.)</stage>
<p>'Twill be long enough before I repay you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Only think of all the good things I've done for you. Didn't I suffer you to write for me from six in the morning to seven at night; lock'd you up, and fed you upon bread and cheese, to sharpen your industry upon the grindstone of necessity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Yes; you did keep my nose to the grindstone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Wasn't it I got you out to Bombay in a respectable line of a guinea-pig? Didn't I procure the letters to the Governor and general officers? Didn't I write myself, "This young man, the bearer, is a "prudent lad, that will do all you dirty work?"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, your letter did me great honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Didn't you derive all your interest from a pamphlet
<pb n="7" facs="13"/>that I wrote, and gave you the credit of, tho' I thought 'twou'd bring the author to the pillory?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>I acknowledge all your goodness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Then give your daughter to my nephew; they shall have every penny I'm worth when I die.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Aye; but there's danger of your living a great while, Billy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>What! are you afraid of it, you golden calf?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Where is your nephew?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Was in the Temple; is now in the King's Bench; he doesn't know it, but it's I that keep him there, to make him, from a dread of confinement, avoid running in debt. Shan't give him two sixpences unless he marries your daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Aye; but I've promis'd her to a good young man in the neighbourhood here, who has made the tour of Europe. Ah! Mr. Peregrine brought home taste enough to lay out my gardens, dispose my statues, and make yon spot the seat of virtù and elegance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS, </speaker>
<stage>(aside.)</stage>
<p>Got his money like a knave, and now gives it away like a fool.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Not half an hour since I actually promis'd Mr. Peregrine that he shou'd marry her to-morrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>But, don't you recollect a prior promise to me? Didn't you engage if you ever made a fortune and had a child, my next a-kin shou'd have both?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Aye; but Peregrine will shoot me if I break my word to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Break it with me, and I'll cut your wizen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear! I'm brought into this dilemma by my bad memory. Hark ye, Billy, I'll make Peregrine wait, on pretext that his constancy must be tried.—Yes, I'll send him to travel again for a seven years.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Instead of marriage, let him go to-morrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Aye; but on his return he'll claim my promise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw!—his back turn'd, my nephew will be here;—I've already sent for him; Tom's a sprightly blade, monstrous wicked tho'.—This the entrance to your grounds?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I've transported Italy into England.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="15"/>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Italy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Here you'll see gardens.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>I've a garden at Brixton Causeway.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Such bananas—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>What! do they boil better with a bit of corn'd beef than a summer cabbage?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Cabbage! My hot-house!—half a dozen such peaches last Christmas! upon a sum up, the rearing will cost me two guineas a piece.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>For whose eating?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>My own, to be sure.</p>

<p>Old Nick jump after them; swallow in a minute what would have kept a whole family for a twelvemonth.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Wer'n't they my own?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Superfluities are not our own, whilst the poor want common necessaries. When do you dine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="16"/>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Not till to-morrow, because I resign my house and improvements to-day to the admiration of a wondering public; but you shall sup with me, my friend.</p>

<p>What! my worthy Cambridge Johnian, George Peregrine? ah! how d'ye do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>Ah! but Tom, what has brought you here? what are you on?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>I'm on air, fire—Are you on a visit down here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>Visit! no, at home; I've a sort of little lodge hard by, at which I shall be very happy to see you; but, come, what brought you down here? To see Mr. Whimmy's gardens!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="22"/>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Whimmy! who's he? You can't conceive what a variety of high—low—jack—and game, since the morning we parted at the Shakespeare, you in a post-chaise for Dover. I in a phaeton for New-market, just run a horse at Blandford—lost—best of the fun, I'm at this moment a prisoner in the King's Bench.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>A prisoner in the King's Bench, and 122 miles from town? Why, Tom, you've skipp'd out of bounds indeed! Come, how?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Why you may suppose, George, that my expences far exceeded my uncle's allowance—thought to help out by a lucky hit now and then, so bought a blood mare, had her put in training, then entered for the plate at Blandford—a beautiful thing—the crack of the caurse—but before the meeting, a few positive mechanical rascals thrust me into the King's Bench—must go to Blandford though, so procured the rules, and in hopes the turf could bring me in money enough to pay my debts, off I spank'd for Dorsetshire, and, spite of informers, appeared on the course. The opinion seemed all in favour of my mare; but, like a cursed green horn, I withdrew her from the plate, and made a by-match to run her against Lord Skelter's sour-crout, to ride ourselves—but after the first round, my infernal groom told me I carried too much weight, slung part away, came in first; but my Lord insisting on our being again weighed, I was too light by a pound and an half, so that though I won, I lost the race; two hundred to my Lord; in short, every guinea of a full
<pb n="17" facs="23"/>five hundred that an honest methodist preacher, my landlord in the rules, raised to equip me for the expedition.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Tom! I thought when you and I were at Cambridge together, your scampers to Newmarket would turn to this at last.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Certainly it's life, my boy.—You were always a dead fag, and I was a blood. You know I never could prevail on you, even then, to make one of our toxophilite club.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>But where are you going now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Can you tell me? Dem'me if I can tell <hi>you.</hi>—Sir, I was distressed—distracted—I—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>Ay! but Tom, your mare,—as she won—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>She's gone; sold her for five hundred—went to dinner, tuck'd three bottles under my girdle—hopp'd off as steady as old time to the assembly, laugh'd at the minuets—tol lol, <stage>(mimicks)</stage> adjourned to a snug hazard party—lost every face—roll'd into the street at eight in the morning—saw a carriage at the Greyhound door—pretty girl all alone—finding it was a return chaise, stept in without knowing whither bound—had a most delectable chat—a lovely creature—single—hither we've come—she's there—I'm here—she's an angel with a great fortune—I'm a dog without the price of a collar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="18" facs="24"/>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! Well this is a most curious detail of your adventures. Tom you hav'n't heard, perhaps, I'm going to be married to the heiress of the Castle yonder?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! this is your muzzing for a fellowship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>But won't you return to the King's Bench?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>No! can't do that; they'd never let me out again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>Yes; but if you're found out here, it will be worse: what will you do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>What will I do? Damn it, you're always putting me to the mathematics: fling by your Euclid, and you tell me what I shall do.</p>
</sp>

<p>Ha! ha! ha! the very thing for you, Tom, ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p>Paper! what's this? <stage>(reads an advertisement which is posted up against the sign post.)</stage>A liberal offer.—A person wanted to sit dressed as a hermit in the hermitage
<pb n="19" facs="25"/>of very capital gardens: on condition of his attendance for seven years, he will be entitled to a gratuity of two thousand pounds, and three hundred a year for the remainder of his life.—For particulars inquire within.—Eh! what's all this about? Hermit!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>Tom, why suppose you apply for this.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Me! what I turn hermit?—Pooh, nonsense! a high go, faith.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>Will your uncle pay your debts?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>He! I've got a hint 'twas he threw me into prison.—No! never shall I touch an ounce of his.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>A couple of thousands—three hundred a year for life!</p>

<p>Oh! but how wou'd it tell among one's friends? mine are all bloods, my dear.</p>

<p>What else can I do? for when I came into this village, I didn't know which way to turn my face; back to London I cannot go; I'll have it—two thousand! three hundred a year! I'll have it. Tol, lol.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEREGRINE.</speaker>
<p>No, but stop—can I believe that you'd continue seven years?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Seven thousand! Be independent of uncle—dress'd up in a gown and long beard, dam'me, I'll be a fine old bald-headed buck—besides the change of person, if the marshal should send constables down here after me—the very thing!</p>

<p>But I suppose, as you knew where he went, you'll try to re-take him for the reward.</p>

<p>I'll do that thing. 'Twas to run a horse at Blandford races that made him run from his bail. Don't you know him?</p>

<p>No! when I send a man to quod, 'tis enough for me if my bailiff knows him. Lucky for you finding me here; I come down to Weymouth on business; as I shall charge my client three guineas a day for my travelling expences, I thought I might as well give my wife a little country air and a sea-dip—left her behind, ill at Weymouth, when I came upon this water excursion to see Mr. Whimmy's improvements.

<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>My hermit galloping round a fish-pond! Tully, to-morrow you may go with the other servants to Wool Fair, but to-day you must brush up all your eloquence for your post of Ciceroni to describe the attic urbanity of my English Tusculum here. But mind, Tully, I command you not to take a penny from one of the company.</p>

<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>No. Gentlemen suffering the public to pay their servants wages, and turning their own houses into a Sadlers Wells and a Royal Grove, is mean. I never paid for seeing pictures in palaces and grape vines in gardens, that I didn't blush for the disgrace thrown upon the dignity of the owner. Is the water party come that stopt at the Red Lion?</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. Mrs. Maggs is now showing them the house. Ah! she told them, that the picture of Mary Magdalen was Mrs. Molly Olmondle.</p>

<p>It's Mr. Whimmy's way not to allow the hermit any dinner on the day when the company's expected: but, ecod, you shan't fast while my father's house affords a dinner. <stage>(Aside.)</stage>—But, what did you come down here and turn hermit for?</p>

<p>I—I wish my father, with his other changes of humour, wou'd give up this fancy of resigning the house thus to strangers; people, one don't know who, every Wednesday here come stamping and staring about—even my dressing-room is not my own.</p>

<p>No, Sir, this is my father's house.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Merely for admission to you, my angel; I've hired as your father's hermit—dying for you ever since we parted—a fine creature—but demme, if I ever thought of you since. <stage>(Aside.)</stage></p>

<p>Eh! Peregrine's intended, distress'd! eh!—how? tell me—you may. Why, my dear Ma'am, I'm—you don't know, perhaps, that I'm your Peregrine's most intimate friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DIAN.</speaker>
<p>Was it, indeed, you I saw just now arm-in-arm with him?—Oh! then you don't know, perhaps, that my father, after giving his sanction to the addresses of a young gentleman in the neighbourhood, now suddenly changes his mind, and insists upon my marrying the nephew of some old friend of his.—Yonder's Peregrine, <stage>(looking out)</stage> he hasn't yet heard this unlucky news.</p>

<p>My friend, Peregrine's intended sposa; I had hopes, that if he got this lady and her fortune, he might tip me a thousand pounds, without a seven year's imprisonment in the old gentleman's hermitage; but borrowing money is throwing water upon the warm heart of friendship. <stage>(Laughing without.)</stage> 'Sdeath, the company!—I must now earn my annuity.—Heh! is that Kitty gliding through the bushes?—a most dear dangerous little Barleycorn this. Marriage is all out of sight, and, without it, to take all a simple young girl's innocence may bestow, would be, indeed, giving life in my breast to the worm that never dies.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>MRS. MAGGS.</speaker>
<p>This poor hermit mus'n't sit here, and have no dinner. My master has got so crusty with me of late, that I'm quite weary of looking after other people's concerns; and as our young lady's to be married tomorrow, this will be no place for me. If I cou'd get a man to my mind, I'd keep house for myself, and this handsome fellow is just to my liking.—Besides, my conceited son, Natty Maggs, is soon out of his time; he shall have a father to thrash him, when he gets saucy to me.</p>

Sir, I'm a gard'ner, and though I do dig, I'm not a spalpeen potatoe-boy—I've read big books of botamy, and the Millar's Dictionary and Cyclopaddy's. Didn't I graft a mayduke uppon a kackagay apple-tree then in my hot-house. Didn't my Lord (when he breakfasted with you) pull from the same tree a cannister of Hyson tea and a basket of Seville oranges? A'n't my flowers so sweet that the hives round the country are empty, and the swarms of

<p>Your modern gardens are art spoiling nature; fixing up a stone woman where one expects to find a rosy girl of health, flesh, and blood: if we must have statues, instead of importing ancient heathen gods into English meadow, why not encourage British arts to celebrate British heroes? for a Jupiter by Phidias give me an Elliot by a Bacon: the five thousand pounds you laid out upon that clumsy Pantheon yonder, wou'd have built a neat cluster of alms-houses, where age and infancy might find an asylum from the pangs of indigence.</p>

<p>Oh! the devil! am I really the character I only personated. <stage>(Aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Where is he?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Can't you see? thrash him for his impudence to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Why, ah, Tom!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Aye, poor Tom! <stage>(Snivelling.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>By the Lord, it's my galloping hermit! <stage>(surpris'd)</stage> and your nephew.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS. </speaker>
<stage>(To Old Pranks.)</stage>
<p>Sir, I now see your goodness; but had I even before known it, I cou'd not have enjoy'd the blessing you design'd for me, at the expence of a friend's happiness. Mr. Peregrine has love and merit.—I admire, but don't deserve the lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Then, since you're so disinterested as to decline the golden pippin, I'll give you a sweet wild strawberry.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> KITTY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>KITTY.</speaker>
<p>O Mr. Banker, have you—'tis he <stage>(looking at Young Pranks with joy)</stage> thanky, Sir. <stage>(Curtsies to Old Pranks.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="99" facs="105"/>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Tom, here's a girl that wou'd have barter'd all her little fortune for your freedom; and now as you hope for mine, take her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Why, she's daughter to the Red Lion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Aye, my honest landlord, that reliev'd the sufferers, while you were swallowing peaches in December, and the poor shivering in cold and nakedness. Red Lion, Dick! where honour's derived from benevolence; she's daughter to a nobleman. What say you, my girl?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KITTY.</speaker>
<p>Only, Sir, that my heart is fill'd with gratitude; but you must ask the Red Lion's consent; for tho' you were a husband for a queen, I wou'd not have a prince, if it might grieve an indulgent parent.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> TOBY <hi>and</hi> JOHN GRUM, <hi>with</hi> MAGGS, <hi>(his dress very much disordered and torn.)</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>TOBY.</speaker>
<p>Your worship, here's the defender is obstropolos, and has lick'd I and John Grum.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAGGS.</speaker>
<p>Aye, dem'me, I plump'd 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Was't you, Natty? I'm sorry that my irregularities shou'd have involv'd you in this trouble.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="100" facs="106"/><hi>Enter</hi> Mrs. MAGGS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. MAGGS.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Natty Maggs—my child to be haul'd and maul'd—but this comes of your denying me your honour'd mother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Haul'd and maul'd—may the son never get better usage who cou'd deny his parent.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> BARLEYCORN <hi>and</hi> TULLY, <hi>bringing in</hi> BAREBONES.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BARLEYCORN.</speaker>
<p>Dang my buttons, you shall—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>What's this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TULLY.</speaker>
<p>Only this devout preacher walks into Mr. Barleycorn's and crams himself like a great fowl; then walks off without discharging his shot; when ask'd, says he, you'll be paid above, and says Mr. Barleycorn, by who there? and says he, why by Abdiel; so they walk'd up stairs to me, where I was taking a pint and a whiff of tobacco. I was christen'd Mr. Tully, so I walks down—but who ever saw an angel with a pipe in his mouth? I don't mind paying for a man's dinner; but, Sir, be so kind as to send this geatleman to jall. How do ye do, Mrs. Maggs?</p>
<stage>(Bowing.)</stage>

<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>My Saint George's Fields landlord!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BAREBONES.</speaker>
<p>The spirit openeth my mouth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TULLY.</speaker>
<p>You opened your mouth to swallow a leg of lamb, honey.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BAREBONES.</speaker>
<p>All things shall be in common with the righteous?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TOBY.</speaker>
<p>Pay me for sarving capias on Muster Pranks.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Me! how?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OLD PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Capias! What, you villain, are you that Ham Barebones that has lent my nephew money at an exorbitant usance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>That, like the devil, tempted me by the means, and now punishes me for the sin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TULLY.</speaker>
<p>Talk of righteousness! and bilk the house of an honest industrious man. <stage>(Lays hold on Barebones.)</stage></p>

<p>Mrs. Peregrine <stage>(to Whimmy.)</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>DIAN.</speaker>
<p>Dearest father, your blessing. <stage>(They kneel to Whimmy.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TULLY.</speaker>
<p>There, my blessing on you both, you two souls. <stage>(Puts his hand on their heads.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Then, my dear uncle, I take my lovely Kitty Barleycorn, and whilst her gentle qualities convince our friends, that birth and rank are not necessary to constitute an amiable wife, my respect for her virtues may prove, that the thoughtless prodigal can make a good husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I'm happy! ha! ha! ha! We've all got so very generous. Peregrine, with his little fortune, have Dian and all my wealth; your nephew, with your riches, takes little Kitty Barleycorn with nothing at all; and ecod, Mrs. Maggs looks so spruce, that I could find in my heart to— <stage>(going up to her.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. MAGGS.</speaker>
<p>Now that's so like Mr. Olmondle, <stage>(smiling and advancing.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WHIMMY.</speaker>
<p>Oh! <stage>(runs from her.)</stage></p>
</sp>

<speaker>TULLY.</speaker>
<p>And now, Mrs. Maggs, you will be drinking the apricocks.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUNG PRANKS.</speaker>
<p>Then, Sir, shall we be merry. Here ends my seven years hermitage, and, instead of my annuity, I shall think myself nobly rewarded, if my extravagant tricks and fancies can, by an indulgent smile, receive the forgiveness of my generous friends.</p>
