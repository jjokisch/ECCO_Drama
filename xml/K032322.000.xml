<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>H, <hi>Inis!</hi> My Indisposition is not to be cur'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>Not without applying the proper Medicine <hi>I</hi> grant ye.—Well, had I such a Confessor as Father <hi>Bernardo—</hi>I say no more—but I sancy nothing wou'd trouble my Conscience long.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="6"/>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<l>What do you mean?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>My Meaning depends upon yours, Madam; pray what do you mean by painting Farther <hi>Bernardo</hi>'s Picture in every Room in the House, at your Beds-head, your Toilet, at the Bottom of your Crucifix, at every Corner of your Handkerchief, nay upon your very Fan too, as if the Good Father, like the Traveller in the Fable, cou'd heat and cool at once?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Is there any harm in wearing a good Man's Picture? Is he not one of the Pillars of our Church? Eminent for de claiming against Herisy and Schism, and fain wou'd reconcile the World to <hi>Rome</hi> s pure Religion? Oh they are blest that he Converts, happy the Pair, who e'er they be, that are in Wedlock joyn'd by him. Wou'd I had been one of those.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>If the Good Father has this healing Art, Why are you uneasy? A little of his comfortable Consolation wou'd revive the Colour in those Cheeks, and give great Satisfaction to your Mind, or I have lost my Judgment, and I don't use to be out in my Guess, where Love's the Riddle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Well, since thou hast hit my Distemper so exactly, Girl, I'll confess ingeniously to thee, I do love Father <hi>Bernardo</hi> to Distraction, but how to discover my Passion, or what Reception it may meet with when discover'd, is that which wracks me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>A kind one I warrant you, Madam: For tho' Priests are forbid to marry, as a mortal Sin, Fornication was never reckon'd
<pb n="3" facs="7"/>
more than Venial; and for Discovery, whilst there's Pen, Ink, and Paper in the World, a Woman can never be at a loss to tell her Mind. Write to him Madam, write to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>But who shall carry it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>Your <hi>Irish</hi> Footman; he's a simple honest Fellow, and may easily be manag'd; do you write your Letter, Madam, and I'll give him Instructions in the mean Time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I'll do it this Minute.</p>

<p>Well Mrs. <hi>Inis;</hi> What Commands have you for Teague now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>Do you think you can do a Message cunningly, <hi>Teague?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teague.</speaker>
<p>Cunningly! Yes Faith, we are all so cunning now—What for a Message is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>It is a Letter for Father <hi>Bernardo</hi> at the Convent of St. <hi>Francis;</hi> if you do it handsomly, a Moider is your Reward; do you hear, but if you make any Mistake—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teague.</speaker>
<p>Hub, bub, bub, bu, Mistake! No Faith won't I, Arra! An will you be after giving me the Moider indeed, and by my Shoul now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>Upon Honour.—</p>

<p>Arra, say no more now—I will be here agen in a Quarter of an Hour.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Inis.</speaker>
<p>Ha ha; no, no, <hi>Teague,</hi> that won't do; come along with me, and I'll give you the Letter; but if you shou'd meet my Master <hi>Don Pisalto,</hi> not a Word of the Letter for your Life—And I charge you to give it into no Hands but the Priests, and bring me an Answer, and then the Moider is your own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teague.</speaker>
<p>Faith will I.—</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Exeunt.</stage>

<p>Arra, pon my Shoul, I have forgot this plaguy Priest's Name—Yes Faith have I—Father <hi>Bom, Bom, Bom,—</hi>By St. <hi>Patrick</hi> I don't know who to ask for now—Arra, What shall I do?—Who the Devil shall I get to read the Outside of this Letter now?</p>
</sp>

<p>Whither are you going with that Letter Sirrah? It is my Wives Hand,</p>

<p>Ha ha, pon my Shoul, a very good
<pb n="5" facs="9"/>
Jest, first reads the Direction, and then asks me whither it goes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Pis.</speaker>
<p>It may not prove so good a Jest as you think Sirrah—Who gave you that Letter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tea.</speaker>
<p>Arra Maistre, you are very uncivil now to enquire into other Folks Business, so you are, yes Faith are you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Pis.</speaker>
<p>I shall be so very uncivil to break your Head Rascal, if you don't answer me to the Purpose; give me the Letter you Dog you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tea.</speaker>
<p>Faith won't I—That's the Way to lose the Moider, which I am to have for carrying it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Pis.</speaker>
<p>A Moider for carrying it! Sure the Business must be very urgent, when the Postage is so dear. Give it me, I say, or or,</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Lays his Hand to his Sword.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Tea.</speaker>
<p>No pon my Shoul won't I.</p>

<p>Won't you Sirrah?</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Draws, and beats him.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Tea.</speaker>
<p>Arra, take the Letter <stage>(throws it down)</stage> Pox upon me, if I don't wish the Devil had you both, yes Faith do I; for poor <hi>Teague</hi> loses his Moider now, and Mrs. <hi>Inis</hi> will never send me of no more Arrands, no Faith won't she.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Pis.</speaker>
<p><hi>Inis,</hi> Ho! Did she give it you—</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Opens it.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Tea.</speaker>
<p>Yes indeed now, and I believe there is some very great Sin in the Letter now, that the Good Father was to send his Pardon for, so I do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Don Pis.</speaker>
<p>Monstrous! What do I see? Yes here is a Sin with a Witness— <stage>(Reads)</stage> Dear Father, you'll forgive me when I tell you, that the more I see you, the more I hate my Husband, <stage>(very fine)</stage> and the more I pray against Temptation, the more powerfully my Inclinations plead in your Behalf, <stage>(Furies and Distraction,)</stage>—I implore your charitable Assistance to conquer this unruly Sin— <stage>(Yes I'll help you with a Vengance to you)</stage>—Nothing but your Company can prolong the Life of <hi>Flora.</hi> <stage>(Say you so Mistress?</stage> Very well. <hi>Inis</hi> gave you this Letter you say!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tea.</speaker>
<p>Yes Faith did she—Arra dear honny Maistre, an you have don with the Letter give it now, that I may carry it to the Good Father, what de ye call him, or I shall lose the Moider, yes Faith shall I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Pis.</speaker>
<p>Ha! A lucky Thought comes into my Head, and this Fellows Simplicity is of use: Hark ye, <hi>Teague,</hi> come you along with me, I am acquainted with Father <hi>Bernardo,</hi> I'll procure you an Answer to this Letter—It is as you say, a Letter of Confession, and I believe <hi>Inis</hi> might not perform Articles with you, if she knew I had seen it; but take you no Notice of that, do you hear—And there is two Moiders for you Sirrah.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Tea.</speaker>
<p>Oh. by my Shoul <hi>Teague</hi> is dumb—Now I shall have three Moiders; Faith this is a lucky beating for poor <hi>Teague;</hi> now will I drink St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Health till I am as red as a Potato, yes Faith will I</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Bernardo.</speaker>
<p>I have had very odd Dreams to Night; methought I was in Bed with Lady <hi>Pisalto—</hi>Ah, wou'd it was true, for she is a charming Woman; by St. <hi>Anthony</hi> I never hear her Confession, but my Virtue is much stagger'd; the Flesh and Spirit hold strong Contention; Oh, she's a delicious Morsel.</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Don Pisalto.</stage>
<p>Ha! Her Husband, I hope did not overhear me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Pis.</speaker>
<p>So, I have dispatch'd the <hi>Irishman.</hi> Ha! Father <hi>Bernardo,</hi> well met; I was going to your Convent, I have a Favour to ask of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bern.</speaker>
<p>You command me, Senior, <hi>Pisalto,</hi> pray what is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Pis.</speaker>
<p>Why I must desire you to procure me a Habit of your Order for an Hour or two.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bern.</speaker>
<p>I hope you have no Enterprize in View, that may scandalize the Priesthood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Pis.</speaker>
<p>Fy, fy, does a Man of my Years give you Room for Suspicion? Besides, I am a married Man you know.</p>

<p>A Curse of the Happiness—Her Virtue, and your Sanctity, Father, might have begot a Monster, call'd a Cuckold, if Fortune

<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Pis.</speaker>
<p>I say I am contented, Father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bern.</speaker>
<p>Contented! Why another Man wou'd be transported, ravish'd, nay almost guilty of Idolatry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Don Pis.</speaker>
<p>Humph! There wou'd have been fine Work if they had come together; Oh, these Priests are full of Abstinence, and Piety! <stage>(Aside)</stage> If you'll oblige me with a Habit, let it be immediately, and I shou'd be proud if you'd give me your Company this Evening to sup with my Wife and I; I'll assure you Father, she has a profound Respect for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bern.</speaker>
<p>I am much oblig'd to her, Senior, I'll not fail to accept your kind Invitation, come along with me and I'll give you the Habit.—A profound Respect for me—Oh, that it were Love.</p>
