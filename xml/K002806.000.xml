<head>PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
<p>IF there is any Thing, in my Writings, that deserves to be remember'd, They will <hi>live,</hi> without Patronage: If They ought to be forgotten, They wou'd <hi>die,</hi> in spite of Protection. So I commit them to the World, unsustain'd by <hi>Dedication.—</hi>No Patron's Authority can protect a <hi>bad</hi> Work.—And a <hi>good</hi> one can want no Protection.</p>
<p>I am afraid, we need look no farther, than the <hi>Dedications</hi> of our Poetick Writings, for the Source of that <hi>Neglect,</hi> which the <hi>Art, Itself,</hi> complains of.—While Poetry preserv'd its Honesty, it was consider'd with Distinction; But, when it degenerated into a Traffick, between <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Reward,</hi> it became despis'd, like the Gold of <hi>Utopia,</hi> not by Ignorance of its Value, but through scorn of the Use, It was put to.</p>
<p>Before I speak of the following Tragedy, I am oblig'd to take Notice of another, the first Dramatic Sally of my Youth: And which, I shou'd be asham'd to confess, I had the Folly to begin and finish in a Week, but that I have Occasion, from that Confession, to hope Pardon of its Faults; and admire the <hi>English Good-nature,</hi> which receiv'd it, with undeserv'd Indulgence.—It was written on the same Subject with <hi>This,</hi> (upon Mr. <hi>Booth's</hi> recommending it to my Choice.) It was, also, acted at the same Theatre; and is, still, a Living Evidence, against me, under the Name of <hi>Elfrid;</hi> or, the <hi>Fair Inconstant.</hi></p>
<p>As I knew nothing of the Rules of Writing, the Play was, consequently, an unprun'd Wilderness of Fancy, with here and there, a Flower, among the Leaves; but without any Fruit, of Judgment.—I know not how it came to pass, that <hi>Athelwold,</hi>
<pb facs="4"/>
even in That Piece, deserv'd some little Pity: But, I am afraid, I was too Dull a Painter, to hit a Likeness for the Ladies.<hi>—Elfrid</hi> suffer'd more, by <hi>my</hi> ill Conduct, than Her own; and was a lighter <hi>Inconstant,</hi> than the Histories of those Times have shown her: And, as for <hi>Edgar,</hi> The Monarch came out of <hi>my</hi> Hands, as one of his Successors, out of the Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria</hi>'s; stript of Every Thing that became his Condition, and only a King in his <hi>Title.</hi></p>
<p>I therefore consider'd myself as not deserving Pardon, from the Publick, till I had purchas'd it, with something, <hi>Better,</hi> on the same Subject.—This was the Original of <hi>Athelwold.</hi></p>
<p>The New Play has neither Thought, Design, nor Expression, in the least, resembling the Old one; And my only Reason, for troubling the Reader with this little Story, is, because, shou'd there be any Thing in the second Attempt, greatly Preferable to the First, it will be a <hi>Proof,</hi> that Fancy (for, to say <hi>Genius,</hi> wou'd be making bold, with what is none of my own,) wants the Aid of the Judgment; and shou'd have Regard to the <hi>Rules,</hi> of an Art, which, like Religion, had an Orthodox Establishment; but (like that too) has been warp'd, and weaken'd, by mysterious Dullness, and the dry Pride of Commentators.</p>
<p>I am unable to execute any Thing in Poetry, if I have <hi>wasted</hi> the Care, I bestow'd on this Tragedy:—Nor can I have so unjust an Opinion of the Publick Taste, (tho I think Nobody will celebrate it, for Poetry,) as not to know, that shou'd there be Merit in <hi>Athelwold,</hi> there are Spirits, in the Nation, who have Influence, and Generosity, to awaken others, into their Sentiments.—I say this, for the sake of the <hi>Stage;</hi> for, as to myself, the Distinction of Deserving to be <hi>Read,</hi> is all the Advantage I propose from my Writings.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. WILKS.</stage>
<lg>
<l>OUR Author's Wishes, partial to the Stage,</l>
<l><hi>Not</hi> for himself, your Favour wou'd engage:</l>
<l>Not his own Cause, but ours, he wou'd defend,</l>
<l>Nor fears an Enemy,—nor tasks a Friend:</l>
<l>But, frankly, bids me <hi>own,</hi> that from <hi>his</hi> Plays,</l>
<l>He <hi>means</hi> no Profit, and <hi>deserves</hi> no Praise.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet, has he <hi>one</hi> fond Passion to impart;</l>
<l>One favourite Weakness, that has warm'd his Heart!</l>
<l><hi>Constant,</hi> he doats on a declining Fair;</l>
<l>Yet, recommends his Mistress to <hi>your</hi> Care;</l>
<l>Tho' past her <hi>Bloom,</hi> still <hi>tempting</hi> she appears,</l>
<l>A <hi>mid-ag'd</hi> Matron,—of three thousand Years!</l>
<l>Slight not <hi>Dame Tragedy,—</hi>nor fancy, Sirs,</l>
<l>That <hi>Pain,</hi> and Spleen, and Age, alone, are hers:</l>
<l><hi>Old,</hi> as you think her, still, she <hi>moves,</hi> and <hi>warms,</hi></l>
<l>Smiles thro' the Soul, and swells the Heart with Charms.</l>
<l>But the vain <hi>Prude,</hi> too coy, to yield, at Pleasure,</l>
<l>Vows, she'll be <hi>wedded,—</hi>or withhold her Treasure.</l>
<l>Take her, to <hi>Wife;—</hi>the Match cou'd ne'er be wrong,</l>
<l>But, for one Quality—she'll <hi>live</hi> too long.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Cou'd ye, for once, forgive the <hi>serious</hi> Strain,</l>
<l>And bear a useful Truth, undress'd, and plain?—</l>
<l>Fain wou'd the Muse remind you, that the <hi>Stage</hi></l>
<l>Receiv'd most Honour, from the <hi>wisest Age.</hi></l>
<l><hi>Athens</hi> shone brightest, when the crowded <hi>Scene</hi></l>
<l>Fir'd her bold Sons,—to <hi>dare,—</hi>to <hi>act,—</hi>to <hi>mean!</hi></l>
<l>Greatly, to <hi>copy</hi> the departed <hi>Great,</hi></l>
<l>And <hi>be</hi> the Chiefs, they learnt to <hi>emulate.</hi></l>
<l><pb facs="6"/>
Warm'd, by this Heat, which to their <hi>Plays</hi> they ow'd,</l>
<l>The guided Passions of a <hi>People glow'd:</hi></l>
<l>High beat their cherish'd Hearts, in Glory's Cause;</l>
<l>Firm stood their Freedom, and long liv'd their Laws:</l>
<l><hi>Charm'd</hi> into Virtue, and by <hi>Pleasure</hi> taught,</l>
<l>The raptur'd Youth, the meant Impression caught,</l>
<l>Grew up to Greatness, Liberty, and Arts,</l>
<l>And snatch'd the <hi>Heroe</hi>'s, from the <hi>Player</hi>'s Parts.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Oh! cou'd we live, to hail the future Day,</l>
<l>When sparkling Folly shall give <hi>Genius</hi> way;</l>
<l>When <hi>low, light, Scenes</hi> shall tempt the Eye, in vain;</l>
<l>And <hi>Passion</hi>'s Power impress the Heart, again;</l>
<l>Then shall the Muses, like their Monarch, smile,</l>
<l>And <hi>all</hi> Heaven's Blessings crown his happy Isle!</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by Mrs. BOOTH.</stage>
<lg>
<l>THIS whining Tragedy has made me hoarse,</l>
<l>Yet, as an Epilogue's a Thing of course,</l>
<l>I can't help telling ye, before we part,</l>
<l>I'm glad my Husband's dead, with all my Heart:</l>
<l>That's one Confession,—and one more shall be,</l>
<l>I wish the Author were as dead as he:</l>
<l>His <hi>murdering</hi> Muse, in downright Love of teizing,</l>
<l>Kills <hi>one,</hi> for <hi>being pleas'd,</hi> and one, for <hi>pleasing:</hi></l>
<l>Stabs <hi>Ethy—</hi>'cause <hi>her</hi> Love was an untrue one,</l>
<l>Drowns <hi>my</hi> good Man, because he lik'd a new one:</l>
<l><hi>Lud! Lud!—</hi>what Work 'twou'd make among the <hi>Fair;</hi></l>
<l>Shou'd every <hi>Belle</hi> be <hi>drown'd,</hi> that loves a <hi>Pair:</hi></l>
<l>And, as for <hi>Beaux,—</hi>who make no Bones of erring,</l>
<l><hi>They'd</hi> fill the Seas, all round, like Shoals of Herring!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>A fine Example, truly! don't it <hi>move</hi> ye?</l>
<l>Were it well follow'd—how 'twou'd soon <hi>improve</hi> ye!</l>
<l>Send ye, in Pairs, to Heav'n, where good Folks Trust is,</l>
<l>Martyrs, Lord help ye! of <hi>Poetic Justice!</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>I, for my Part, had a <hi>sweet</hi> Race to run,</l>
<l>I,<hi>—not</hi> to be a Queen;—must be a<hi>—Nun!</hi></l>
<l>No, Ladies, have a care os that:—The Poet</l>
<l>Belies the Story,—and, thank Heaven! I know it:—</l>
<l><hi>Elfrid</hi> was <hi>wiser,</hi> and the King was <hi>kinder;</hi></l>
<l>Even, in the Convent, <hi>he</hi> knew how to find her:</l>
<l>He, pious Prince! lov'd Penitence so well,</l>
<l>That, oft, he trac'd it to the loneliest Cell;</l>
<l><hi>Confess'd</hi> the Saints <hi>Himself—</hi>bless'd Occupation!</l>
<l>Freely bestow'd his <hi>Princely</hi> Consolation;</l>
<l>And <hi>eas'd</hi> the <hi>Father Girards</hi> of the Nation.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="8"/>
<l>Nay, tis no laughing Matter—I am <hi>serious,</hi></l>
<l>I meant no Mischief, I:—no Hint mysterious!</l>
<l>Ask <hi>Hollinshead;—</hi>He'll tell ye, if tis new t'ye,</l>
<l>That <hi>Edgar</hi> was a Lyon—at <hi>Church Duty.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l><hi>One</hi> of His Virtues needs must Envy raise,</l>
<l>He was the veriest <hi>Patriot,</hi> of His Days!</l>
<l>He, not to <hi>Maids,</hi> alone, thought Pity due,</l>
<l>His will, <hi>unwearied,</hi> work'd for <hi>Husbands,</hi> too.</l>
<l>Dependent Princes sent their Wives, by th' Dozen,</l>
<l>To <hi>tax</hi> This Bounty of their Royal Cozen!</l>
<l>And Eight <hi>dubb'd</hi> Monarchs, of his own Creation,</l>
<l><hi>Row'd</hi> him, in grateful Triumph, round the Nation.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>This being so—what does our Author Merit,</l>
<l>Who wrongs a Prince—of such a <hi>Publick Spirit!</hi></l>
<l>Hang him, dull Poet!—I'll say nothing for him,</l>
<l>In good King <hi>Edgar's</hi> Quarrel, I abhor him:—</l>
<l>Take him among ye,—and, if e're you'd mend him,</l>
<l>To some <hi>kind Jesuit,</hi> for new Notions, send him.</l>

<l>Why kept we not the Sea? Those unseen Shoals</l>

<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>Shame on this Pride</l>
<l>That swells the Hearts of Kings!—But that I shunn'd</l>
<l>His wide-stretch'd Navy, whose expanded Wings</l>
<l>Inclos'd you empty Triumph, we had, in Safety,</l>
<l>Held on our Course for <hi>Lancaster,—</hi>and <hi>Edgar,</hi></l>
<l>And <hi>Chester</hi>'s dreaded Walls, been pass'd, unseen.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elsrid.</speaker>
<l>Why shunn'd you <hi>Edgar?</hi> You had struck no Shoal,</l>
<l>Had Jealousy not wreck'd you. Where was the Danger,</l>
<l>Had we, amid the shouting Swarms, approach'd</l>
<l>His glitt'ring Barge? that, proud of eight Kings Rowing,</l>
<l>Methought, mov'd, conscious of her glorious Freight,</l>
<l>And felt her Sovereign's Triumph!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l><hi>Edgar</hi> is young,</l>
<l>Am'rous, impatient, hot as the Summer Sun;</l>
<l>But as the Shadow changing.<hi>—Emma,</hi> the Sister</l>
<l>Of <hi>Leolyn,</hi> my Friend, must be his Queen.</l>
<l>That Day once past, that Day, now near, my <hi>Elsrid,</hi></l>
<l>Trembling no longer, for my Soul's best Treasure,</l>
<l>I shall unveil thee to the Eye of <hi>Edgar:</hi></l>
<l>Then, in full Lustre, break upon the Court,</l>
<l>Charm the glad World, and swell the Voice of Wonder.</l>
<l>Till then—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elsrid.</speaker>
<l>Till then, you think, a Woman's Honour</l>
<l>Is safest when not trusted?—Come, be wise;</l>
<l>Laugh at your Sex's Notions, and see Truth,</l>
<l>Unprejudic'd by Maxim. You have been taught</l>
<l>That a Man's Caution guards a Woman's Vertue:</l>
<l>Believe me, 'tis an Error.—Wrong'd by the Doubt,</l>
<l>We make that Doubt our Licence, and grow <hi>light,</hi></l>
<l>To justify Suspicion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>Of thee not jealous:</l>
<l>I fear the Heart of <hi>Edgar:</hi> There is a Secret</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="11"/>
Which, yet, thou must not know!—For all the Glory</l>

<speaker>Elsrid.</speaker>
<l>Why chuse you then</l>
<l>To lodge me in the Gardens of his Palace?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>Safely conceal'd, in my Apartment, there,</l>
<l>While Triumph busies the tumultuous Court,</l>
<l>Fair as thou art, thou may'st remain unknown,</l>
<l>Till soon we re-imbark for <hi>Lancaster:</hi></l>
<l>But Fate has driven me under <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Eye,</l>
<l>Nor can I shun his Presence.— <stage>[A Shout at distance.</stage></l>
<l>The Barge, triumphant,</l>

<l>See! the broad Sprinklings from the golden Oars,</l>

<l>Scatter a liquid Lightning!—E're the King lands,</l>
<l>Retire, my Soul's soft Charmer. From this Boat,</l>
<l>That foremost strikes the Shore, descends a Lord,</l>
<l>Wily, suspicious, flatt'ring, base, and busy:</l>
<l>Malice and Fear divide his motley Soul:</l>
<l>Soft'ning Submission dwells on his cool Tongue;</l>
<l>But his Heart burns with Envy.—See! he lands;</l>

<l>Throw wide the brazen Gates of the Cathedral.— <stage>[Exit third Messenger.</stage></l>
<l>All this was well provided for, before;</l>
<l>But 'tis no Fault, to seem too diligent,</l>
<l>Where Bustling goes for Loyalty.—Earl <hi>Athelwold!</hi></l>
<stage>Re-enter Athelwold.</stage>
<l>Fortune befriend your Hopes, my noble Lord,</l>
<l>As she does ours: Who, on a Day like this,</l>
<l>When Sovereign <hi>Edgar</hi> triumphs like a God!</l>
<l>Brings back his Godlike Fav'rite, to partake</l>
<l>A Splendor, thought imperfect, wanting you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>Oh! 'tis too kind, my Lord, amidst your Cares,</l>
<l>To waste this fine Court Rhet'rick, on a Plainness</l>
<l>So unadorn'd as mine!—In War's big Pomp,</l>
<l>The King, sometimes, in the broad Battle's Front,</l>
<l>Finds <hi>Athelwold,</hi> most near him: But, for a Day</l>
<l>So safely plum'd as this, a thousand Feathers,</l>
<l>Loftier and far more gay than mine had been,</l>
<l>Were proud, no doubt, to wave in State about him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Nay, my good Lord! your Enemies must own</l>
<l>Your Valour's ablest Rival is your Reason.</l>

<l>Why will you angle, with too short a Line,</l>
<l>In Depths of cautious Honesty?—I <hi>know</hi> you.—</l>
<l>Why will you still, you and your envious Faction,</l>
<l>Bow, to the happy Favourite you hate,</l>
<l>And smile your Curses on me?—Shame on your Meanness!</l>
<l>If I deserve Esteem, give it, sincere:</l>
<l>If not, disdain to court the Man you fear,</l>
<l>And, with brave Truth, renounce me.</l>

From the best Means we use, to quench the old.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Edwyn.</speaker>
<l><hi>Egbert</hi> is warn'd, shou'd the King quit the Crowd,</l>
<l>And but approach the Garden, to conceal her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>Then I will fear</l>
<l>No longer, but expect the King; and meet him</l>
<l>With a mask'd Smile of Innocence.—O <hi>Edwyn!</hi></l>
<l>Should <hi>Ethelinda</hi> know I have married <hi>Elfrid,</hi></l>
<l>How wretched would it make her!<hi>—Oswald</hi> hates thee:</l>
<l>As if he read our Secret, through thy Heart;</l>
<l>Saw there thy gen'rous Silence, which conceals</l>
<l>My dearstol'n Night of Joy with that soft Charmer.</l>
<l>Who that saw both, could think <hi>her</hi> Neice to <hi>Oswald?</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edwyn.</speaker>
<l>So, my good Lord, would her false Servant say;</l>
<l>That doubly faithless Fair-one, who betray'd</l>
<l>To me her Lady's Honour, yet forsook me!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>She wrong'd her Mistress; but she lov'd <hi>thee</hi> surely!</l>
<l>Who, in that Secret, gave up both our Honours,</l>
<l>To thy safe Keeping.—But, since all was told thee,</l>
<l>'Twere now a fruitless Point of proud Reserve,</l>
<l>With thee, to keep that Silence, which the Favour'd</l>
<l>Shou'd hold, in rev'rence of a Lady's Honour,</l>
<l>As sacred as his Glory.—Oh! suppose not,</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="14"/>
Because she bless'd my Wishes, that <hi>Ethelinda</hi></l>
<l>Yielded like common Beauties.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edwyn.</speaker>
<l>'Twas plain, You lov'd her;</l>
<l>For, when her Horse was drown'd, in <hi>Severn</hi>'s Ford,</l>
<l>You, from your own, leapt, rash: Thro' the swol'n stream,</l>
<l>Plung'd on, and snatch'd her, sinking.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>True, I lov'd her,</l>
<l>But lov'd her with <hi>Desire:</hi> while, in <hi>Her</hi> Breast,</l>
<l>Love, which, at first, was gen'rous Gratitude,</l>
<l>Drew all its Warmth from Pity.—Never, never,</l>
<l>Shall I forget, how blissfully I won her!</l>
<l>'Twas the dear Night, before this fatal Journey;</l>
<l>I found her, <hi>Edwyn,</hi> sunk on her Couch, alone,</l>
<l>Weeping, with am'rous Grief, for coming Absence:</l>
<l>Loose and enchanting-negligent her Dress;</l>
<l>Faint was her Air; and a kind nameless Languor</l>
<l>Sigh'd, in short Heavings, from her soften'd Heart;</l>
<l>And every Breath was Tenderness and Love!</l>
<l>There, while transported, on my trembling Knee,</l>
<l>Bending, I gaz'd, and hung devoutly o'er her,</l>
<l>Raptur'd, and charm'd, I plung'd amidst Attraction;</l>
<l>Sigh'd on her Eyes; breath'd o'er her panting Bosom,</l>
<l>And snatch'd her Soul, unguarded:—Millions of Vows,</l>
<l>Fierce, burning, Vows! of Everlasting Love,</l>
<l>Transport, and Marriage, and Eternal Truth,</l>
<l>Thaw'd her reluctant Vertue to Belief:</l>
<l>Then—in the soft Desire's new Warmth, I press'd her,</l>
<l>Till, in the beating Tumult of her Heart,</l>
<l>She gave—she knew not what—nor meant Compliance!</l>
<l>Fortune renounce me, <hi>Edwyn,</hi> but my Reason</l>
<l>Prefers her, even to <hi>Elfrid:—</hi>My Passion did not.</l>
<l>The Love she felt for me, I feel for <hi>Elfrid;</hi></l>
<l>And am unwillingly undone—like Her.</l>
<stage>A warlike Symplony.</stage>
<l><pb n="7" facs="15"/>
Hark!—the King lands. Th'avenging Hand of Heaven</l>
<l>Points out my Baseness.—How shall my guilty Eye</l>
<l>Meet the wrong'd Goodness of the Royal <hi>Edgar!</hi></l>
<l>How shall I skreen the Charms of injur'd <hi>Elfrid</hi></l>
<l>From the King's sight!—What shall my bleeding Heart</l>

<l>ALL this is false in Reason; but your Eloquence,</l>

<l>Too cold for Love, in all this cruel Length</l>

<l>That is,</l>

<l>Honour, in Love, is silence.—But two such Friends</l>
<l>As you and <hi>Athelwold,</hi> cannot, methinks,</l>
<l>Have fought an am'rous Quarrel.—Your Rival's Thoughts</l>
<l>Are fill'd with high State Projects? something like Jealousy</l>
<l><pb n="21" facs="29"/>
Of Trust suppos'd betray'd?—some Plot? some Schemings?</l>
<l>Some Aim your Caution started at? or which</l>
<l>Your Oath to <hi>Edgar</hi> check'd your wish'd Assent to?</l>
<l>Something like this, no doubt, provok'd proud</l>

<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>No matter.—Fear him not. <hi>Oswald</hi> has Power:</l>
<l>And can procure you the King's Thanks, perhaps,</l>
<l>Ev'n against favour'd <hi>Athelwold.—</hi>As for his Tale</l>
<l>Of <hi>Ethelinda;</hi> Women are passive Agents;</l>
<l>And, when Love prompts them, can out-suffer Martyrs.</l>
<l>I wou'd not swear he wrongs her: yet I think so.</l>
<l>Believe him not, till I have sounded her.</l>
<l>Half <hi>Wales,</hi> with <hi>Leolyn,</hi> a Prince restor'd,</l>

<l>Lord <hi>Oswald,</hi></l>

<l>And my free Thoughts range open as my Eye-balls.</l>
<l>Wrong'd as I am by <hi>Athelwold,</hi> my Heart</l>
<l>Disdains to hide his Virtues.—He may have wishes:</l>
<l>He may deceive, in Love, but not in Loyalty.</l>
<l>A brave Man cannot serve a Prince, and wrong him.</l>

<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l>Nobly remark'd.—In Faith your Honour charms me!</l>
<l>We live in dang'rous Times, and Men must learn</l>

Too brave for forc'd Submission.—Stir not to follow me:</l>

<l>The conscious Grandeur of her inborn Pride</l>
<l>Inflames her, for a Queen! Aw'd by her Frown,</l>
<l>I stood, insensible, and unresolv'd,</l>
<l>Nor knew that I obey'd her.—How blind is Love!</l>
<l>Who wou'd have hop'd, this Soft'ner of my Soul,</l>

<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>PAtience!—Curse Patience: why dost thou talk of Patience,</l>
<l>With the same Breath, the same cold, tasteless, Calmness</l>
<l>That spoke Distraction to me? Hast thou not told me</l>
<l>That she confesses it? that this proud Beauty,</l>
<l>This haughty, fierce, disdainful, marbly Vertue,</l>
<l>That scorn'd <hi>my</hi> honest Passion; this austere Frowner!</l>
<l>Has been—Perdition on the Name! 'Twou'd choak me.—</l>
<l>Hast thou not fir'd me with the basest Truth</l>
<l>That ever stung the Heart of a Fool Lover!</l>
<l>And dost thou talk of Patience?—Give it to Statesmen;</l>
<l>I spurn the servile Lesson. Patience! said'st thou?</l>
<l>Rage and Despair have broke upon my Soul,</l>
<l>And wash'd away all Patience.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l>My Spirit,</l>
<l>Thank Heaven! is none of these wild fiery Racers;</l>
<l>That, like a Spark in Flax, if not strait smother'd,</l>
<l>Burns up the Road it runs thro'; yet I feel Warmth,</l>
<l>When chaf'd by Provocation: And let me tell you,</l>
<l>There may be ways, and we may find 'em, Prince,</l>
<l>To reach this proud Presumer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>I must not aid thee:</l>
<l>He was my Friend; and then, my Life was his,</l>
<l>By Tie of Duty.—He was, since, my Enemy;</l>
<l>And then, again, 'twas his, by Claim of Conquest.</l>
<l><pb n="30" facs="38"/>
I've lost Revenge, to Honour.—I have no Right</l>
<l>To lift my Arm against him: For, from a Hand</l>
<l>Oblig'd as mine has been, Justice itself</l>
<l>Would redden into Murder.—But, were I <hi>Oswald,</hi></l>
<l>Wrong'd, as thou art, and free to weigh those Wrongs,</l>
<l>Without this Counterpoise of Obligation,</l>
<l>I would hunt <hi>Athelwold</hi> to the World's Verge;</l>
<l>Nay, would leap after him, and snatch at Vengeance,</l>
<l>Through the unfathom'd Depth of dark Eternity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l>I too, perhaps,</l>
<l>Who have as light a Spring as you, Prince <hi>Leolyn,</hi></l>
<l>Might try that dreadful Leap, could I be sure</l>
<l>That it was bounded, <hi>but</hi> by Depth and Darkness:</l>
<l>But, shou'd there lie some Realm of Light beyond,</l>
<l>I should look foolishly, when I fell through,</l>
<l>To find my State grown worse than 'twas before,</l>
<l>And no Road back again.—Methinks, 'tis strange,</l>
<l>That you, hot Fighters, Friends of bare-fac'd Anger,</l>
<l>Have never learnt our safer courtly Art</l>
<l>Of Vengeance without Danger!—You injure me,</l>
<l>And I assault you openly:—Man against Man</l>
<l>Gives Chance an equal Cast: 'Tis you or me:</l>
<l>Suppose, as first you wrong'd, you, now, shou'd kill me?</l>
<l>Where's Vengeance then?—What Equity is here!</l>
<l>No;—let me pay th' Affront, with a first Blow,</l>
<l>Whereby I hazard nothing: That sets us equal;</l>
<l>And, if I not strike home, he's, then, at liberty</l>
<l>To stand on even Terms, and try, once more.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>What dar'st thou do, for <hi>Ethelinda</hi>'s Honour?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l>Force him—to please her on, and marry her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>He cannot marry her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l>Why truly, he who has, unmarried, won</l>
<l>What others marry for, will wed at leisure.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="39"/>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>Cannot,—I say.—Death! thou art such a Trifler!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l>If you had said he <hi>wou'd not</hi> marry her,</l>
<l>Your Doubt had err'd, with Likelihood.—But that a Man</l>
<l>Has taught a Maid what Wives alone should learn,</l>
<l>And <hi>cannot</hi> therefore make that Maid his Wife,</l>
<l>Is a new Point in Logick!—Troth, I have seen</l>
<l>The Court thick sown with these instructed Virgins,</l>
<l>Who all grew up, to Husbands; and, sometimes,</l>
<l>Have ev'n learnt on, for Life, from their first Teachers.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>Tire me no more, with this provoking Lightness,</l>
<l>Upon a Theme that stings me.—I tell thee, he cannot;—</l>
<l>Mark me,—he <hi>cannot</hi> marry <hi>Ethelinda;</hi></l>
<l>Because—he has already married <hi>Elfrid.—</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l><hi>Elfrid!</hi> what <hi>Elfrid?</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>Why, that far-nois'd <hi>Elfrid;</hi></l>
<l>What is her Father's Name? The Western Duke?—</l>
<l>Death!—I remember nothing:<hi>—Cornwall:—</hi>He:</l>
<l>The Duke of <hi>Cornwall.—</hi>She! whose fancied Charms</l>
<l>The King was wise enough to chuse this <hi>Athelwold,</hi></l>
<l>His Ear's Engrosser, and his Eye's Pourveyor,</l>
<l>To go and look at for him.—A strange mad Humour</l>
<l>Work'd in his Brain, that she might prove his Idol,</l>
<l>His wild Church Shadow that you have heard him talk of:</l>
<l>You know it as well as I.—What do you gaze at?</l>
<l>You listen as if I prophesied!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l>'Tis Prophecy!</l>
<l>And happily foretels the long-wish'd Downfal</l>
<l>Of our State Column.—This <hi>Atlas Athelwold!</hi></l>
<l><pb n="32" facs="40"/>
Who bears the Heaven of Favour on his Shoulders,</l>
<l>And shadows all beneath him.—But, are you sure?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>I told it, not to aid thy dark Designings,</l>
<l>But to lament the ruin'd <hi>Ethelinda.</hi></l>
<l>What will Fate do with that unhappy Charmer?</l>
<l>Honour forbids me, now, to wish her mine;</l>
<l>And he who has undone her is another's</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Edgar</hi> hastily.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>Who is another's?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l>The Prince, provok'd to Warmth,</l>
<l>By News scarce credible, and lost in Wonder,</l>
<l>We heard not, Royal Sir! your near Approach.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>What News? What Wonder?—Warm?—The Prince was warm?</l>
<l>Yes;—The hot <hi>British</hi> Blood, your Country's Proverb,</l>
<l>The Lightning of your Tempers, flames, I find,</l>
<l>To its full Violence.—What mad Presumption</l>
<l>Licens'd your Arroganee, so near my Presence,</l>
<l>To quarrel with Earl <hi>Athelwold</hi> to Day,</l>
<l>Whose Friendship is your Fortune?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>Sir,—a Prince,</l>
<l>Tho' Fortune wrongs him, in Restraint of Power,</l>
<l>Thinks, like a Prince, as when his Throne sustain'd him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>His Throne? Proud <hi>Leolyn!</hi></l>
<l>Thy Father was a Rebel.—Detected Treason</l>
<l>Inverts the vanquish'd Traitor's Property,</l>
<l>And he and his lost Blood are Forfeits, all.</l>
<l>—I love the fearless Bravery of free Spirits;</l>
<l><pb n="33" facs="41"/>
But thy blind Fierceness shocks me.—Urge it no farther:</l>
<l>A moving Pity pleads thy Cause within me;</l>
<l>Nor wish I, thou shouldst blast it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l>Gracious Sovereign!</l>
<l>The Prince, unlike his Father, fought your Cause;</l>
<l>And startles me with News, which (when I tell you</l>
<l>It joins the Names of <hi>Athelwold—</hi>and Traitor)</l>
<l>Will justify the Wonder it has given me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>Traitor—and <hi>Athelwold?</hi> Profane Conjunction!</l>
<l>As well might the two Poles be press'd, to join,</l>
<l>And crush the unbelieving World, between them.</l>
<l>—Take heed, rash Men! when ye dare touch the Honour</l>
<l>Of envied <hi>Athelwold,</hi> that ye not fail</l>
<l>To prove his Guilt, till, like a Sun-beam's Glare,</l>
<l>It dazzles my Faith's Eye, and makes it weep;</l>
<l>Or your vile Malice shall but fan the Fire,</l>
<l>That kindles to consume ye?—What has he done?</l>
<l><hi>Leolyn?—Oswald?—</hi>Speak:—One of ye, speak?—</l>
<l>Or must I wait, till you invent some Wile,</l>
<l>To skreen your trembling Envy?—What wou'd ye say</l>
<l>Of <hi>Atheldwold?</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l>Prince <hi>Leolyn</hi> asserts,</l>
<l>That he has married the fam'd Western Beauty,</l>
<l>And has describ'd her falsly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar</speaker>
<stage>, after a Pause.</stage>
<l>Malicious Ignorance!</l>
<l>Oh! that the Power that rules the Heart of Man</l>
<l>Wou'd, ever, thus, make Mischief impotent!</l>
<l>—See now this Falshood! Learn to know this Traitor!</l>
<l>This <hi>Athelwold!</hi> whom your inferior Souls</l>
<l>Want Sympathy to judge of?—His Heart's Refinement,</l>
<l><pb n="34" facs="42"/>
His Elegance of Will, adorning Duty,</l>
<l>Has plotted, with a Subject's sweet Deceit,</l>
<l>To cheat his King, to Extasy!—By Heaven</l>
<l>I had not known, but for your bold mistaking,</l>
<l>That he had form'd this dear Design against me.</l>
<l>To Night he means, when Triumph's weary Noise</l>
<l>Is hush'd in Darkness, and my Mind, unbent,</l>
<l>Has room for mighty Pleasure, to surprize me;</l>
<l>To pour upon my unexpecting Soul</l>
<l>A Tide of Gladness. He but held it back,</l>
<l>To make its Flow more welcome.—But I have seen her;</l>
<l>Thou, too, hast seen her, <hi>Oswald.—</hi>The big Joy</l>
<l>Bears down all Mem'ry, that you both presum'd</l>
<l>To wrong the Man I love; and I forgive it,</l>
<l>That you may learn to <hi>worship Athelwold!</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oswald.</speaker>
<l>Nay, I have ever said, even to his Enemies,</l>
<l>That he was form'd for Loyalty!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>This doubling Statesman's Baseness, and the Joy</l>
<l>Of his imperious Master, have uprooted</l>
<l>The Prudence of my Patience:—I must speak,</l>
<l>Tho' every Glance of his disdainful Eye</l>
<l>Shot a new Ruin at me.—Sir!—by this Transport</l>
<l>Of a bless'd Lover, near his promis'd Joy,</l>
<l>Judge of the Vastness of my Sister's Grief;</l>
<l>Whom lone Despair, and Sense of hopeless Love,</l>
<l>Abandon to Distraction.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>Is it well done</l>
<l>To chuse this Time, this Place, and this rash Manner,</l>
<l>To goad a conscious Frailty?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>To-morrow, Sir,</l>
<l>Had been too late: For, when your Heart is fill'd</l>
<l>With <hi>Elfrid,</hi> and with Rapture, how should I hope</l>
<l><pb n="35" facs="43"/>
There can be room, for Thoughts of a past Promise,</l>
<l>Or absent <hi>Emma</hi>'s Claim?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>Now, by the Stings,</l>
<l>Which thy abrupt, unartful Insolence</l>
<l>Has rouz'd, to fix their Points on my touch'd Heart,</l>
<l>The Power of Millions, warring on my Realms,</l>
<l>Shou'd never force me to thy Sister's Arms.</l>
<l>Had she a Charm, for every Fault of thine,</l>
<l>Nature has curs'd her with one single Stain,</l>
<l>That blots out all her Vertues. The Part, she shares</l>
<l>Of thy rebellious Blood, is Bane to Love.</l>
<l>—O <hi>Athelwold!</hi> how am I blest in thee!</l>
<l>The Guilt of others, held against thy Worth,</l>
<l>Reflects it stronger on me.—Well may Traitors</l>
<l>Malign thy Loyalty. Antipathies</l>
<l>Hate, by the Law of Nature.—Take his Sword:</l>
<l>Why have I Power, if not to curb Presumption,</l>
<l>When it insults my Pity?—</l>
<l>See him a Prisoner in the Castle-Tower?</l>
<l>And, when I am no longer angry,—ask me</l>
<l>What I resolve concerning him? <stage>[Exit Edgar.</stage></l>

<l>Dissemble your Concern; and I will move him</l>
<l>To stir in your Behalf, and reconcile you</l>
<l>To the King's Pardon.</l>

<l>You are well-met, my Lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>Oh!—wou'd I were!</l>
<l>The Time has been, when if we two were met,</l>
<l>There was no World beyond us.—</l>
<l>But, now, I wander, like some fabled Ghost,</l>
<l>Trembling, and earnest to impart his Secret,</l>
<l>Yet wanting Power to speak it.</l>

<speaker>Ethelinda.</speaker>

<l>Such Ghosts, they say,</l>
<l>Wait, to be spoke to, first; then, they reveal</l>
<l>Their dreadful Wills, and vanish.—'Twill be thus</l>
<l>With your proud Heart: Soon as I have accus'd you,</l>
<l>Cover'd with Shame, your Answer will be short,</l>
<l>Confus'd, and fatal; and you will vanish from me,</l>
<l>Alas! I fear, for ever.—Look on me, <hi>Athelwold!</hi></l>
<l>Raise your fal'n Eyes:—They once cou'd gaze, delighted,</l>
<l>And hung their Beams on mine, as both were form'd,</l>
<l>Of one divided Flame, which parted, hard,</l>
<l>And struggled for Re-union.—Teach 'em, once more,</l>
<l>To fix an unmov'd, stedfast, Look upon me;</l>
<l>Hold them, thus earnest, nor decline their Lids,</l>
<l>Till you have answer'd me this one sad Question:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>What have I done, that could deserve, from <hi>Athelwold,</hi></l>
<l>That he should boast my ruin'd Peace, to <hi>Leolyn?</hi></l>
<l>Your conscious Eye sinks, guilty.—My Lord! my Lord!</l>
<l>The Virtue that inspires this gen'rous Shame,</l>
<l>Had shewn a nobler Influence, had it taught you,</l>
<l>That Insult, always base, is doubly so,</l>
<l>When he who caus'd the Crime, upbraids it too.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>Can you believe me so deprav'd a Wretch,</l>
<l>So lost to Honour, Gratitude, and Shame,</l>
<l>As to be conscious of a purpos'd Guilt,</l>
<l>Thus infamously vile?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ethelinda.</speaker>
<l>I do, by Heaven!</l>
<l>Nay, know you guilty; for, since I saw you last,</l>
<l>My Uncle cruelly reproach'd me with it,</l>
<l>And told me, you proclaim'd it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>Proclaim'd it! No:</l>
<l>I am unhappy, but I am not base.</l>
<l>It were too long, and too perplex'd a Tale,</l>
<l>While Misery lies, unloaded, on my Heart,</l>
<l>To undeceive thee, now.—If thou believ'st</l>
<l>I am that low unmanly Wretch thou speak'st me,</l>
<l><pb n="42" facs="50"/>
Take this dishonour'd Sword, pierce my false Breast,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ethelinda.</speaker>
<l>What would'st thou tell me?</l>
<l>Thou tremblest! and I read some dreadful Meaning,</l>
<l>That struggles to break on me!—Why wilt thou kneel?</l>
<l>There glows a gen'rous Tenderness about thee,</l>
<l>Which half absolves thy Purpose, and bids me hear thee</l>
<l>With Firmness, and with Pity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>Oh! <hi>Ethelinda!—</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ethelinda.</speaker>
<l>Out with it,—speak,—Wou'dst thou not say,—I hate thee?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>No, by my Soul, tho' Time has chang'd my Love,</l>
<l>'Tis chang'd, but as the Diamond, that grows brighter,</l>
<l>And lost but Dust, in polishing.—'Tis, now,</l>
<l>No more a fierce wild Flame; but, in its Place,</l>
<l>Truth, calmer, and more lasting. 'Tis soft Respect;</l>
<l>'Tis tender Thought, kind Will, and grateful Mem'ry.</l>
<l>'Tis Friendship.—'Tis such Love as Angels feel,</l>
<l>Who mix their meeting Fires;—and <hi>flame</hi> together.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ethelinda.</speaker>
<l>Such was the false, the artful Eloquence,</l>
<l>That lur'd me to my Ruin. But my Heart,</l>
<l>Instructed by Distress, can now read Meanings.</l>
<l>Who, that is new in Passion, could believe,</l>
<l>That this fair Picture, of thy faded Love,</l>
<l>But proves, thou lov'st another?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>What wilt thou say,</l>
<l>When thou shalt hear me own, That Fear is just?</l>
<l>When I confess, abhorrent of Deceit,</l>
<l>That Love, which seem'd to root my Soul in thee,</l>
<l>Has new transplanted it, to <hi>Elfrid</hi>'s Bosom?</l>
<l>You start! as if my Guilt were yet a Secret,</l>
<l>Tho' <hi>Leolyn,</hi> confesses he has told it:</l>
<l><pb n="43" facs="51"/>
For, in his ill-retaining Breast, I trusted</l>
<l>The fatal Secret, of my double Falshood,</l>
<l>Both to my King, and thee. He should have added,</l>
<l><hi>How</hi> I was lost.—That Will, and Faith, and Reason,</l>
<l>At once gave Way, beneath a Weight of Passion;</l>
<l>And against Judgment, Honour, Love of thee,</l>
<l>Fame, and Allegiance, I was born away,</l>
<l>Till she, who should have been my Master's Queen,</l>
<l>Deceiv'd, like thee, became,—oh!—turn aside</l>
<l>Thy Eyes—while I have Voice to say—my Wife.</l>
</sp>

<l>I pity thee So mean a Stratagem,</l>
<l>Shamefully form'd, to force me upon <hi>Leolyn,</hi></l>
<l>And free thee from the Pain of long dissembling.</l>
<l>Go on,—that I may teach my Heart to hate thee.</l>
<l>This low Contrivance, this poor Trick of Art,</l>
<l>Is baser than Inconstancy!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>Sorrow, like mine,</l>
<l>Sinks the sad Heart too low, for Artifice,</l>
<l>And my proud Soul out-swells, and floats above it.</l>
<l>That I am lost, beyond Redemption lost,</l>
<l>My Roof, that once grew proud, in Hopes of thee,</l>
<l>Conceals too clear a Witness.—Yet may'st <hi>thou</hi> curse me,</l>
<l>If I not rev'rence and esteem thee, still,</l>
<l>With my Heart's inmost Softness. Thy Power improves,</l>
<l>Ev'n by Defection. Lost, to my frailer <hi>Sense,</hi></l>
<l>My <hi>Soul</hi> adores thee, like some nameless Being,</l>

<l>In her Deportment,</l>

I may have Cause to blush at, when I've learnt</l>
<l>To whom I owe this Favour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ethelinda.</speaker>
<l>You owe it, Madam,</l>
<l>To the too liberal Will of one, whose Favours</l>
<l>More of your Sex, than you, have been oblig'd to.</l>
<l>So kind a Purposer, as <hi>Athelwold,</hi></l>
<l>Means much, he leaves imperfect.—You had rather</l>
<l>He should have come, his own Ambassador,</l>
<l>Than sent a Representer, such as I am;</l>
<l>Unqualified to smooth your angry Brow,</l>
<l>That frowns cold Welcome at me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elfrid.</speaker>
<l>I frown, indeed!</l>
<l>To hear the Name of <hi>Athelwold</hi> pronounc'd</l>
<l>With this familiar Licence!—Sure! You know him</l>
<l>With more than common Intimacy, Madam,</l>
<l>Who treat him with this Frankness?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ethelinda.</speaker>
<l>If to have been his Intimate,</l>
<l>May licence Frankness toward him, the Court has Claimers,</l>
<l>Who can dispute their Title to your Lover,</l>
<l>By Rights, of longer Date, and juster Tenure,</l>
<l>Than those you hold him by.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elfrid.</speaker>
<l>Your Pardon, Madam,</l>
<l>I find, I was mistaken in your Purpose;</l>
<l>But 'twas my Woman's Error. She inform'd me,</l>
<l>You came <hi>from Athelwold.</hi> Had she said <hi>for</hi> him,</l>
<l>I should have better known with what Respect</l>
<l>To entertain your Visit.—On my Word,</l>

<l>To be so coldly look'd at.</l>

<l>Though he told me,</l>

I took you for a Shadow. But, I perceive,</l>
<l>His Falshood may be trusted, when he speaks</l>
<l>Of his own Baseness.—Think me not abrupt.—</l>
<l>If Oaths had Power to bind, he should be mine.</l>
<l>Triumphant in the prosperous Pride of Beauty,</l>
<l>Your easy Scorn insults the Miserable,</l>
<l>Unconscious of their Anguish.—Sense of lost Peace,</l>
<l>Perhaps, transported an afflicted Heart,</l>
<l>And I appear'd too warm.—</l>
<l>I shall no more invade your wish'd Repose;</l>

<l>How base,</l>

<l>Stop.—Say no more.</l>
<l>Art not thou <hi>Athelwold?</hi> Let me look on thee.—</l>
<l>No:—By thy sacred Empire, in my Heart,</l>
<l>It cannot be.—I am at Peace, again.</l>
<l>Go on—thy Enemies, in vain, accus'd thee;</l>
<l>But thy own Words alarm'd me.—Yet, my glad Eyes</l>
<l>Have trac'd thee over, and absolve that Form,</l>
<l><pb n="52" facs="60"/>
Even from the Power to harbour a mean Mind,</l>
<l>Unsuited and deceitful.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>What can I say?</l>
<l>Guilt, when it meets Suspicion, or Reproach,</l>
<l>Sustains itself, within, and learns to balance</l>
<l>Offence, by Punishment. But where it finds</l>
<l>Compassion, and has wrong'd a gen'rous Confidence,</l>
<l>It ought to blush, in Blood; and has no Way</l>
<l>To Pardon, or to Peace, but this—through Death.</l>

<l>Hold thy rash Hand—And, like <hi>my</hi> Subject, learn,</l>

<l>One, brave, as Thou art, shou'd have Guilt, to justify</l>
<l>This Fear of a Friend's Eye?—Is <hi>Elfrid</hi> mine?</l>
<l>Or, trusted with the Wants that press'd my Soul,</l>
<l>Hast thou, instead of giving, robb'd me of more,</l>
<l>And left thy Prince a Bankrupt? Unbless'd by Love,</l>
<l>And yet depriv'd of Friendship!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>What has not Love</l>
<l>Made Honour guilty of!—Turn, Royal Sir,</l>
<l>Turn your Eyes inward, and, in <hi>Emma</hi>'s Tears,</l>

<l>How cou'd weak <hi>Athelwold</hi> expect to conquer,</l>

<l>Heav'n! 'tis Thy Hand,</l>

<l>And shame us into Justice!—True, I have err'd;</l>

<l>Which thou nor dar'st to speak, nor I to hear.</l>
<l>By <hi>Elfrid</hi> won, from <hi>Emma;</hi> Love, in me,</l>
<l>Prov'd but too strong for Love. In thee, not Love,</l>
<l>To Love was treacherous.—But Love, to Honour,</l>
<l>To Friendship, Loyalty, to sworn Obedience;</l>
<l>To all the violated Laws of Life!—</l>
<l>What Subject, though unfavour'd, dares invade</l>
<l><pb n="53" facs="61"/>
His Sovereign's Claim?—But, when that Subject is</l>
<l>A Servant too, bound by the double Tie,</l>
<l>Of Duty and Allegiance; when, beyond all,</l>
<l>His King, his Master, whom he wrongs, selected him;</l>
<l>Treasur'd his Hopes and Wishes, in his Heart;</l>
<l>Liv'd in his Breast; partial but in <hi>his</hi> Cause;</l>

<l>The injur'd Stranger, strong, by Despair's wild Rage,</l>
<l>Breaks, like a Tempest, from your Servant's Care,</l>
<l>And meditates Destruction. No Voice but yours</l>
<l>Will calm her into Patience.—In her Heart's Anguish,</l>
<l>She calls on <hi>Athelwold,</hi> till Shrieks of Woe</l>
<l>Eccho, from Tower to Tower, your Fatal Name,</l>
<l>And the wide Castle rings, with her Reproaches.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Go—and appease her Grief, thou Source of Sorrow!</l>
<l>Free my dim'd Eyes from aching at thy Presence,</l>

<l>What thou should'st suffer, from a Prince's Hand,</l>
<l>Who is this Wretch, by thine! <stage>[Exit Athelwold.</stage></l>
<l>Too fatal Beauty!</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elfrid.</speaker>
<l>If, in your royal Heart, I hold such Influence,</l>
<l>Abate your Wonder at my Power in <hi>Athelwold</hi>'s.</l>
<l>Why were you Friends, but that your Souls had Sympathy,</l>
<l>And purpos'd, each like other?—'Tis scarce a Moment,</l>
<l><pb n="54" facs="62"/>
Since I first learn'd, that when he press'd his Passion,</l>
<l>He wrong'd his Sov'reign's Meaning: Yet, already,</l>
<l>I find the Fault most yours.—Love is a Leveller,</l>
<l>And all Degrees are equall'd, where he reigns.</l>
<l>Why was another sent, if <hi>Edgar</hi> lov'd me?</l>
<l>Why was not <hi>Cornwall</hi> honour'd by your Presence,</l>
<l>When your unnumber'd Navy swept her Coasts,</l>
<l>In your last Guardian Circuit?—Had you then landed,</l>
<l>Indulgent to my loyal Father's Prayer,</l>
<l>From what a dreadful Length of destin'd Woe,</l>
<l>Had my sad Heart been guarded!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>I saw thee, first,</l>
<l>Unknowing thou wer't <hi>Elfrid,</hi> at the dread Altar,</l>
<l>Where, from our aweful <hi>Dunstan</hi>'s holy Hands,</l>
<l>The consecrated Oil confirm'd me King.—</l>
<l>How wer't thou lost, so soon?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elfrid.</speaker>
<l>Swear but to pardon</l>
<l>The gen'rous, tho' unfaithful, <hi>Athelwold,</hi></l>
<l>And I will shew you, we were doom'd unhappy,</l>
<l>But by the Will of Heav'n.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>Kings shou'd be just:</l>
<l>And such compulsive Oaths, too lightly sworn,</l>
<l>Make That Necessity, which might be Choice,</l>
<l>And strip the Grace from Mercy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elfrid.</speaker>
<l>Then hear <hi>my</hi> Vow:</l>
<l>Since you decline to bind your doubtful Will,</l>
<l>Thus, on my Knees, all-powerful Heav'n! my Soul</l>
<l>Appeals thy righteous Throne.—Hear,—and afflict me</l>
<l>With every woful Curse, thy Wrath has stor'd</l>
<l>For Perjury, if ever I consent</l>
<l>To quit the Breast, or Claim, of <hi>Athelwold.</hi></l>
<l>Or, should he fall, by your revenging Hand,</l>
<l><pb n="55" facs="63"/>
If I not shun, for ever, even to Death,</l>
<l>The Sight, the Voice, the Name, of Royal <hi>Edgar.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>Cruel, cold, proud, disdainful,—glorious <hi>Elfrid!</hi></l>
<l>What has thy Rashness sworn?—Yet, let me perish,</l>
<l>If to have sworn it, has not made thy Loveliness</l>
<l>As awful as Divinity!—Was ever</l>
<l>Distress thus hopeless? Could your untouch'd Heart</l>
<l>Have Sense of what mine suffers, you wou'd have fear'd</l>
<l>To wound me, with this Pain of fix'd Despair.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elfrid.</speaker>
<l>Now, shielded by the Safeguard of my Oath,</l>
<l>Virtue may speak, secure, and own its Weakness:</l>
<l>There was a Time, e'er <hi>Athelwold</hi> was mine,</l>
<l>When, to have been the Wife of uncrown'd <hi>Edgar,</hi></l>
<l>Wou'd have been more than Monarchy, to <hi>Elfrid.—</hi></l>
<l>Fatally curious, from the deep Impression</l>
<l>Of an alarming Dream, I saw you crown'd,</l>
<l>Hid, in a clam'rous Press, that shouted, round me,</l>
<l>And shook the sacred Dome, with Peals of Joy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>Oh! tell it me again.—Was I so bless'd,</l>
<l>That you then thought with Tenderness on <hi>Edgar?</hi></l>
<l>What was that Dream? Charm me, thou rising Wonder,</l>
<l>With each soft Circumstance of pleasing Pain:</l>
<l>For, while I die, with Terror of my Fate,</l>
<l>'Tis Heav'n to hear it, from a Voice like thine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elfrid.</speaker>
<l>Oh! sooth not Misery.—Forbear to speak</l>
<l>With this untimely, this forbidden, Softness!</l>
<l>Aw'd, by Rememb'rance of my dreadful Dream,</l>
<l>I tremble, ign'rant of the Will of Heaven,</l>
<l>Too dimly gleam'd upon my distant Soul.</l>
<l>I dreamt I sat, and saw th' Imperial Crown</l>
<l>Plac'd on your sacred Head: Your Form the same,</l>
<l>As when I, after, view'd you at the Altar,</l>
<l>And, fainting with Reflection, left the Throng!</l>
<l>Soon as the Diadem adorn'd your Brow,</l>
<l><pb n="56" facs="64"/>
You turn'd, methought, with Brightness more than mortal,</l>
<l>Held it, presented thus; and, high in Air,</l>
<l>Stept to the Seat that bore me! When strait a cold,</l>
<l>A shadowy Hand divided us: Loud Shrieks</l>
<l>Rung thro' the Temple: The gay Pomp was darken'd,</l>
<l>And a broad Sea of Blood rose high, between us,</l>
<l>And bore us from each other.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>Thy ominous Dream</l>
<l>Creeps, in cold Tides, and curdles all my Veins.</l>
<l>Seek we, thou lost Inflamer of Desire,</l>
<l>The false, the fated <hi>Athelwold.—</hi>My Heart</l>
<l>Heaves, with unusual Bodings. Powerful Pity</l>
<l>Struggles with Justice; and 'tis more painful to me,</l>
<l>To think, my Friend, should fall, to <hi>need</hi> Forgiveness,</l>
<l>Than to forgive my <hi>Enemy.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elfrid.</speaker>
<l>This is, indeed,</l>
<l>To reign! So reigns the World's supreme Disposer.</l>
<l>All Things, but one, are subject to his Power;</l>
<l>But even his Pow'r, itself, obeys his Mercy.</l>
<l>Proud of Dominion, yet enslav'd to Fear,</l>
<l>Kings who love Blood, thro' one long Tempest steer,</l>
<l>While the calm Monarch, who with Smiles controuls,</l>
<l>Roots his safe Empire, and is King of Souls.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>When Woman, form'd to soften Man to Peace,</l>
<l>Fans his Disquiet, and gives Care Increase,</l>
<l>Love is a Weakness, and to wish in vain,</l>
<l>Were a forc'd Freedom, and Escape from Pain:</l>
<l>But where our Hearts are charm'd, by Forms like thee,</l>
<l>Where Passions sympathize, and Souls agree,</l>
<l>There to love hopeless, is, in Life, to die,</l>
<l>And, languid, in void Blanks of Being, lie.</l>

Till my wrong'd Heart had Weakness, to believe,</l>
<l>And <hi>share</hi> the Pains I gave, I knew no Grief:</l>
<l>Honour, and Peace, and Innocence were mine:</l>
<l>I never felt a Wish, that was my own,</l>

<l>Shun'd, hopeless, blasted, infamous, and scorn'd;</l>
<l>Cut off from every social Joy of Life;</l>
<l>Pitied by others, hated by myself,</l>

<l>Who made my tortur'd Heart, and knows it best,</l>
<l>Till <hi>Elfrid</hi>'s fatal Beauty forc'd my Will,</l>
<l>I never had a Wish, beyond thy Love.</l>
<l>My Hopes dwelt on thee, and my doating Soul</l>
<l>Drew Taste and Purpose from thee. At thy Voice</l>
<l>Awaken'd Life leapt, list'ning, to my Ear,</l>

<l>Thou wer't Possession and Desire, combin'd,</l>

<l>'Tis what I wish, and merit. I deserve</l>
<l>All Punishments, but Life, with Loss of <hi>Elfrid.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elfrid.</speaker>
<l>Shock'd, and unworthy a Debate, like this,</l>
<l>I shou'd be still less worthy, cou'd I hear it,</l>
<l>Unconscious of the Wound it gives my Honour.</l>
<l>—Oh! Thou, Eternal Ruler of the World!</l>
<l>Here, by thy dreadful Name, I kneel and swear,</l>
<l>I will be neither <hi>Athelwold</hi>'s nor <hi>Edgar</hi>'s.—</l>
<l>Safe, at Thy Altar's consecrated Foot,</l>
<l>In some still Convent's solitary Gloom,</l>
<l>Aweful Religion shall benight my Eyes,</l>
<l>And hide me from the World.—There will I weep,</l>
<l>And wish myself forgotten.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>Oh!—recall,</l>
<l>Explain, or limit, the too-hasty Vow.</l>
<l>Thou mean'st but to retire, till I am dead,</l>
<l>Or till his Death who wrong'd thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Elfrid.</speaker>
<l>Shou'd he fall</l>
<l>For me, may Heav'n refuse my parting Soul,</l>

<l>Thou blind Profaner! <stage>[A Shriek without.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>That alarming Shriek</l>

<l>For One, more wretched yet,—more lost, than I.</l>

<l><hi>Athelwold!—</hi>Come back.</l>

<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>A Curse on Guilt;</l>
<l>It sinks the Brave, to Cowards!—It was, once,</l>
<l>My Heart's proud Joy, to meet my Sovereign's Eye.</l>
<l>'Tis, now, my Soul's worst Torment.—Hide me, Earth,</l>
<l>From <hi>Edgar</hi>'s angry Brow: From my own Shame,</l>
<l>Not Death itself can hide me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>I have bethought me,</l>
<l>That Love and Fate deny, we both should live;</l>
<l>The Heart of <hi>Elfrid,</hi> when thou art no more,</l>
<l>May teach her to forget thee.—I, or Thou,</l>
<l>Must fall.—It was the King's Intent to pardon</l>
<l>The Subject's Treason. The <hi>King</hi> does forgive thee;</l>
<l>But the <hi>Friend</hi> cannot pardon.—Let us, then,</l>
<l>On equal Terms, dispute our doubtful Claim,</l>
<l>To Death and Quiet, or to Life and <hi>Elfrid.</hi></l>
<l>Here I renounce Distinction, give Allegiance</l>
<l>To the wild Winds, as thou hast done, before,</l>
<l>And seek an Equal's Vengeance for my Wrongs. <stage>[Draws.</stage></l>
<l>—I know that I descend, and that the Throne</l>
<l>Disdains a Subject Foe. But I disclaim</l>
<l>That cold Prerogative of a King's Safety;</l>
<l>To teach thee, that I need no borrow'd Pow'r:</l>

Myself the Guardian of my injur'd Honour,</l>

<l>O gen'rous <hi>Edgar!</hi> my Imperial Master,</l>
<l>Whose Spirit reigns, distinguish'd among Souls,</l>
<l>As among Kings, thy Person; think me not,</l>
<l>How plung'd soever in the Guilt of Falshood,</l>
<l>So lost to Sense of the unmeasur'd Distance,</l>
<l>Between my Prince and me, to dare defend</l>
<l>One aching Atom of this hated Breast,</l>
<l>Against a Wound he wishes me.—No; take <stage>[Lays his Sword at the King's Feet.</stage></l>
<l>My Sword.—It has been drawn, with some Success,</l>
<l>In your lov'd Cause; direct it to the Heart</l>
<l>Of this new Traitor. At your sacred Feet,</l>
<l>The tainted Blood will flow, with willing Waste,</l>
<l>And wash away the Mem'ry of his Crime,</l>
<l>Who lives too long, when he not lives for you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>Rise, and provoke me, if thou would'st be kind,</l>
<l>By some wish'd Mark of Arrogance.—Presume,</l>
<l>Talk insolently of thy Worth; defy me;</l>
<l>Smile at my Sword's rais'd Point; threaten,—accuse,—</l>
<l>Deny,—Calumniate.—Any Thing, but this!</l>
<l>Spare this soft Sorrow, hide this sweet Humility,</l>
<l>And I shall keep my Purpose.—O <hi>Athelwold!</hi></l>
<l>Why hast thou pain'd my Soul, with this sharp Conflict?</l>
<l>Why hast thou wrong'd me, into Will to hurt thee? <stage>[Throws down his Sword.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>How ill shou'd I deserve your unwish'd Mercy,</l>
<l>Did not my Life become more odious to me</l>
<l>Than was the Guilt I fall for!—From my Birth,</l>
<l>With fix'd, unalterable, deadly Hate,</l>
<l><pb n="66" facs="74"/>
I punish'd faithless Rebels. Trust me, now,</l>
<l>Against myself. My Sovereign shall not need</l>
<l>Revenge his Wrongs, on <hi>Athelwold.—</hi>One Pray'r</l>
<l>Has Boldness, yet, to urge your royal Ear;</l>
<l>Then, I have done with Wishes, and the World.—</l>
<l>Prince <hi>Leolyn,</hi> whom I have made unhappy,</l>
<l>Now suffers, for my Guilt. So greatly wrong'd,</l>
<l>I shall not rest, in Death, till your try'd Goodness</l>
<l>Permits his Freedom, and bestows on Him</l>
<l>My forfeit Honours, and the Lands I leave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>I charge thee, as thy Heart wou'd wish my Pardon,</l>
<l>Attempt not on thy Life. Wait, and expect</l>
<l>Thy Doom, from the slow Workings of my Soul,</l>
<l>That labours to resolve, but knows not how;</l>
<l>For <hi>Leolyn,</hi> thy gen'rous Wish has mov'd me.</l>
<l>Go—bring him to my Presence.—I will walk,</l>
<l>And meditate, alone, till thy Return. <stage>[Exit Athelwold.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<stage>[Alone.]</stage>
<l>How shall I move, in this dark Maze of Passion!</l>
<l>'Tis true, my Favourite has betray'd me, basely;</l>
<l>But he was first, himself, betray'd by Love;</l>
<l>That Tyrant of the Heart, more King than I,</l>
<l>Ranks Monarchs with his Slaves.—Let me weigh</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold</speaker>
<l>By my own Wishes, and, then, punish <hi>him,</hi></l>
<l>When I can see, unmov'd, those Eyes which charm'd him.</l>
<l>How shall I act? at once, to shield my Fame,</l>
<l>And satisfy my Love.—Cou'd Reason's Force</l>
<l>Tear the unlicens'd Image from my Heart,</l>
<l>Or, patient, leave to Time, th'unhasten'd Means,</l>
<l>To bless my fierce Desires; Who knows what Chance,</l>
<l>Or Death, or Thought, or Woman's changeful Will,</l>
<l>Or my own conquer'd Wishes, may produce.</l>
<l>—Kings should, however injur'd, do no Wrong:</l>
<l><pb n="67" facs="75"/>
They cannot err <hi>alone,</hi> since what They act,</l>
<l>They authorize in others.—Let me, then,</l>
<l>Extinguish low Desires, lest, at <hi>my</hi> Flame,</l>
<l>I light a Nation's Wishes.—I will strive</l>
<l>To check this rising Passion; and forget</l>
<l>That she who charms me thus is in my Power,</l>
<l>Till I can bend that Pow'r, to Reason's Rule.</l>
<l>—They come!—I will avoid them,—and reflect</l>
<l>What Measures to resolve on. <stage>[Exit Edgar</stage></l>

<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>In this Place,</l>
<l>But now, I left the King.—A little farther,</l>
<l>And we shall find him, soon.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>Stay—for we find,</l>
<l>In these provided Swords, what well reminds us</l>
<l>Of our late Parting.—Thou hast perform'd thy Promise,</l>
<l>With Bravery so noble, that, again,</l>
<l>'Spite of my burning Wrongs, I almost love thee.</l>

<l>First, perish <hi>Leolyn.</hi></l>
<l>Didst thou not blast my Honour by a Blow?</l>
<l>Fir'd with a Ruffian's Boldness, strike a Prince!</l>
<l>And can he live to pardon?—Shame to thy Heart,</l>
<l>Or give my Glory the Revenge it claims,</l>
<l>Or I will brand thee with a Coward's Marks,</l>
<l>And teach light Boys to scorn thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>If it must be,</l>
<l>Spare me a Moment's Pause—'Twill soon be past,</l>
<l>And Death will want to Time to sate his Purpose.</l>
<l>—What shall I do?—To trust him with my Softness,</l>
<l>To tell him what, at my Request, the King</l>
<l>Was won to grant him, were to seem afraid,</l>
<l>And shrink from his Revenge.—O fatal Chain</l>
<l>Of long depending Woes, that Guilt is bound to!</l>
<l>Conflicting Passions blast the bad Man's Hopes,</l>
<l>And all his Thoughts are Whirlwind!—</l>
</sp>

<l>Come on.—</l>
<l>Thy Blow burns hot, and I will wait no longer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athelwold.</speaker>
<l>Hold<hi>—Leolyn!</hi> Be slow.—The Chance of Conquest</l>
<l>Is various, and unknown—and, shou'd I fall,</l>
<l>Thou wilt have Cause to grieve, thou didst not hear me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>Never—till Vengeance has been paid its Full,</l>

<l>With frantick Action, in a long, loud, Speech,</l>
<l>The poor distress'd Complainer talk'd, and wept</l>
<l>To the wild Oceani; told the Waves her Woes;</l>
<l>And, list'ning, earnest, oft, in dumb Suspence,</l>
<l>Paus'd, for an Answer:—'Till, at last, more shrill,</l>
<l>She scream'd Resentment, to the distant Deep.</l>
<l>—Thou art, she cry'd, as cold, and deaf, as <hi>Athelwold.</hi></l>
<l>Then, sudden, from her Breast, in rash Despair,</l>
<l>Snatching a Dagger.—She, with all the Rage</l>
<l><pb n="70" facs="78"/>

<l>Immortal,—and at Peace.</l>

<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l><hi>What!—</hi>Hast thou murder'd him?</l>
<l>Ungrateful, and detested! Murder'd <hi>Him!</hi></l>
<l>Him, who alone obtain'd thy Freedom from me;</l>
<l>And, in the gen'rous Anguish of his Guilt,</l>
<l>Pray'd, that his Titles, and his forfeit Lands,</l>
<l>Might all be <hi>Thine!</hi> whom, as he wrong'd in Life,</l>
<l>He could not rest in Death, to leave unhappy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leolyn.</speaker>
<l>This had been Daggers to my guilty Soul,</l>
<l>Could he have fall'n, by me:—But, like a God,</l>
<l>Who smiles, and pardons, when provok'd by Mortals,</l>
<l>He met my Rage, with a serene Contempt,</l>
<l>Master'd, a second time, my failing Sword,</l>
<l>And gave me Life, in Punishment.—Live, <hi>Leolyn!</hi></l>
<l>He cry'd, and spoke it with an Air unmov'd,</l>
<l>Superior, <hi>not</hi> insulting.—Live—and know,</l>
<l>That, had not conscious guilt a Point, more strong</l>
<l>Than thine,—No Wound could reach the Breast of <hi>Athelwold.</hi></l>
<l>—Yet, tho' he will not be <hi>compell'd</hi> to <hi>die,</hi></l>
<l>He chuses <hi>not</hi> to live;—for he has wrong'd thee.</l>
<l>Come, and see Justice done thee.—At that Instant,</l>
<l>The Shock of <hi>Ethelinda</hi>'s dreadful Fate,</l>
<l><pb n="71" facs="79"/>
Heard, as we pass'd, upon th' extended Terras,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<l>Go on.—</l>

<l>I saw him, Sir, as I drew near,</l>
<l>Raise his fall'n Victim, from the bloody Ground,</l>
<l>And, on his Cheek, support her bending Head;</l>
<l>But her weak Joints soft sinking from their Trust,</l>
<l>She hung sustain'd, and bled upon his Bosom.</l>
<l>He groan'd,—look'd wild,—call'd loud upon her Name,</l>
<l>And, for a Moment, stopt her flying Soul.</l>
<l>Twice, at his Voice, she stretch'd her dying Eyes,</l>
<l>And gasp'd,—and struggl'd,—and wou'd fain have spoke;</l>
<l>But, failing—in a short, convulsive, Sigh,</l>
<l>Breath'd out her Soul,—and sunk upon his Bosom.</l>
<l>He!—standing near the downfal of the Cliff,</l>
<l>Strain'd her, with Rapture, in his circling Arms,</l>
<l>O <hi>Leolyn!</hi> he cry'd, forgive me, <hi>now:</hi></l>
<l>Tell the wrong'd King, I leave his <hi>Elfrid,</hi> free,</l>
<l>And, thus, too late, do Right to <hi>Ethelinda.—</hi></l>
<l>Then, springing furious, o'er the dreadful Rock,</l>
<l>Leap'd, with the Dead, to Death!—Together, both</l>
<l>Fell, frightful, to the Deep; which, closing o'er them,</l>
<l>Veils them, from Sense of Woe, in Rest, forever.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edgar.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Great was his Guilt, and <hi>greatly</hi> 'tis aton'd!</l>
<l>Nothing is safe, but Innocence!—Be it your Care</l>
<l>To send out Boats, that their recover'd Bodies</l>
<l>May rest, beneath one Marble; over which</l>
<l>I will erect a Cloister, and endow it,</l>
<l>For hourly Prayers to Heaven, to rest their Souls.</l>
<l>—Haste, all! and watch th' afflicted <hi>Elfrid,</hi> near,</l>
<l>Assist her,—guard her,—wait, at her Apartment,</l>
<l>And save her, from her Sorrow.—</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb n="72" facs="80"/>
<l>Oh! <hi>Leolyn,</hi> be obstinately just;</l>
<l>Indulge no Passion, and deceive no Trust:</l>
<l>Let never Man be bold enough, to say,</l>
<l>Thus, and no farther, shall my Passion stray:</l>
<l>The first Crime, past, compells us into more,</l>
<l>And Guilt grows <hi>Fate,</hi> that was but <hi>Choice,</hi> before.</l>
