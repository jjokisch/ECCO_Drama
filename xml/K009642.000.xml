<head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE <hi>JOHN</hi> Lord <hi>SOMMERS,</hi> Lord-President of Her MAJESTY's most Honourable Privy-Council.</head>
<opener><salute>May it please your Lordship,</salute></opener>
<p>AS it's an Establish'd Custom in these latter Ages, for all Writers, particularly the Poetical, to shelter their Productions under the Protection of the most Distinguish'd, whose Approbation produces a kind of Inspiration, much superior to that which the <hi>Heathenish</hi> Poets pretended to derive from their Fictitious <hi>Apollo:</hi> So it was my Ambition to Address one of my weak Performances to Your Lordship, who, by Universal Consent, are justly allow'd to be the best Judge of all kinds of Writing.</p>
<p>I was indeed at first deterr'd from my Design, by a Thought that it might be accounted unpardonable Rudeness to obtrude a Trifle of this Nature to a Person, whose sublime Wisdome moderates that Council, which at this Critical Juncture, over-rules the Fate of all <hi>Europe.</hi> But then I was encourag'd by Reflecting, that <hi>Lelius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> the two greatest Men in their
<pb facs="3"/>
Time, among the <hi>Romans,</hi> both for Political and Military Virtues, in the height of their important Affairs, thought the Perusal and Improving of <hi>Terence</hi>'s Comedies the noblest way of unbinding their Minds. I own I were guilty of the highest Vanity, should I presume to put my Composures in Parallel with those of that Celebrated <hi>Dramatist;</hi> But then again, I hope that Your Lordship's native Goodness and Generosity, in Condescention to the Taste of the Best and Fairest part of the Town, who have been pleas'd to be diverted by the following SCENES, will excuse and overlook such Faults as your nicer Judgment might discern.</p>
<p>And here, my Lord, the Occasion seems fair for me to engage in a Panegyrick upon those Natural and Acquired Abilities, which so brightly Adorn your Person: But I shall resist that Temptation, being conscious of the Inequality of a Female Pen to so Masculine an Attempt; and having no other Ambition than to Subscribe my self,</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>By the Author of TUNBRIDGE-WALKS.</byline>
<lg>
<l>THO' modern Prophets were expos'd of late,</l>
<l>The Author cou'd not Prophesy his Fate:</l>
<l>If with such Scenes an Audience had been fir'd,</l>
<l>The Poet must have really been Inspir'd.</l>
<l>But these, alas! are Melancholy Days</l>
<l>For Modern Prophets and for Modern Plays.</l>
<l>Yet since Prophetick Lyes please Fools o' Fashion,</l>
<l>And Women are so fond of Agitation;</l>
<l>To Men of Sense I'll Prophesy anew,</l>
<l>And tell you wond'rous things that will prove true;</l>
<l><hi>Undaunted Colonels will to Camps repair,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Assur'd, there'll be no Skirmishes this Year;</hi></l>
<l>On our own Terms will flow the wish'd-for Peace,</l>
<l>All Wars, except 'twixt Man and Wife, will cease.</l>
<l>The Grand Monarch may wish his Son a Throne,</l>
<l>But hardly will advance to lose his own.</l>
<l>This Season most things bear a smiling Face;</l>
<l>But Play'rs in Summer have a dismal Case,</l>
<l>Since your Appearance only is our Act of Grace.</l>
<l>Court Ladies will to Country Seats be gone,</l>
<l>My Lord can't all the Year live Great in Town;</l>
<l>Where wanting <hi>Opera's, Basset,</hi> and a <hi>Play,</hi></l>
<l>They'll sigh, and stitch a Gown, to pass the time away.</l>
<l>Gay City-Wives at <hi>Tunbridge</hi> will appear,</l>
<l>Whose Husbands long have labour'd for an Heir;</l>
<l>Where many a Courtier may their Wants relieve,</l>
<l>But by the Waters only they Conceive.</l>
<l><pb facs="5"/>
The <hi>Fleet-street</hi> Sempstress—Toast of <hi>Temple</hi> Sparks,</l>
<l>That runs Spruce Neckcloths for Attorney's Clerks;</l>
<l>At <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Gardens will her Hours regale,</l>
<l>Sing fair <hi>Dorinda,</hi> and drink Bottl'd Ale.</l>
<l>At all Assemblies Rakes are up and down.</l>
<l>And Gamesters, where they think they are not known.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Shou'd I denounce our Author's Fate to Day,</l>
<l>To cry down Prophecies, you'd damn the Play:</l>
<l>Yet Whims like these have sometimes made you Laugh,</l>
<l>'Tis Tattling all, like <hi>Isaac Bickerstaff.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Since War and Places claim the Bards that write,</l>
<l>Be kind and bear a Woman's Treat to Night;</l>
<l>Let your Indulgence all her Fears allay,</l>
<l>And none but Woman-Haters damn this Play.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>IN me you see one <hi>Busie-Body</hi> more;</l>
<l>Tho' you may have enough of one before.</l>
<l>With Epilogues, the <hi>Busie-Body</hi>'s Way,</l>
<l>We strive to help, but sometimes mar a Play.</l>
<l>At this mad Sessions, half condemn'd e'er try'd,</l>
<l>Some, in three Days, have been turn'd off, and dy'd.</l>
<l>In spight of Parties, their Attempts are vain,</l>
<l>For like false Prophets, they ne'er rise again.</l>
<l>Too late, when cast, your Favour one beseeches,</l>
<l>And Epilogues prove Execution-Speeches.</l>
<l>Yet sure I spy no <hi>Busie-Bodies</hi> here,</l>
<l>And one may pass since they do ev'ry where.</l>
<l>Sowr Criticks Time and Breath and Censures waste,</l>
<l>And baulk your Pleasures to refine your Taste.</l>
<l>One busie Don ill-tim'd high Tenets Preaches,</l>
<l>Another yearly shows himself in Speeches.</l>
<l>Some snivling Cits would have a Peace for spight,</l>
<l>To starve those Warriors who so bravely fight.</l>
<l>Still of a Foe upon his Knees afraid,</l>
<l>Whose well-bang'd Troops want Money, Heart and Bread.</l>
<l>Old Beaux, who none, not ev'n themselves can please,</l>
<l>Are busie still, for nothing—but to teize</l>
<l>The Young; so busie to engage a Heart;</l>
<l>The Mischief done, are busy most to part.</l>
<l>Ungrateful Wretches, who still cross one's Will,</l>
<l>When they more kindly might be busie still!</l>
<l>One to a Husband, who ne'er dreamt of Horns,</l>
<l>Shows how dear Spouse with Friend his Brows adorns.</l>
<l>Th' Officious Tell-tale Fool (he shou'd repent it)</l>
<l>Parts three kind Souls that liv'd at Peace contented.</l>
<l>Some with Law-Quirks set <hi>Houses</hi> by the Ears.</l>
<l>With Physick one what he would heal impairs.</l>
<l>Like that dark mob'd up Fry, that neighb'ring Curse,</l>
<l>Who to remove Love's Pains bestow a worse.</l>
<l>Since then this medling Tribe infest the Age,</l>
<l>Bear one awhile expos'd upon the Stage.</l>
<l>Let none but <hi>Busie-Bodies</hi> vent their Spight,</l>
<l>And with good Humour Pleasure crown the Night.</l>

<stage>Sir <hi>George Airy</hi> meeting <hi>Charles.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>HA! Sir <hi>George Airy!</hi> A Birding thus early, what forbidden Game rouz'd you so soon? For no lawful Occasion cou'd invite a Person of your Figure abroad at such unfashionable Hours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>There are some Men, <hi>Charles,</hi> whom Fortune has left free from Inquietudes, who are diligently studious to find out Ways and Means to make themselves uneasie.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible that any thing in Nature can ruffle the Temper of a Man, whom the four Seasons of the Year compliment with as many thousand Pounds, nay! and a Father at Rest with his Ancestors.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Why there 'tis now! a Man that wants Money thinks none can be unhappy that has it; but my Affairs are in such a whimsical Posture, that it will require a Calculation of my Nativity to find if my Gold will relieve me or not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, never consult the Stars about that; Gold has a Power beyond them; Gold unlocks the Midnight Councils; Gold out-does the Wind, becalms the Ship, or fills her Sails; Gold is omnipotent below; it makes whole Armies fight, or fly; it buys even Souls, and bribes the Wretches to
<pb n="2" facs="9"/>
betray their Country: Then what can thy Business be, that Gold won't serve thee in?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Why, I'm in Love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>In Love!—Ha, ha, ha, ha; In Love, Ha, ha, ha, with what, prithee, a <hi>Cherubin?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>No, with a Woman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>A Woman, Good, Ha, ha, ha, and Gold not help thee?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>But suppose I'm in Love with two—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Ay, if thou'rt in Love with two hundred, Gold will fetch 'em, I warrant thee, Boy. But who are they? who are they? come.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>One is a Lady whose Face I never saw, but witty as an Angel; the other beautiful as <hi>Venus—</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>And a Fool—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>For ought I know, for I never spoke to her, but you can inform me; I am charm'd by the Wit of One, and dye for the Beauty of the Other?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>And pray, which are you in Quest of now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>I prefer the Sensual Pleasure, I'm for her I've seen, who is thy Father's Ward, <hi>Miranda.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Nay, then I pity you; for the Jew my Father will no more part with her, and 30000 Pound, than he wou'd with a Guinea to keep me from starving.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Now you see Gold can't do every thing, <hi>Charles.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Yes, for 'tis her Gold that bars my Father's Gate against you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Why, if he is this avaricious Wretch, how cam'st thou by such a liberal Education?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Not a Souse out of his Pocket, I assure you? I had an Uncle who defray'd that Charge, but for some little Wildnesses of Youth, tho' he made me his Heir, left Dad my Guardian till I came to Years of Discretion, which I presume the old Gentleman will never think I am; and now he has got the Estate into his Clutches, it does me no more good, than if it lay in <hi>Prester John</hi>'s Dominions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>What can'st thou find no Stratagem to redeem it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>I have made many Essays to no purpose; tho' Want, the Mistress of Invention, still tempts me on, yet still the old Fox is too cunning for me—I am upon my last Project, which if it fails, then for my last Refuge, a Brown Musquet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>What is't, can I assist thee?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Not yet, when you can, I have Confidence enough in you to ask it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>I am always ready, but what do's he intend to do with <hi>Miranda?</hi> Is she to be sold in private? or will he put her up by way of Auction, at who bids most? If so, Egad, I'm for him; my Gold, as you say, shall be subservient to my Pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>To deal ingenuously with you, Sir <hi>George,</hi> I know very little of Her, or Home; for since my Uncle's Death, and my Return from Travel, I have never been well with my Father; he thinks my Expences too great, and I his Allowance too little; he never sees me, but he quarrels; and to avoid that, I shun his House as much as possible. The Report is, he intends to marry her himself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Can she consent to it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Yes faith, so they say; but I tell you, I am wholly ignorant of the matter. <hi>Miranda</hi> and I are like two violent Members of a contrary Party; I can scarce allow her Beauty, tho' all the World do's; nor she me Civility, for that Contempt: I fancy she plays the Mother-in-law already, and sets the old Gentleman on to do mischief.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Then I've your free Consent to get her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Ay and my helping-hand, if occasion be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Pugh, yonder's a Fool coming this way, let's avoid him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>What <hi>Marplot,</hi> no no, he's my Instrument; there's a thousand Conveniencies in him, he'll lend me his Money when he has any, run of my Errands and be proud on't; in short, he'll Pimp for me, Lye, for me, Drink for me, do any thing but fight for me, and that I trust to my own Arm for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Nay then he's to be endur'd; I never knew his Qualifications before.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="4" facs="11"/>Enter <hi>Marplot</hi> with a Patch cross his Face.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Dear <hi>Charles,</hi> your's,—Ha! Sir <hi>George Airy,</hi> the Man in the World, I have an Ambition to be known to
<stage>(aside.)</stage>
Give me thy Hand, dear Boy—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>A good Assurance! But hark ye, how came your Beautiful Countenance clouded in the wrong place?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>I must confess 'tis a little <hi>Mal-a-propos,</hi> but no matter for that; a Word with you, <hi>Charles;</hi> Prithee, introduce me to Sir <hi>George—</hi>he is a Man of Wit, and I'd give ten Guineas to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>When you have 'em you mean.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Ay, when I have 'em; pugh, pox, you cut the Thread of my Discourse—I wou'd give ten Guineas, I say, to be rank'd in his Acquaintance: Well, 'tis a vast Addition to a Man's Fortune, according to the Rout of the World, to be seen in the Company of Leading Men; for then we are all thought to be Politicians, or Whigs, or Jacks, or High-Flyers, or Low-Flyers, or Levellers—and so forth; for you must know, we all herd in Parties now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Then a Fool for Diversion is out of Fashion, I find.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Yes, without it be a mimicking Fool, and they are Darlings every where; but prithee introduce me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Well, on Condition you'll give us a true Account how you came by that Mourning Nose, I will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>I'll do it.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> here's a Gentleman has a passionate Desire to kiss your Hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I honour Men of the Sword; and I presume this Gentleman is lately come from <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Portugal—</hi>by his Scars.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>No really, Sir <hi>George,</hi> mine sprung from civil Fury, happening last Night into the Groom-Porters—I had a strong Inclination to go ten Guineas with a sort of a, sort of a—kind of a Milk Sop, as I thought: A Pox of the Dice, he flung out, and my Pockets being empty, as <hi>Charles</hi>
<pb n="5" facs="12"/>
knows they sometimes are, he prov'd a surly <hi>North-Britain,</hi> and broke my Face for my Deficiency.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! and did not you draw?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Draw, Sir, why, I did but lay my Hand upon my Sword to make a swift Retreat, and he roar'd out. Now the Deel a Ma sol, Sir, gin ye touch yer Steel, Ise whip mine through yer Wem.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, safe was the Word, so you walk'd off, I suppose</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Yes, for I avoid fighting, purely to be serviceable to my Friends you know—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Your Friends are much oblig'd to you, Sir, I hope you'll rank me in that Number.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> a Bow from the side Box, or to be seen in your Chariot, binds me ever yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Trifles, you may command 'em when you please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Provided he may command you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Me! why I live for no other purpose—Sir <hi>George,</hi> I have the Honour to be caress'd by most of the reigning Toasts of the Town, I'll tell 'em you are the finest Gentleman—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>No, no, prithee let me alone to tell the Ladies—my Parts—can you convey a Letter upon Occasion, or deliver a Message with an Air of Business, Ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>With the Assurance of a Page and the Gravity of a Statesman.</p>

<p>What, my Sister <hi>Ward?</hi> Why, her Guardian is mine, we are Fellow Sufferers: Ah! he is a covetous, cheating, sanctify'd Curmudgeon; that Sir <hi>Francis Gripe</hi> is a damn'd old—</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>I ask your Pardon, <hi>Charles,</hi> but it is for your sake I hate him. Well, I say, the World is mistaken in him, his Out side Piety, makes him every Man's Executor, and his Inside Cunning, makes him every Heir's Jaylor. Egad, <hi>Charles,</hi> I'm half persuaded that thou'rt some <hi>Ward</hi> too, and never of

<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>A pleasant Fellow.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>The Dog is Diverting sometimes, or there wou'd be no enduring his Impertinence: He is pressing to be employ'd and willing to execute, but some ill Fate generally attends all he undertakes, and he oftner spoils an Intreague than helps it—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>If I miscarry 'tis none of my Fault, I follow my Instructions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Yes, witness the Merchant's Wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Pish, Pox, that was an Accident.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>What was it, prithee?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Why, you must know, I had lent a certain Merchant my hunting Horses, and was to have met his Wife in his Absence: Sending him alone with my Groom to make the Complement, and to deliver a Letter to the Lady at the same time; what does he do, but gives the Husband the Letter, and offers her the Horses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>I remember you was even with me, for you deny'd the Letter to be yours, and swore I had a design upon her, which my Bones paid for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Come, Sir <hi>George,</hi> let's walk round, if you are not ingag'd, for I have sent my Man upon a little earnest Business, and I have order'd him to bring me the Answer into the Park.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Business, and I not know it, Egad I'll watch him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>I must beg your Pardon, <hi>Charles,</hi> I am to meet your Father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>My Father!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Aye! and about the oddest Bargain perhaps you ever heard of; but I'll not impart till I know the Success.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>What can his Business be with Sir <hi>Francis?</hi> Now would I give all the World to know it; why the Devil should not one know every Man's Concern. <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Prosperity to't whate'er it be, I have private Affairs too; over a Bottle we'll compare Notes.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p><hi>Charles</hi> knows I love a Glass as well as any Man, I'll make one; shall it be to Night? Ad I long to know their Secrets. <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Whisper.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Whis.</speaker>
<p>Sir, Sir, Mrs. <hi>Patch</hi> says <hi>Isabinda</hi>'s Spanish Father has quite spoil'd the Plot, and she can't meet you in the Park, but he infallibly will go out this Afternoon, she says; but I must step again to know the Hour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>What did <hi>Whisper</hi> say now? I shall go stark mad, if I'm not let into this Secret. <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>Curst Misfortune, come along with me, my Heart feels Pleasure at her Name. Sir <hi>George,</hi> yours; we'll meet at the old Place the usual Hour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Agreed; I think I see Sir <hi>Francis</hi> yonder. </p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Coming out of a Chair.)</stage> Let the Chair wait: My Servant, that dog'd Sir <hi>George,</hi> said he was in the Park.</p>
<stage>Enter <hi>Patch.</hi></stage>
<p>Ha! Mis <hi>Patch</hi> alone! did not you tell me you had contriv'd a way to bring <hi>Isabinda</hi> to the Park?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Madam, your Ladiship can't imagine what a wretched Disappointment we have met with: Just as I had fetch'd a Suit of my Cloaths for a Disguise, comes my old Master into his Closet, which is right against her Chamber-Door; this struck us into a terrible Fright—At length I put on a grave Face, and ask'd him if he was at leisure for his Chocolate, in hopes to draw him out of his Hole; but he snap'd my Nose off; No, I shall be busie here this two Hours; at which my poor Mistress seeing no way of Escape, order'd me to wait on your Ladiship with the sad Relation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Unhappy <hi>Isabinda!</hi> Was ever any thing so unaccountable as the Humour of Sir <hi>Jealousie Traffick.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Madam, it's his living so long in <hi>Spain,</hi> he vows he'll spend half his Estate, but he'll be a Parliament-Man, on purpose to bring in a Bill for Women to wear Veils, and the other odious <hi>Spanish</hi> Customs—He swears it is the height of Impudence to have a Woman seen bare-fac'd even at Church, and scarce believes there's a true begotten Child in the City.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, how the old Fool torments himself! Suppose he could introduce his rigid Rules—does he think we could not match them in Contrivance? No, no; Let the Tyrant Man make what Laws he will, if there's a Woman under the Government, I warrant she finds a way to break 'em: Is his Mind set upon the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for his Son-in-law still?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>Ay, and he expects him by the next Fleet, which drives his Daughter to Melancholy and Despair: But, Madam, I find you retain the same gay, cheerful Spirit you had, when I waited on your Ladiship.—My Lady is mighty good humour'd too; and I have found a way to make Sir <hi>Jealousie</hi> believe I am wholly in his Interest, when my real Design is to serve her; he makes me her Jaylor, and I set her at Liberty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>I knew thy Prolifick Brain wou'd be of singular Service to her, or I had not parted with thee to her Father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>But, Madam, the Report is that you are going to marry your Guardian.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>It is necessary such a Report shou'd be, <hi>Patch.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>But is it true, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>That's not absolutely necessary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>I thought it was only the old strain, coaxing him still for your own, and railing at all the young Fellows about Town: In my Mind, now, you are as ill plagu'd with your Guardian, Madam, as my Lady is with her Father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>No, I have Liberty, Wench, that she wants; what would she give now to be in this <hi>dissabilee,</hi> in the—open Air, nay more, in pursuit of the young Fellow she likes, for that's my Case, I assure thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>As for that, Madam, she's even with you; for tho'
<pb n="9" facs="16"/>
she can't come abroad, we have a way to bring him home in spight of old <hi>Argus.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Now <hi>Patch,</hi> your Opinion of my Choice, for here he comes—Ha! my Guardian with him; what can be the meaning of this? I'm sure Sir <hi>Francis</hi> can't know me in this Dress—Let's observe 'em.</p>
<stage>(They withdraw.</stage>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Sir <hi>Francis Gripe</hi> and Sir <hi>George Airy.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Verily, Sir <hi>George,</hi> thou wilt repent throwing away thy Money so, for I tell thee sincerely, <hi>Miranda,</hi> my Charge do's not love a young Fellow, they are all vicious, and seldom make good Husbands; in sober Sadness she cannot abide 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Peeping.)</stage> In sober Sadness you are mistaken—what can this mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Look ye, Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> whether she can or cannot abide young Fellows is not the Business; will you take the fifty Guineas?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>In good truth—I will not, for I knew thy Father, he was a hearty wary Man, and I cannot consent that his Son should squander away what he sav'd, to no purpose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mirand.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Peeping.)</stage> Now, in the Name of Wonder, what Bargain can he be driving about me for fifty Guineas?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>I wish it ben't for the first Nights Lodging, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> since you are so conscientious for my Father's sake, then permit me the Favour, <hi>Gratis.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Peeping.)</stage> The Favour! O' my Life, I believe 'tis as you said, <hi>Patch.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>No verily, if thou dost not buy thy Experience, thou wilt never be wise; therefore give me a Hundred and try Fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>The Scruples arose, I find, from the scanty Sum—Let me see—a Hundred Guineas—
<stage>(Takes 'em out of a Purse and chinks 'em.)</stage>
Ha! they have a very pretty Sound, and a very pleasing Look—But then, <hi>Miranda—</hi>But if she should be cruel—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Peeping.)</stage> As Ten to One I shall—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="17"/>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Ay, do consider on't, He, he, he, he.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>No, I'll do't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>Do't, what, whether you will or no, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Come to the Point, here's the Gold, sum up the Condition—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<stage>(Pulling out a Paper.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Peeping.)</stage> Ay for Heaven's sake do, for my Expectation is on the Rack.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Well at your own Peril be it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Aye, aye, go on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p><hi>Imprimis,</hi> you are to be admitted into my House in order to move your Suit to <hi>Miranda,</hi> for the space of Ten Minutes, without Lett or Molestation, provided I remain in the same Room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>But out of Ear shot—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, I don't desire to hear what yousay, Ha, ha, ha, in consideration I am to have that Purse and a hundred Guineas.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Take it<hi>—Gives him the Purse,</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p> <stage>(Peeping.)</stage> So, 'tis well it's no worse, I'll fit you both—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>And this Agreement is to be perform'd to Day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Aye, aye, the sooner the better, poor Fool, how <hi>Miranda</hi> and I shall laugh at him—Well, Sir <hi>George,</hi> Ha, ha, ha, take the last sound of your Guineas, Ha, ha, ha. <stage>(Chinks 'em.)</stage></p>
<stage>(Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Peeping.)</stage> Sure he does not know I am <hi>Miranda.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>A very extraordinary Bargain I have made truly, if she should be really in Love with this old Cuff now—Psha, that's morally impossible—but then what hopes have I to succeed, I never spoke to her—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Peeping.)</stage> Say you so? Then I am safe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>What tho' my Tongue never spoke, my Eyes said a thousand Things, and my Hopes flatter'd me hers answer'd 'em. If I'm lucky—if not, 'tis but a hundred Guineas thrown away.</p>
<stage>(<hi>Miranda</hi> and <hi>Patch</hi> come forwards.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Upon what Sir <hi>George?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="18"/>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Ha! my <hi>Incognito—</hi>upon a Woman, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>They are the worst things you can deal in, and damage the soonest; your very Breath destroys 'em, and I fear you'll never see your Return, Sir <hi>George,</hi> Ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Were they more brittle than <hi>China,</hi> and drop'd to pieces with a Touch, every Atom of her I have ventur'd at if she is but Mistress of thy Wit, balances Ten times the Sum—Prithee let me see thy Face.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>By no means, that may spoil your Opinion of my Sense—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Rather confirm it, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>So rob the Lady of your Gallantry, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>No Child, a Dish of Chocolate in the Morning never spoils my Dinner; the other Lady, I design a set Meal; so there's no danger—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Matrimony! Ha, ha, ha; what Crimes have you committed against the God of Love, that he should revenge 'em so severely to stamp Husband upon your Forehead—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>For my Folly in having so often met you here, without pursuing the Laws of Nature, and exercising her command—But I resolve e'er we part now, to know who you are, where you live, and what kind of Flesh and Blood your Face is; therefore unmask and don't put me to the trouble of doing it for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>My Face is the same Flesh and Blood with my Hand, Sir <hi>George,</hi> which if you'll be so rude to provoke.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>You'll apply it to my Cheek—The Ladies Favours are always Welcome; but I must have that Cloud withdrawn.
<stage>(Taking hold of her)</stage>
Remember you are in the <hi>Park,</hi> Child, and what a terrible thing would it be to lose this pretty white Hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>And how will it sound in a <hi>Chocolate-House;</hi> that Sir <hi>George Airy</hi> rudely pull'd off a Ladies Mask, when he had given her his Honour, that he never would, directly or indirectly endeavour to know her till she gave him Leave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>I wish we were safe out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>But if that Lady thinks fit to pursue and meet me at every turn like some troubled Spirit, shall I be blam'd
<pb n="12" facs="19"/>
if I inquire into the Reality? I would have nothing dissatisfy'd in a Female Shape.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>What shall I do? <stage>(Pause.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Ay, prithee consider, for thou shalt find me very much at thy Service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Batch.</speaker>
<p>Suppose, Sir, the Lady should be in Love with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I'll return the Obligation in a Moment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>And marry her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, that's not the way to love her, Child.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>If he discovers me I shall die—Which way shall I escape?—Let me see. <stage>(Pauses.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Well, Madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>I have it—Sir <hi>George,</hi> 'tis fit you should allow something; if you'll excuse my Face, and turn your Back (if you look upon me I shall sink, even mask'd as I am) I will confess why I have engaged you so often, who I am, and where I live?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Well, to shew you I'm a Man of Honour I accept the Conditions. Let me but once know those, and the Face won't be long a Secret to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>What mean you, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>To get off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>'Tis something indecent to turn ones Back upon a Lady; but you command and I obey. <stage>(Turns his Back.)</stage> Come, Madam, begin—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>First then it was my unhappy Lot to see you at <hi>Paris.</hi>
<stage>(Draws back a little while and speaks)</stage>
at a Ball upon a Birth-day; your Shape and Air charm'd my Eyes; your Wit and Complaisance my Soul, and from that fatal Night I lov'd you.
<stage>(Drawing back.)</stage>
And when you left the Place, Grief seiz'd me so—No Rest my Heart, no Sleep my Eyes cou'd know.—</p>
<l><hi>Last I resolv'd a hazardous Point to try,</hi></l>
<l><hi>And quit the Place in search of Liberty.</hi></l>
<stage>(Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="20"/>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Excellent—I hope she's Handsome—Well, Now, Madam, to the other two Things: Your Name, and where you live?—I am a Gentleman, and this Confession will not be lost upon me.—Nay, prithee don't weep, but go on—for I find my Heart melts in thy Behalf—speak quickly or I shall turn about—Not yet.—Poor Lady, she expects I shou'd comfort her; and to do her Justice, she has said enough to encourage me.
<stage>(Turns about.)</stage>
Ha? gone! The Devil, jilted? Why, what a Tale has she invented—of <hi>Paris,</hi> Balls, and Birth-Days.—Egad I'd give Ten Guineas to know who this Gipsie is.—A Curse of my Folly—I deserve to lose her; what Woman can forgive a Man that turns his Back.</p>
<l><hi>The Bold and Resolute, in Love and War,</hi></l>
<l><hi>To Conquer take the Right, and swiftest Way;</hi></l>
<l><hi>The boldest Lover soonest gains the Fair,</hi></l>
<l><hi>As Courage makes the rudest Force obey,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Take no denial, and the Dames adore ye,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Closely pursue them and they fall before ye.</hi></l>

<p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha; Oh, I shall die with Laughing.—The most Romantick Adventure: Ha, ha! What does the odious young Fop mean? A Hundred Pieces to talk an Hour with me; Ha, ha.</p>

<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>And I am to be by too; there's the Jest: Adod, if it had been in Private, I shou'd not have car'd to trust the young dog.</p>

<speaker>Mirand.</speaker>
<p>Indeed and Indeed, but you might <hi>Gardy—</hi>Now methinks there's no Body Handsomer than you: So Neat, so Clean, so Good-Humour'd, and so Loving.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Pritty Rogue, Pritty Rogue, and so thou shalt find me, if thou do'st prefer thy <hi>Gardy</hi> before these Caperers of the Age, thou shalt out-shine the Queen's Box on an <hi>Opera</hi> Night; thou shalt be the Envy of the Ring (for I will carry thee to <hi>Hide-Park</hi>) and thy Equipage shall Surpass, the what—d'ye call 'em Ambassadors.</p>

<p>Nay, I'm sure the Discreet Part of my Sex will Envy me more for the Inside Furniture, when you are in it, than my Outside Equipage.</p>

<p>A Cunning Baggage, a faith thou art, and a wise one too; and to shew thee thou hast not chose amiss, I'll this moment disinherit my Son, and Settle my whole Estate upon thee.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>There's and old Rogue now:
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
No, <hi>Gardy,</hi> I would not have your Name be so Black in the World—You know my Father's Will runs, that I am not to possess my Estate, without your Consent, till I'm Five and Twenty; you shall only abate the odd Seven Years, and make me Mistress of my Estate to Day, and I'll make you Master of my Person to Morrow.</p>

<p>Sir, your Necessities are very Impertinent, and ought to have sent before they Entred.</p>

<p>Sir, I knew 'twas a Word wou'd gain Admittance no where.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Then, Sirrah, how durst you Rudely thrust that upon your Father, which no Body else wou'd admit?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="23"/>
<speaker>Char.</speaker>
<p>Sure the Name of a Son is a sufficient Plea. I ask this Lady's Pardon if I have intruded.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Ay, ask her Pardon and her Blessing too, if you expect any thing from me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>I believe yours, Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> in a Purse of Guinea's wou'd be more material. Your Son may have Business with you, I'll retire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>I guess his Business, but I'll dispatch him; I expect the Knight every Minute: You'll be in Readiness.</p>

<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>And what's that to me, Sir: Your Management shou'd have made them better.</p>

<p>If you please to intrust me with the Management of my Estate, I shall endeavour it, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>What to set upon a Card, and buy a Lady's Favour at the Price of a Thousand Pieces, to rig out an Equipage for a Wench, or by your carelessness enrich your Steward to fine for Sheriff, or put up for Parliament-Man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Char.</speaker>
<p>I hope I shou'd not spend it this way: However, I ask only for what my Uncle left me; Your's you may dispose of as you please, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>That I shall, out of your Reach, I assure you, Sir. Adod these young Fellows think old Men get Estates for nothing but them to squander away, in Dicing, Wenching, Drinking, Dressing, and so forth.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>You have hit it, Guardian—I want a Hundred Pound.</p>

<p>My Lady <hi>Wrinkle,</hi> worth Forty Thousand Pound, sets up for a Handsome young Husband; she prais'd thee t'other Day; tho' the Match-makers can get Twenty Guinea's for a sight of her, I can introduce thee for nothing.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, I think it is too much; a young Beautiful Woman with half the Money wou'd be more agreeable. I thank you, Sir, but you chose better for your self, I find.</p>

<p>Madam, whether you'll Excuse or Blame my Love the Author of this rash Proceeding depends upon your Pleasure, as also the Life of your Admirer; your

<p>Shake off this Tyrant <hi>Guardian</hi>'s Yoke, assume your self, and dash his bold aspiring Hopes; the Deity of his Desires, is Avarice; a Heretick in Love, and ought to be bananish'd by the Queen of Beauty.

View me well, am I not a proper Handsome Fellow, ha? Can you prefer that old, dry, wither'd, sapless Log of Sixty-five, to the vigorous, gay, sprightly Love of Twenty-four?

This single Hour cost me a hundred Pound—and wou'd you answer me, I could purchase the 24 so: However, Madam, you must give me leave to make the best Interpretation I can for my Money, and take the Indication of your silence for the secret Liking of my Person: Therefore, Madam, I will instruct you how to keep your Word inviolate to Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> and yet answer me to every Question: As for Example, When I ask any thing to which you would reply in the Affirmative, gently Nod your Head—thus; and when in the Negative, thus;

Pardon the bluntness of my Questions, for my Time is short; may I not hope to supplant him in your Esteem?
<stage>(<hi>Miran.</hi> Sighs.)</stage>
Good; she answers me as I could wish—You'll not consent to marry him then?
<stage>(<hi>Miran.</hi> Sighs)</stage>
How, doubtful in that—Undone again—Humph! but that may proceed from his Power to keep her out of her Estate till Twenty-five; I'll try that—Come, Madam, I cannot think you hesitate on this Affair out of any Motive but your Fortune—Let him keep it till those few Years are expir'd; make me happy with your Person, let him enjoy your Wealth—
<stage>(<hi>Miran.</hi> holds up her Hands.)</stage>
Why,

what Sign is that now? Nay, nay, Madam, except you observe my Lesson, I can't understand your meaning—</p>

What! does she mean she won't answer me to the Purpose, or is she afraid yon' old Cuff shou'd understand her Signs?—Aye, it must be that, I perceive Madam, you are too apprehensive of the Promise you have made to follow my Rules; therefore I'll suppose your Mind and answer for you—First, for my self, Madam, that I am in Love with you is an infallible Truth. Now for you:
<stage>(Turns on her side.)</stage>
Indeed, Sir, and may I believe it—As certainly, Madam, as that 'tis Day-light, or that I Die if you persist in Silence—Bless me with the Musick of your Voice, and raise my Spirits to their proper Heaven: Thus low let me intreat; e'er I'm oblig'd to quit this Place, grant me some Token of a favourable Reception to keep my Hopes alive.
<stage>(Arises hastily turns of her side.)</stage>

<p>Say you so, Mistress; who the Devil taught you the Art of Reasoning? I assure you, they must have a greater Faith than I pretend to, that can think any Woman innocent who requires Liberty. Therefore, <hi>Patch,</hi> to your Charge I give her; Lock her up till I come back from <hi>Change:</hi> I shall have some sauntring Coxcomb, with nothing but a Red Coat and a Feather, think, by Leaping into her Arms, to Leap into my Estate—But I'll prevent them; she shall be only Signeur <hi>Babinetto</hi>'s.</p>

<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>Really, Sir, I wish you wou'd employ any Body else in this Affair; I lead a Life like a Dog with obeying your Commands. Come, Madam, will you please to be Lock'd up.</p>

<p>I believe this Wench is very true to my Interest: I am happy I met with her, if I can but keep my Daughter from being blown upon till Signeur <hi>Babinetto</hi> arrives; who shall marry her as soon as he comes, and carry her to <hi>Spain</hi> as soon as he has married her; she has a pregnant Wit, and I'd no more have her an <hi>English</hi> Wife, than the Grand Signior's Mistress. <stage>(Exit.</stage></p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha, a Whim indeed! why is it not Demonstration I give my Leave when I marry thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Not for your Reputation, <hi>Gardee;</hi> the malicious World will be apt to say, you trick'd me into Marriage, and so take the Merit from my Choice. Now I will have the Act my own, to let the idle Fops see how much I prefer a Man loaded with Years and Wisdom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Humph! Prithee leave out Years, <hi>Chargee,</hi> I'm not so old, as thou shalt find: Adod, I'm young; there's a Caper for ye. <stage>(Jumps.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Oh never excuse it, why I like you the better for being old—But I shall suspect you don't love me, if you Refuse me this Formality.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Not Love thee, <hi>Chargee!</hi> Adod I do love thee better than, than, than, better than—what shall I say? Egad, better than Money, I faith I do—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>That's false I'm sure
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
To prove it'do this then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Well, I will do it, <hi>Chargee,</hi> provided I bring a License at the same time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Ay, and a Parson too, if you please; Ha, ha, ha, I can't help Laughing to think how all the young Coxcombs about Town will be mortify'd when they hear of our Marriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>So they will, so they will; Ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Well, I fancy I shall be so happy with my <hi>Gardee!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>If wearing Pearls and Jewels, or eating Gold, as the old Saying is, can make thee happy, thou shalt be so, my Sweetest, my Lovely, my Charming, my—verily I know not what to call thee,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>You must know, <hi>Gardee,</hi> that I am so eager to have this Business concluded, that I have employ'd my Womans Brother, who is a Lawyer in the <hi>Temple,</hi> to settle Matters
<pb n="36" facs="43"/>
just to your Liking, you are to give your Consent to my Marriage, which is to your self you know: But Mum, you must take no notice of that. So then I will, that is, with your Leave, put my Writings into his Hands; then to Morrow we come slap upon them with a Wedding that no body thought on; by which you seize me and my Estate, and I suppose make a Bonfire of your own Act and Deed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Nay, but <hi>Chargee,</hi> if—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Nay, <hi>Gardee,</hi> no Ifs—Have I refus'd three <hi>Northern</hi> Lords, two <hi>British</hi> Peers, and half a score Knights, to have you put in your Ifs?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>So thou hast indeed, and I will trust to thy Management. Od, I'm all of a Fire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a wonder the dry Stubble does not blaze.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Marplot.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>How now! who sent for you, Sir? What's the Hundred Pound gone already?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, I don't want Money now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>No; that's a Miracle! But there's one thing you want, I'm sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Ay, what's that, <hi>Guardian?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Manners; what, had I no Servants without?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>None that cou'd do my Business, <hi>Guardian,</hi> which is at present with this Lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>With me, Mr. <hi>Marplot!</hi> what is it, I beseech you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir, what is it? any thing that relates to her may be deliver'd to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>I deny that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>That's more than I do, Sir:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Madam; why then to proceed: Fame says that you and my most conscionable <hi>Guardian</hi> here design'd, contriv'd, plotted and agreed, to chouse a very civil, honourable, honest Gentleman, out of a Hundred Pound.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>That I contriv'd it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Ay you—You said never a Word against it, so far you are Guilty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Pray tell that civil, honourable, honest Gentleman,
<pb n="37" facs="44"/>
that if he has any more such Sums to fool away, they shall be received like the last; Ha, ha, ha, ha, chous'd, quotha! But hark ye, let him know at the same time, that if he dare to report I trick'd him of it, I shall recommend a Lawyer to him shall shew him a Trick for twice as much; D'ye hear? Tell him that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>So, and this is the way you use a Gentleman, and my Friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Is the Wretch thy Friend?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>The Wretch! Look ye, Madam, don't call Names; Egad I won't take it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Why you won't beat me, will you? Ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>I don't know whether I will or no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I shall make a Servant shew you out at the Window, if you are sawcy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>I am your most humble Servant, <hi>Guardian;</hi> I design to go out the same way I came in. I wou'd only ask this Lady, if she do's not think in her Soul Sir <hi>George Airy</hi> is not a fine Gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>He dresses well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Which is chiefly owing to his Taylor, and <hi>Valet de Chambre.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>And if you allow that a Proof of his being a fine Gentleman, he is so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>The judicious part of the World allow him Wit, Courage, Gallantry and Management; tho' I think he sorfeited that Character, when he flung away a hundred Pound upon your dumb Ladiship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Does that gaul him? Ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>So Sir <hi>George</hi> remaining in deep Discontent, has sent you his trusty Squire to utter his Complaint: Ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Madam; and you, like a cruel, hard-hearted <hi>Jew,</hi> value it no more—than I wou'd your Ladiship, were I Sir <hi>George,</hi> you, you, you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Oh, don't call Names. I know you love to be employ'd, and I'll oblige you, and you shall carry him a Message from me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="38" facs="45"/>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>According as I like it: What is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Nay, a kind one you may be sure—First tell him, I have chose this Gentleman to have, and to hold, and so forth. <stage>(Clapping her Hand into Sir <hi>Francis</hi>'s</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Oh the dear Rogue, how I dote on her! <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>And advise his Impertinence to trouble me no more, for I prefer Sir <hi>Francis</hi> for a Husband before all the Fops in the Universe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Oh Lord, O Lord! She's bewitch'd, that's certain; Here's a Husband for Eighteen—Here's a Shape—Here's Bones ratling in a Leathern Bag.
<stage>(Turning Sir <hi>Francis</hi> about.)</stage>
Here's Buckrum and Canvass, to scrub you to Repentance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tran.</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, my Cane shall teach you Repentance presently.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>No faith, I have felt its Twin-brother from just such a wither'd Hand too lately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>One thing more, advise him to keep from the Garden Gate on the left Hand; for if he dare to saunter there, about the Hour of Eight, as he used to do, he shall be saluted with a Pistol or a Blunderbuss.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>O monstrous! why <hi>Chargee;</hi> did he use to come to the Garden Gate?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>The Gardner describ'd just such another Man that always watch'd his coming out, and fain wou'd have brib'd him for his Entrance—Tell him he shall find a warm Reception if he comes this Night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Pistols and Blunderbusses! Egad, a warm Reception indeed; I shall take care to inform him of your Kindness, and advise him to keep farther off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>I hope he will understand my meaning better, than to follow your Advice. <stage>(Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Thou hast sign'd, seal'd, and ta'en Possession of my Heart, for ever, <hi>Chargee,</hi> Ha, ha, ha; and for you, Mr. Sauce-box, let me have no more of your Messages, if ever you design to inherit your Estate, Gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marpl.</speaker>
<p>Why there 'tis now. Sure I shall be out of your Clutches one Day.—Well, <hi>Guardian,</hi> I say no more; but if you be not as errant a Cuckold, as e'er drove Bargain upon
<pb n="39" facs="46"/>
the Exchange, or paid Attendance to a Court, I am the Son of a Whetstone; and so your humble Servant. </p>

<p>And then—Adod, I believe I am Metamorphos'd; my Pulse beats high, and my Blood boils, methinks— <stage>(Kissing and Hugging her.</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Oh fye, <hi>Gardee,</hi> be not so violent; Consider the Market lasts all the Year—Well, I'll in and see if the Lawyer be come, you'll follow. </p>
<stage>(Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Ay, to the World's End, my Dear. Well, <hi>Frank,</hi> thou art a lucky Fellow in thy old Age, to have such a delicate Morsel, and Thirty Thousand Pound in love with thee; I shall be the Envy of Batchelors, the Glory of Marry'd Men, and the Wonder of the Town.

<p>My Lady imagin'd so, and by her Orders I have been scouting this Hour in search of you, to inform you that Sir <hi>Jealous</hi> has invited some Friends to Supper with him to Night, which gives an Opportunity to your Master to make use of his Ladder of Ropes: The Closet Window shall be open, and <hi>Isabinda</hi> ready to receive him; bid him come immediately.</p>

<p>Pho, 'tis no Language, but a Character which the Lovers invented to avert Discovery.

<p>He wants the Eyes of <hi>Argus,</hi> that has a young handsome Daughter in this Town, but my Comfort is, I shall not be troubl'd long with her. He that pretends to rule a Girl once in her Teens, had better be at Sea in a Storm, and would be in less Danger.</p>

<p>Are you sure, no Body saw you speak to <hi>Whisper?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>Yes, very sure Madam, but I heard Sir <hi>Jealous</hi> coming down Stairs, so I clapt this Letter into my Pocket. <stage>(feels for the Letter.</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>
<p>A Letter! give it me quickly.</p>

<p>Is it possible, thou could'st be so careless—Oh! I'm undone for ever if it be lost.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>I must have drop'd it upon the Stairs. But why are you so much alarm'd, if the worst happens no body can read it, Madam, nor find out whom it was design'd for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Isab.</speaker>

<p>Why, Sir, it is a Charm for the Tooth-ach—I have worn it this seven Year, 'twas given me by an Angel for ought I know, when I was raving with the Pain; for no body knew from whence he came, nor whither he went, he charg'd me never to open it, lest some dire Vengeance befal me, and Heaven knows what will be the Event.

<p>I would not lose <hi>Patch</hi> for the World—I'll take courage a little.

<p>Whoever the Dog were he has escap'd out of the Window, for the Sash is up.

<p>What have I done, Sir, to merit your Displeasure?</p>

<p>I don't know which of you have done it; but you shall both suffer for it, till I can discover whose Guilt it is: Go, get in there, I'll move you from this side of the House
<stage>(Pushes <hi>Isabinda</hi> in at the other Door, and locks it; puts the Key in his Pocket.)</stage>
I'll keep the Key my self: I'll try what Ghost will get into that Room. And now forsooth I'll wait on you down Stairs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Patch.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my poor Lady—Down Stairs, Sir, but I won't go out, Sir, till I have look'd up my Cloaths.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Jeal.</speaker>
<p>If thou wer't as naked as thou wer't born, thou should'st not stay to put on a Smock. Come along, I say; when your Mistress is marry'd you shall have your Rags, and every thing that belongs to you; but till then— <stage>(Exit pulling her out.</stage></p>

<p>I cou'd not go, tho' 'tis upon Life and Death, without taking leave of dear <hi>Chargee.</hi> Besides this Fellow buz'd in my Ears, that thou might'st be so desperate to shoot that wild Rake which haunts the Garden-Gate; and that wou'd bring us into trouble, dear—</p>

<p>So, <hi>Marplot</hi> brought you back then: I am oblig'd to him for that, I'm sure— <stage>(Frowning at <hi>Marplot</hi> aside.</stage></p>

<p>Peace, ye young Knave! Some Forty Years hence I may think on't—But, <hi>Chargee,</hi> I'll be with thee to Morrow, before those pretty Eyes are open; I will, I will, <hi>Chargee,</hi> I'll rouze you, I faith.—Here Mrs. <hi>Scentwell,</hi> lift up your Lady's Chimney-Board, that I may throw my Peel in, and not litter her Chamber.</p>

<p>Hold, hold, hold, dear <hi>Gardee,</hi> I have a, a, a, a, a Monkey shut up there; and if you open it before the Man comes that is to tame it, 'tis so wild 'twill break all my China, or get away, and that wou'd break my Heart; for I am fond on't to distraction, next thee dear <hi>Gardee.</hi> <stage>In a flattering Tone.</stage></p>

<p>For Heaven's sake, dear, Madam, let me but peep, to see if it be as pretty as my Lady <hi>Fiddle-Faddle</hi>'s. Has it got a Chain?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miran.</speaker>
<p>Not yet, but I design it one shall last its Life-time: Nay, you shall not see it—Look, <hi>Gardee,</hi> how he teazes me!</p>

<p>No great harm, I beg of you to forgive me: Longing to see the Monkey, I did but just ràise up the Board, and it flew over my Shoulders, scratch'd all my Face, broke yon' China, and whisk'd out of the Window.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Fran.</speaker>
<p>Was ever such an unlucky Rogue! Sirrah, I forbid you my House. Call the Servants to get the Monkey again; I wou'd stay my self to look it, but that you know my earnest Business.</p>

<p>Why look you, Madam! if I have committed a fault, thank your self; no Man is more Serviceable when I am let into a Secret, nor none more unlucky at finding it out.

<p>How come you employ'd in this Message, Mrs. <hi>Patch?</hi></p>

<p>WELL, <hi>Patch,</hi> I have done a strange bold thing! my Fate is determin'd, and Expectation is no more. Now to avoid the Impertinence and Roguery of an old Man, I have thrown myself into the Extravagance of a young one; if he should despise, slight or use me ill, there's no Remedy from a Husband, but the Grave; and that's a terrible Sanctuary to one of my Age and Constitution.</p>

<p>O fear not, Madam, you'll find your Account in Sir <hi>George Airy;</hi> it is impossible a Man of Sense shou'd use a Woman ill, indued with Beauty, Wit and Fortune.
