<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>TO those who are not conversant in the history of the Asiatic nations, it may not be improper to give in brief, the story upon which the Tragedy of Zingis is founded, as it is taken from the TARICH MOGULISTAN, or History of the Mogul Tartars, written in the Persian language.</p>
<p>In the twelfth century, most of the Tartar Ordas, or tribes, though governed by their own chiefs, paid tribute to the king of the Orda of the Keraits, who held his court under the title of the GRAND CHAN, in the city of Caracorum, well known since by the name of Ordabalich. The famous Zingis Chan, who afterwards conquered all the countries from the sea of Canton in China to the Nile, was prince of the Niron tribe of Tartars; and from his early youth, served in the armies of Aunac, the Grand Chan; and at last rose to the command of all his forces. Zemouca, chief of the Siogarates, supplanted Zingis in Aunac's favor. Zingis was disgraced. He retired to his Orda, which was in some measure independent of the Grand Chan. Aunac pursued Zingis with a small force, and was defeated. In the ensuing year Aunac was, in a pitched battle, totally routed by Zingis; Zangon the prince royal was slain, and the only daughter of Aunac, Ovisa Lugîn, fell into the conqueror's hands. Zingis having determined to give Ovisa in marriage to his favorite son Octar, who afterwards succeeded him in the empire of all Asia, occasioned an insurrection under Timur, another of his sons, who was in love with the princess. Timur fell in his rebellion, Ovisa died of grief, and the unfortunate monarch, Aunac, was killed in his flight, from an action, in which he was defeated by a part of the army of Zingis.</p>
<p>Zingis Chan, whether we regard him as a conqueror or legislator, was, perhaps, the greatest prince, that ever appeared in history. He not only secured the empire of all Asia to his posterity for some ages, but even to
<pb facs="4"/>
this day, two-thirds of that immense continent remains in the possession of princes of his blood. So fortunate was he in his children and descendents, that many of them did not yield in abilities to him; and they would, perhaps, have equalled him in fame, had his sword left them more to conquer.—The Emperor of China, the Mogul of India, the great Chan of Tartary, and the princes of the Krim Tartars, derive their blood from Zingis; and it is remarkable that, at one period, there were five hundred crowned heads of his race in Asia.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE,</head>
<byline>By Mr. HOME,</byline>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. HOLLAND.</stage>
<lg>
<l>TOO much the Greek and Roman chiefs engage</l>
<l>The Muses care,—they languish on our Stage;</l>
<l>The Modern Bard, struck with the vast applause</l>
<l>Of ancient masters, like the painter draws</l>
<l>From models only;—can such copies charm</l>
<l>The heart, or like the glow of nature warm?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>To fill the scene, to night our Author brings</l>
<l>Originals at least,—warriors and kings—</l>
<l>Heroes, who like their gems, unpolish'd shine,</l>
<l>The mighty fathers of the Tartar line;</l>
<l>Greater than those, whom Classic pages boast,</l>
<l>If those are greatest, who have conquer'd most.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Such is the subject—such the Poet's theme,</l>
<l>If a rough Soldier may assume that name;</l>
<l>Who does not offer you from Fancy store,</l>
<l>Manners and men.—On India's burning shore,</l>
<l>In warlike toils, he pass'd his youthful years,</l>
<l>And met the Tartar, in the strife of spears;</l>
<l>But tho' he liv'd amidst the cannons roar,</l>
<l>Thunder like yours he never fac'd before;</l>
<l>Listen indulgent to his artless strain,</l>
<l>Nor let a Soldier, quarter ask in vain.</l>

<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>THE waining moon has set behind the hill,</l>
<l>And the faint twilight of the morning seems</l>
<l>To wander o'er the East.—The storms that long</l>
<l>Have shook the desart, now are pass'd away,</l>
<l>And Altay's stream retards the war no more;</l>
<l>Here Zingis forms the Nirons of the west;</l>
<l>And royal Aunac on the farther shore</l>
<l>Marshals the Naimans, and demands his throne.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>NEVIAN.</speaker>
<l>The emperor of Tartary commands</l>
<l>Thy presence, Cubla.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>Zingis should have cloath'd</l>
<l>His haughty message in less odious terms.</l>
<l>Does he presume to hope that I will join</l>
<l>His rebel sword against his antient lord?</l>
<l>Tho' near ally'd to Zingis—tho' I own</l>
<l>His parts unequal'd—his desert in arms—</l>
<l>Nevian, my soul approves not of the means</l>
<l>By which he seiz'd the scepter of the East;</l>
<l>And drove great Aunac from the Tartar throne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NEVIAN.</speaker>
<l>'Tis less a vassal's duty to approve</l>
<l>Than to obey his sovereign's high commands.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>A vassal! By that honor which descends</l>
<l>From a long line of ancestors to Cubla,</l>
<l>My soul rejects the thought.—What tho' my tribe</l>
<l>In Aunac's wide dominions form'd a state,</l>
<l>And my brave fathers listen'd to the voice</l>
<l>That issu'd from the throne, and rose in arms</l>
<l>When war was in the field;—shall I become</l>
<l>The property of treason—be transferr'd</l>
<l>The mean appendage of a crown usurp'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
<speaker>NEVIAN.</speaker>
<l>Beware of treason—Cubla, can thy tribe,</l>
<l>Bold as thou art, and confident in war,</l>
<l>Contend with him who rules the Eastern world?</l>
<l>Zingis is king—and now that homage claims</l>
<l>Which thou didst pay to the imperial throne.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>Presumptuous man!—does he prescribe to Cubla,</l>
<l>Or talk of homage!—he who broke all ties</l>
<l>That bind the faith of subjects to their kings!</l>
<l>Whence is his right deriv'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NEVIAN.</speaker>
<l>He has been wrong'd—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>Wrong'd didst thou say?—what wrongs can justify</l>
<l>His usurpation.—Should the world permit</l>
<l>Private ambition thus to seize on crowns,</l>
<l>Each daring villain that dispises life</l>
<l>Would be the king or tyrant of mankind.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NEVIAN.</speaker>
<l>Rashly thou dost condemn.—Does Cubla know</l>
<l>The Cause and progress of this bloody war?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>From the chill bosom of the stormy north,</l>
<l>From Corea's distant clime, where I have long</l>
<l>Employ'd my sword against my country's foes;</l>
<l>Last night arriv'd amidst domestic broils,</l>
<l>I know not aught but that my king's dethron'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
<speaker>NEVIAN.</speaker>
<l>The prince of Soigara—the bold Zemouca,</l>
<l>Was the first mover of this civil war.</l>
<l>He, jealous of the fame and deeds of Zingis,</l>
<l>And that high confidence his rival held</l>
<l>With Aunac—to the royal ear convey'd</l>
<l>Malicious falshoods, and intended treason.</l>
<l>At length the monarch list'ning to his voice,</l>
<l>Divested Zingis of his high command.</l>
<l>The chief retired, and darkly pass'd along</l>
<l>To his own native tribe—the hardy Nirons—</l>
<l>They thought him wrong'd—they started to their arms,</l>
<l>Determin'd to defend him from his foes.—</l>
<l>Zemouca came—his host was roll'd away.</l>
<l>The king advanc'd; in Tangut's bloody field,</l>
<l>The valiant Zingis triumph'd o'er his lord.</l>
<l>Amidst his ruin'd armies in the fight</l>
<l>The son of Aunac, graceful Zangon, fell;</l>
<l>Whilst o'er his mangl'd corse his father fled,</l>
<l>And left his capital and throne to Zingis.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>Zemouca was to blame.—'Twas dangerous</l>
<l>To drive a hero to the last extreme.</l>
<l>The very coward, when bereft of hope,</l>
<l>Turns on the lifted sword that threatens death.</l>
<l>But now let Zingis grant his sovereign peace,</l>
<l>And give the nations back to Aunac's sway;</l>
<l>Fame will applaud the deed. He hopes in vain</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="11"/>
The aid of Cubla to support his crimes:</l>
<l>But since my sister was his favourite spouse,</l>
<l>And gave to him a son—the princely Timur;</l>
<l>For Timur's sake I will not join his foes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NEVIAN.</speaker>
<l>'Tis not enough. Inflexible—severe,</l>
<l>Tenacious of his power, and, like a god,</l>
<l>Decisive in his councils—he declares</l>
<l>Himself the foe of temporizing friends.</l>
<l>Consult thy safety.—Know, the Naiman prince</l>
<l>Betrays his sovereign, and sollicits peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>Betrays the king to Zingis!—Tell your lord,</l>
<l>Should he imbrue his hand in Aunac's blood,</l>
<l>Cubla must be his foe.—My safety rests</l>
<l>Upon my sword.—This day I would confer</l>
<l>With Zingis—quickly I will join his camp.</l>
<l>Haste, and convey this answer to your chief.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NEVIAN.</speaker>
<l>It grieves me to behold my former friend</l>
<l>Thus rushing headlong into certain ruin.</l>
<l>Cubla, let me conjure thee—guard thy words,</l>
<l>And talk not thus of Zingis.—He is stern.—</l>
<l>I'll bear a milder answer to the king.</l>

<l>Blame not thy friend, tho' the event of war</l>

<l>Tho' few his friends since fortune left his side,</l>
<l>Tho' scarce his strength his armour can sustain,</l>

<l>He plans a daring purpose in his soul.</l>
<l>He near this place is striding thro' the night,</l>
<l>Like the dark genius of devoted Zingis.</l>
<l>'Tis thine to point his thunder to the mark,</l>
<l>And rouse dishonour'd Timur.—</l>

<l>Ha! dishonour'd—</l>

<l>Whence, then, is this unmeritted disgrace,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZENA.</speaker>
<l>When with his ruin'd armies Aunac fled</l>
<l>From Tangut's bloody field, young Timur press'd</l>

<l>As faint and wounded by a brook he lay,</l>
<l>His grey head leaning on his daughter's breast,</l>
<l>His only child, the beautiful Ovisa.</l>
<l>The hero saw—he pitied, and he lov'd—</l>
<l>Brought the fair captive to the Niron camp,</l>
<l>But gave her father's freedom to her tears;</l>
<l>She in return bestow'd on him her heart.</l>
<l>For this, fierce Zingis from his presence drove</l>
<l>His generous son.—The exil'd Aunac heard</l>
<l>Of his fair daughter's love—her choice approv'd,</l>
<l>And, by an embassy, propos'd to yield</l>
<l>The bright Ovisa to young Timur's arms;</l>
<l>To name him heir of Tartary should Zingis</l>

<l>My lord Zemouca, welcome to my soul!</l>
<l>O chief of the Soigara!—from what a world</l>
<l>Of troubles art thou come!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZEMOUCA.</speaker>
<l>Yes—I have strove</l>
<l>With some disasters, Mila, since the Niron</l>
<l>Led his rebellious tribe to Tangut's field,</l>
<l>And triumph'd o'er his lord. Had loyalty</l>
<l>Been less my choice—Had ease been more my care,</l>
<l>Than self-approving honor, and that pride</l>
<l>Which lov'd to stand alone, when Tartary</l>
<l>Fell in the stream of conquest to a chief,</l>
<l>I once scarce own'd my equal, I might use</l>
<l>The day to visit Mila, and have thrown</l>
<l>This cloud, I borrow, from the night, away.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MILA.</speaker>
<l>How fares it with the king?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZEMOUCA.</speaker>
<l>Not such his state,</l>
<l>As when in Ordu-bâla's splendid halls</l>
<l>He rul'd the nations—On the farther side</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="18"/>
of Altay's foaming course, my tribe surrounds</l>
<l>The king of Tartars—narrow is the camp</l>
<l>Of him, who covered Asia with his hosts!</l>
<l>But still this sun which moves behind a storm,</l>
<l>May issue forth, and shew his evening beams,</l>
<l>Before he sets in night.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MILA.</speaker>
<l>Should Naima's prince</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MILA.</speaker>
<l>Tartary is lost—</l>
<l>The house of Aunac trembles to its base,</l>
<l>And in its ruins will involve Zemouca.</l>
<l>Why dost thou stand, against a world in arms,</l>
<l>With unavailing valor?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZEMOUCA.</speaker>
<l>Hear me, Mila;</l>
<l>Ere next the night shall from these fields retire,</l>
<l>Aunac shall reign o'er Asia. I have form'd</l>
<l>A plot with Zena, in the Niron camp.</l>
<l>Cubia will join us with his warlike tribe.</l>
<l>At the dead midnight hour, we mean to rush</l>
<l>On Zingis in his tent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MILA.</speaker>
<l>To rush on Zingis!</l>
<l>The deed is desperate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="19"/>
<speaker>ZEMOUCA.</speaker>
<l>We claim thine aid</l>
<l>To forward our design. To thee is known</l>
<l>The love of Timur, and his late disgrace</l>
<l>For the escape of Aunac. Thro' their tribes</l>
<l>The Nirons murmur for their gallant prince</l>
<l>Who led them often to the fields of fame.</l>
<l>Go to Ovisa: let her arm the son</l>
<l>Of haughty Zingis in her father's cause.</l>
<l>Thus shall she wrest from tyranny the world,</l>
<l>And rule the nations with the man she loves.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MILA.</speaker>
<l>And does my brother then resign Ovisa?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZEMOUCA.</speaker>
<l>No—Mila, no.—She beams upon me still,</l>
<l>Thro' all this tempest which involves my soul.</l>
<l>The Queen of Asia!—But I must be calm,</l>
<l>The softer passions suit not with a state</l>
<l>So desperate as mine. Zemouca first</l>
<l>Must stretch his hand to Zingis, the event</l>
<l>May lead thy brother to his soul's desire.</l>
<l>Why, Mila, why in tears?</l>

<l>This tumult rose?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>All night the high divan</l>
<l>Sat in the tent of Zingis, and gave ear</l>
<l>To proffered terms, from Naima's perjur'd prince.</l>
<l>'Tis said they were axcepted. But the voice</l>
<l><pb n="15" facs="21"/>
Of war resounds thro' all the Niron camp.</l>
<l>The nations start, with ardor, to their arms;</l>
<l>Some daring enterprize is formed by Zingis,</l>
<l>Against deserted Aunac.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZEMOUCA.</speaker>
<l>Fear not that—</l>
<l>Tho' Zingis loves to move thro' bloody fields,</l>
<l>He tries not force, where policy avails.</l>
<l>If Naima promis'd, with her sovereign's blood,</l>
<l>To end this contest, Zingis will delay</l>
<l>To cross the Altay.—When the night descends,</l>
<l>I will remove the king,—at once prevent</l>
<l>The Naiman's treachery, and rid the world</l>
<l>Of the usurper.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>But that eagle sits</l>
<l>Too watchful on his rock,—we must not trust</l>
<l>Much to the foes neglect, for Zingis owes</l>
<l>To fortune less his greatness, than to skill</l>
<l>In war's extensive art.—We are too few</l>
<l>To reach him, thro' his armies; we must raise</l>
<l>Some other swords to penetrate those lines</l>
<l>The Niron draws around him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZEMOUCA.</speaker>
<l>Our success</l>
<l>Depends not on our numbers. We command</l>
<l>A hardy race, the Tartars of the north,</l>
<l>Whose souls partake the nature of the storms,</l>
<l>That rush across their climate. They delight</l>
<l>In the abrupt decision of the sword,</l>
<l>And love a deed of danger. Nor on them</l>
<l>Rest all our hopes: the fair Ovisa arms</l>
<l>Dishonour'd Timur in her father's cause.</l>
<l><pb n="16" facs="22"/>
His late disgrace, ambition, love, revenge,</l>
<l>Shall urge him on; and should the chief prefer</l>
<l>A tame submission to the will of Zingis,</l>
<l>To Aunac's daughter, and the Tartar throne,</l>
<l>Our glory must be greater, and our fame</l>
<l>Arise proportion'd to the perils round us.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>Friend of the hapless Aunac!—In thy voice</l>
<l>Speaks forth the hero, and thy noble fire</l>
<l>Falls on my soul, and kindles it to flame.</l>
<l>Ere next the light which now bursts from the East,</l>
<l>Shall gleam on Altay's streams, the Tartar tribes</l>
<l>Shall own another lord. Myself will rouse</l>
<l>The lion Timur; if that spirit dwells</l>
<l>In him, which animates th' Eluthian line,</l>
<l>Dishonour sits not lightly on his mind.</l>
<l>But where, Zemouca, shall my tribe receive</l>
<l>The king to night?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZEMOUCA.</speaker>
<l>Upon that narrow point,</l>
<l>Thou seest a lonely oak.—The morning star</l>
<l>Looks thro' its wav'ring branches,—there the rock</l>
<l>Stretching into the Altay, breaks the stream,</l>
<l>And forms a peaceful eddy. In that place</l>
<l>Shall Aunac land, when the wan moon descends</l>
<l>Behind the western hills.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CUBLA.</speaker>
<l>I will attend</l>
<l>To-day the court of Zingis, and disguise</l>

<l>Ha! I'll hear no more—</l>
<l>To recommend a crime my soul abhors,</l>

<l>Could Timur break</l>
<l>Thro' honor and his duty, he might raise</l>
<l>A flame, the billowy Caspian shou'd not quench.</l>
<l>But tho' my soul, undaunted in the field,</l>
<l>Swells at the growth of danger and demands</l>
<l>More than my share of battle; there are things</l>
<l>Which make me shudder, Cubla, and betray</l>
<l>A woman's weakness. Dark conspiracies,</l>
<l>Frauds cover'd o'er with art—those devious paths,</l>
<l>That lead the villains of the world to power,</l>

<l>To draw thy sword</l>
<l>Against thy father—Zingis—that proud man—</l>
<l>That tyrant of the East.—Thou startest, Timur,</l>
<l>His crimes, indeed, may shock a soul like thine.—</l>
<l>He, who without remorse, has trod on kings,</l>
<l>Has broke all sacred ties that bind mankind—</l>

<l>Go, tell thy father, Cubla is his foe:</l>

<l>Yes—to night, I meant,</l>

<l>To give Ovisa—Place thee next to him,</l>
<l>Who ought to rule the East.—To make thee heir</l>
<l>To Aunac's vast dominions. Dost thou still</l>
