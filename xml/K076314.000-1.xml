<head>ACT I. SCENE I.</head>
<stage>A pleasant Plain by a Wood-side; beyond it are seen, on one side, some of the Shepherds Hamlets; on the other (at a distance) the Walls of <hi>Phaerea,</hi> a Garrison of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi></stage>
<stage>Enter <hi>Climander</hi> meeting <hi>Arcasius;</hi> both drest like Shepherds.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Clim.</speaker>
<l>HAst thou provided me a Horse and Arms,</l>
<l>A Sword, <hi>Arcasius,</hi> that when Time has freed me</l>
<l>From the severe Injunctions of a Father,</l>
<l>May fill my Hand, instead of this vile Hook,</l>
<l>And fit it for the Work, a Prince is born to?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arca.</speaker>
<l>Unwillingly, I have obey'd your Orders;</l>
<l>But, 'till to-morrow's, and the next day's Sun</l>
<l>Shall light the angry, and contentious World,</l>
<l>Your Promise to your Father is in Force;</l>
<l>As well as the assurance, which you gave,</l>
<l>That in my Custody these Arms shou'd rest,</l>
<l>Until that fatal Time demands their Use.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="298" facs="305"/>
<speaker>Clim.</speaker>
<l>Call it not Fatal; Oh! that 'twere arriv'd!</l>
<l>That <hi>Aristomenes,</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> Terrour,</l>
<l>Were leading me, this moment, bravely on</l>
<l>Through Dangers, equal to the Cause he fights for,</l>
<l>Preserving these free Plains from foreign Bondage!</l>
<l>Though in the Strife this Body strew'd the Ground,</l>
<l>To Fame, and Publick Good an early Victim.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arca.</speaker>
<l>O wretched <hi>Rhodes!</hi> Thy Ruin is pronounc'd,</l>
<l>And thou beneath th'impending Plagues may'st perish;</l>
<l>Since He, whom Oracles appoint to Aid thee,</l>
<l>Thus wishes with his Own, to sell Thy Safety,</l>
<l>For the rash Praise of an intruding Warriour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clim.</speaker>
<l>No more of Oracles!</l>
<l>Which oftner we fulfil by heedless Chance,</l>
<l>Than the vain Study to pursue their Meaning;</l>
<l>Which makes me banish, from my lab'ring Thoughts,</l>
<l>Those Mystick Words, which serve but to perplex them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>From Mine they will not part, nor shou'd from Yours;</l>
<l>Which to prevent, ev'n now I will repeat them:</l>
<l>The Isle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> shall be <hi>of Peace</hi> bereft,</l>
<l>Unless it by the Heir thereof be left,</l>
<l>And that He wed, ere he returns agen,</l>
<l>The Beauteous Daughter of the Best of Men;</l>
<l><pb n="299" facs="306"/>
Whose Father's presence there shall save the State,</l>
<l>And smooth the threatning Brow of angry Fate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clim.</speaker>
<l>But, Who this Man, or, Where his Daughter is,</l>
<l>Was left in Darkness, to employ our Search:</l>
<l>Yet, in Obedience, Hither did I come</l>
<l>To feed a Flock, and mix with simple Swains;</l>
<l>Because the Priests, who sway in Princes Courts,</l>
<l>Declar'd, that perfect Innocence, and Virtue</l>
<l>Was to be found but in their lowly Rank,</l>
<l>And There, the Best of Men was to be sought for.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>'Tis True, they did; and therefore urg'd our Prince;</l>
<l>That stighting (in a Case of such Importance)</l>
<l>The Pride of Titles, and of equal Birth,</l>
<l>You might espouse One of these Rural Maids,</l>
<l>Whose Parents harmless Presence in our Land</l>
<l>Might bring the Blessings of the Gods upon us;</l>
<l>And, lest the Wars (which still infest these Countries)</l>
<l>Shou'd tempt you from the Fates, and his Design,</l>
<l>How strictly did He Charge it on your Duty,</l>
<l>That, 'till the Time, which now, Two Days must end,</l>
<l>You shou'd not leave these Plains, to seek the Camp!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clim.</speaker>
<l>Nor have I done it, as Thyself can witness,</l>
<l>But here have spent the long and lazy Hours,</l>
<l>Carelesly stretch'd beneath some <hi>Sylvan</hi> Shade,</l>
<l>And only sent my Wishes to their Tents:</l>
<l>But ere the Battle (which is soon intended)</l>
<l><pb n="300" facs="307"/>
Shall meet in glorious Tryal of their Right,</l>
<l>I will be there, and side with the <hi>Messenians.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>Oh! that you wou'd not!</l>
<l>That first your Native Country might be serv'd,</l>
<l>Think on her Danger, and your Sovereign's Will:</l>
<l>'Twas to the Reed, and not the wrangling Trumpet</l>
<l>He bid you listen, to secure his Peace;</l>
<l>Nor have you look'd with Love, as he requir'd,</l>
<l>On any Shepherdess, tho' ne'er so Fair,</l>
<l>Or born of Parents, harmless as their Flocks.</l>
<l>Low on my Knees, my Lord, let me prevail,</l>
<stage>[He Kneels.</stage>
<l>That, when the Time decreed you, do's expire,</l>
<l>You will not prosecute this rash Design;</l>
<l>But go with me yet farther on these Plains,</l>
<l>And seek to please your Father, and the Gods,</l>
<l>In such safe, humble ways, as they direct us.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clim.</speaker>
<l>Nay, prithee, do not kneel; it grates my Nature:</l>
<stage>[Raises him.</stage>
<l>But trust me, when we have subdued these Countries,</l>
<l>When <hi>Lacedemon</hi>'s Kings shall sue for Peace,</l>
<l>And make great <hi>Aristomenes</hi> Returns</l>
<l>Agreeing to his Merits, and their Wrongs,</l>
<l>And I have gain'd such Honour as becomes me;</l>
<l>Whate'er thou dost request shall be observ'd:</l>
<l>And tho' my Soul finds such vast disproportion</l>
<l>Betwixt the Thoughts, with which she is inspir'd,</l>
<l>And those, that lodge in these poor Country Maids;</l>
<l><pb n="301" facs="308"/>
Yet shall my Duty o'er my Temper rise,</l>
<l>I'll trust (like Others) only to my Eyes,</l>
<l>And think, that Women in Perfection are,</l>
<l>Tho ne'er so Ignorant, if Young and Fair,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>Ha!</l>
<stage>[A Noise is heard of distant Drums.</stage>
<l>Sure I hear the distant Sound of Drums. <stage>[Aside.</stage></l>
<l>Heav'n grant what I've been told, and kept so secret,</l>
<l>Of a Design this Day to end the War,</l>
<l>Be not a Truth too tempting for my Reasons!</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter frighted, <hi>Thaeta</hi> and <hi>Lamia,</hi> Shepherdesses.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lam.</speaker>
<l>Oh! may we here be safe, tell us <hi>Climander?</hi></l>
<l>For all the Lawns, that lie beyond the Hill,</l>
<l>Where still our Flocks were us'd to feed in peace,</l>
<l>Are fill'd with War, and dark with flying Arrows:</l>
<l>The Sheep disperse, whilst none regard their Safety,</l>
<l>But call on <hi>Pan,</hi> to shield th'advent'rous Chief,</l>
<l>The noble <hi>Aristomenes</hi> from Danger.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clim.</speaker>
<l>Hear me, <hi>Arcasius,</hi> hear and do not thwart me; <stage>[Aside to <hi>Arc.</hi></stage></l>
<l>Nor tye me to a few remaining Hours:</l>
<l>For, by the horrid Shield, that bears the <hi>Gorgon,</hi></l>
<l>I Swear; if thou refuse to arm me now</l>
<l>With what I sent thee lately to provide,</l>
<l>These Feet shall bear me sandal'd to the Battle,</l>
<l>This flow'ry Wreath shall mix with their stern Helmets,</l>
<l>And Death I'll take, if not impower'd to give it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="302" facs="309"/>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>Oh! do not ask my Aid; but in this Tryal,</l>
<l>Call all your fainting Virtue to assist</l>
<l>And help you keep your Promise to your Father.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clim.</speaker>
<l>I did not Promise him to be a Coward,</l>
<l>To let the Sound of War thus strike my Sense,</l>
<l>Yet keep my Heart in a cool, even Temper.</l>
<l>Hark! this way comes the Noise, and I will meet it.</l>
<stage>[As he is going, a confus'd Noise and Cry is heard within.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>They're Cries of Grief, and not the Shouts of Battle.</l>
<l>I hope All's past, lest He and <hi>Rhodes</hi> shou'd perish.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter meeting, <hi>Climander, Clinias,</hi> and other Shepherds.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>1st Shep.</speaker>
<l>Ruin'd, Undone!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<l>Let every Shepherd weep!</l>
<l>Turn their sweet Harmony to Sighs and Groans!</l>
<l>To the fierce Wolves deliver up their Flocks,</l>
<l>And leave <hi>Messenia</hi> to the cruel Victor!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clim.</speaker>
<l>The Victor, <hi>Clinias!</hi> is the Fight then over?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<l>It is, and We again the Slaves of <hi>Sparta.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clim.</speaker>
<l>Then <hi>Aristomenes</hi> must sure be breathless,</l>
<l>And, if he's Dead, fall'n in his Country's Cause:</l>
<l>The Gods have giv'n Him Fame, whilst We are Wretched.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<l>Oh! He's not Dead, but Living in their Power,</l>
<l><pb n="303" facs="310"/>
Which, 'tis believ'd, they'll use with utmost Rigour:</l>
<l>Pressing too far on the Auxiliary Troops,</l>
<l>The Foe surrounding bore him from his Horse,</l>
<l>Then with the Thongs of their curs'd <hi>Cretan</hi> Bows</l>
<l>Bound his strong Arms, and lead him off, in Triumph.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clim.</speaker>
<l>Convert, ye Powers, to Blood and Tears that Triumph!</l>
<l>Rescue from their vile Hands the noble Prey,</l>
<l>And send him warmer Friends than <hi>Demagetus,</hi> <stage>[Aside.</stage></l>
<l>Who, knowing not his Person, lov'd his Valour!</l>
<l>O ill-tim'd Duty, how hast thou betray'd me!</l>
<l>Where is <hi>Aristor?</hi> Where's the brave <hi>Alcander?</hi> <stage>[To them.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>The first may share in his great Father's Fate,</l>

<l><hi>Alcander</hi> heads, but cannot lead them on,</l>
<l>And 'tis believ'd they quickly will forsake him;</l>
<l>Such cold Dismay and Terrour has possess'd 'em!</l>
<l>Yet ere we part forever part from hence,</l>
<l>(If so the cruel Tyrant shou'd Decree)</l>
<l>Let us appoint one sad and solemn Meeting,</l>
<l>Where all the Ensigns of our former Mirth</l>
<l>May be defac'd and offer'd to His Praise,</l>

<l>And rob my fiery Youth of this first War,</l>
<l>(For which it languish'd with a Lover's Fondness)</l>
<l>By saying still 'twou'd last, 'till Time had freed me?</l>

<l>A hasty Death, to fall on old <hi>Arcasius:</hi></l>
<l>Nor think, this Posture means to cross your way;</l>
<l>For, by those Powers I swear; if they will Fight</l>
<l>As much, we hear 'tis doubted by the Shepherds,</l>
<l>I will not sue, to keep you from the Army,</l>

<l>Let me obtain but This, for all my Service,</l>

<l>Yet let me breathe so gently one Complaint,</l>
<l>So gently, that it may not break thy Peace,</l>

<l>Why, have me seiz'd, and bound with frantick Fetters,</l>
<l>Snatch'd from my Duty by a Woman's wile,</l>
<l>And here confin'd, whilst my great Father perish'd?</l>

<l>And on my Face (when <hi>Lacedemon</hi> mourn'd)</l>
<l>Suspected Smiles were seen to mock her Losses;</l>
<l>Because that Love was on the adverse Party.</l>

<l>Proceed thus to describe thy tender Soul,</l>
<l>And charm me with thy mighty Sense of Passion:</l>
<l><pb n="380" facs="387"/>
For know, 'twas that which fix'd me ever thine,</l>
<l>When with a Pleasure, not to be express'd,</l>
<l>I found no Language of my Love escap'd thee,</l>
<l>Tho' wrapt in Myst'ry to delude the Croud;</l>
<l>When ev'ry longing Look cou'd raise a Blush,</l>
<l>And every Sigh I breath'd, heave this lov'd Bosom,</l>
<l>Which held such soft Intelligence with mine,</l>
<l>And now o'erflows with a like Tide of Pleasure.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amal.</speaker>
<l>Oh! Yes, it do's; it meets the vast Delight,</l>
<l>And takes the Thoughts ev'n of <hi>Elysium</hi> from me,</l>
<l>Nor will I, as some peevish Beauty might,</l>
<l>Take light offence, that mine you did not mention;</l>
<l>Since 'tis my equalling <hi>Aristor</hi>'s Love</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Aristor.</speaker>
<l>Believe not, that I slighted such Perfections.</l>
<l>I saw you Fair, beyond the Fame of <hi>Helen;</hi></l>
<l>But Beauty's vain, and fond of new Applause,</l>
<l>Leaving the last Adorer in Despair</l>
<l>At his approach, who can but praise it better:</l>
<l>Whilst Love, <hi>Narcissus-</hi>like, courts his Reflection,</l>
<l>And seeks itself, gazing on other's Eyes.</l>
<l>When this I found in yours, it bred that Passion,</l>
<l>Which Time, nor Age, nor Death, shall e'er diminish.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Amal.</speaker>
<l>For Time, or Age, I think not of their Power.</l>
<l>But, after Death, <hi>Aristor,</hi> cou'd you love me,</l>
<l>Still call to me your Thoughts, when so far absent,</l>
<l><pb n="381" facs="388"/>
And mourn me sleeping in that Rival's Arms?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aristor.</speaker>
<l>Yes; if I cou'd outlive my <hi>Amalintha,</hi></l>
<l>Still shou'd I turn my Eyes to that cold Grave,</l>

<l>Thus sadly close with that too mournful Subject?</l>
<l>Why, now I press this Question, dost thou weep,</l>

<l>Paleness is on thy Cheek, and thy damp Brow</l>
<l>Strikes to my Heart such sympathizing Cold,</l>
<l>As quenches all its Fire, but that of Love.</l>
<l>Oh! speak my Life, my Soul, my <hi>Amalintha;</hi></l>
<l>Speak, and prevent the boding Fears that tell me</l>
<l>Eternal Separation is at hand,</l>

<l>Nay, if the gentle foldings of my Love,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aristor.</speaker>
<l>No, <hi>Amalintha;</hi> if it must be so,</l>
<l>Together we'll expire, and trace those Worlds,</l>

<l>Oh! let me plead in Death against that Purpose,</l>
<l>Employ my Hand, yet warm, to close the Wound,</l>
<l>And with my suppling Tears disperse the Anguish.</l>
<l>Your Country asks your stay, and more your Father:</l>
<l>This Blood is his, ally'd to all his Virtues,</l>

<l>Yes, I will live, ye Sov'reign Pow'rs, I will:</l>
<l>You've put my Virtue to its utmost Proof;</l>
<l>Yet thus chastis'd, I own superiour Natures,</l>
<l>And all your fixt Decrees this Sword shall further,</l>
<l>'Till <hi>Rhodes</hi> is rescu'd, and my Task completed.</l>
<l>Who knows, but that the Way to your <hi>Elysium</hi></l>
<l>Is Fortitude in Ills, and brave Submission;</l>
<l>Since Heroes whom your Oracles distinguish,</l>
<l>Are often here amidst their Greatness wretched?</l>
<l>But yet my Heart! my lov'd, my lost <hi>Aristor!</hi></l>

<l>Let me succeed him in his active Duty,</l>
<l>And join with all the Earth to bring you Comfort.</l>

<l>Comfort on Earth! Oh! 'tis not to be found.</l>
<l>My <hi>Demagetus,</hi> thou hast far to travel;</l>
<l><pb n="390" facs="399"/>
The Bloom of Youth sits graceful on thy Brow,</l>
<l>And bids thee look for Days of mighty Pleasures,</l>
<l>For prosp'rous Wars, and the soft Smiles of Beauty,</l>
<l>For generous Sons, that may reflect thy Form,</l>
<l>And give thee Hopes, as I had, of their succour.</l>

<speaker>Demag.</speaker>
<l>With these indeed my Thoughts have still been flatter'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aristom.</speaker>
<l>Then let me draw this flatt'ring Veil aside,</l>
<l>And bid thee here, here in this Face behold</l>
<l>How biting Cares have done the work of Age,</l>
<l>And in my best of Strength mark'd me a Dotard.</l>
<l>Defeated Armies, slaughter'd Friends are here;</l>
<l>Disgraceful Bonds, and Cities laid in Ashes:</l>
<l>And if thou find'st, that Life will yet endure it,</l>
<l>Since what I here have lost‚Äî</l>
<l>So bow'd, so waining shalt thou see this Carcass,</l>
<l>That scarce thou wilt recall what once it was.</l>
<l>Then be instructed Thou, and All that hear me,</l>
<l>Not to expect the compass of soft Wishes,</l>
<l>Or constant Joys, which fly the fond Possessor.</l>
<l><hi>Since</hi> Man, <hi>by swift returns of Good and Ill,</hi></l>
<l><hi>In all the Course of Life's uncertain still;</hi></l>
<l><hi>By Fortune favour'd now, and now opprest,</hi></l>
<l><hi>And not, 'till Death, secure of Fame, or Rest.</hi></l>
