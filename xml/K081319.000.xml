<head>SCENE I.<stage>— Chambers in the Temple.</stage></head>
<stage>Tom Careless <hi>and</hi> Mr. Cycle.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>WHATE'ER the success of your journey may be,</l>
<l>My dear rural sage, you are welcome to me:</l>
<l>Your benevolent projects I hope you'll complete,</l>
<l>By this trip from your snug scientific retreat.</l>
<l>In return for amusement you've given me there,</l>
<l>By your fine apparatus, and lectures on air,</l>
<l>I'll shew you the town; and the town is a science.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>On my tutor, dear Tom, I've a perfect reliance,</l>
<l>For I know in that study what vigils you've kept.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>'Tis the only one, truly, where I'm an adept;</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="4"/>For as to the law, that's the science of thorns,</l>
<l>And tho' its black robe my lean figure adorns,</l>
<l>Perhaps twice a year, for my father's good pleasure,</l>
<l>I've renounc'd, I confess, both its toil and its treasure.</l>
<l>From my sapient Lord Coke this advantage I gain;</l>
<l>He led me to find out a flaw in my brain,</l>
<l>That title! on which, as wise parents have done,</l>
<l>My father laid claim to the seals for his son.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>Such language, dear Tom, is in truth but a brogue,</l>
<l>That betrays the young heir as an indolent rogue.</l>
<l>'Tis the cant of ye all—ye want talents to drudge.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Well! think me, my friend, wise enough for a judge,</l>
<l>I still must rejoice I have nothing to do,</l>
<l>As my heart now inclines me to wait upon you.</l>
<l>I wish I could raise you the cash you require,</l>
<l>But you know I depend on a close-handed sire,</l>
<l>Who promises largely, and often has said</l>
<l>He will make me a Croesus whenever I wed;</l>
<l>But to drive me, I think, to the conjugal state,</l>
<l>Keeps the purse of the batchelor woefully strait;</l>
<l>And guineas at present are scarce, to my sorrow.</l>
<l>How much are you now come to London to borrow?</l>
<l>Two thousand, d'ye say?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>Yes! two thousand at least,</l>
<l>And perhaps rather more, as my plan is increas'd.</l>
<l>I wish for no profit, but public esteem;</l>
<l>And much good to the world must arise from my scheme.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="5"/>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Well! I wish you may prosper, but, as I'm a sinner,</l>
<l>I as soon should expect a roast Phoenix for dinner,</l>
<l>As in times like the present such loans from a friend,</l>
<l>When Opulence has not a stiver to lend.</l>
<l>You philosophers look with contempt upon cash;</l>
<l>But the fools of this town are so fond of the trash,</l>
<l>That as you're a chemist, both skilful and bold,</l>
<l>You had best try to make a few odd lumps of gold;</l>
<l>And this newly-found art you may try with less cost,</l>
<l>Since to borrow with ease seems an art that is lost.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>Dear Careless, you're welcome to rally my hopes;</l>
<l>So attack them with all your rhetorical tropes!</l>
<l>The man is ill-wrapt in philosophy's cloak,</l>
<l>Whose bosom is ruffled, dear Tom, by a joke.</l>
<l>I know money's scarce; yet I will not despond:</l>
<l>I've two friends who'll supply what I want, on my bond.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>What! <hi>two</hi> such good friends; so rich, open, and free!</l>
<l>Dear Cycle, I pray introduce them to me;</l>
<l>For not one of that cast my long list can produce:</l>
<l>Why! man, such a friend is the golden-egg'd goose;</l>
<l>You may hunt for the bird e'en as long as you're able,</l>
<l>But at last you will find it is only a fable.</l>
<l>I wanted but one hundred pounds, t'other day,</l>
<l>And ask'd fifty friends, that chance threw in my way,</l>
<l>But they all shook their heads, with a negative nod,</l>
<l>So I dunn'd my old father, in spite of the rod.</l>
<l>But pray do I know the good creatures you mean?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>Aye! both.—They're two friends, whom for years I've not seen;</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="6"/>But in juvenile days I held each as my brother,</l>
<l>And I trust that we all are still dear to each other.</l>
<l>You're acquainted with Beril—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Well! there, I confess;</l>
<l>Your wishes have some little chance of success.</l>
<l>If there's one in the world, who, regardless of pelf,</l>
<l>Would relieve a friend's wants, tho' he straiten'd himself;</l>
<l>You have now nam'd the man. Yet perhaps he can't lend:</l>
<l>I know he has suffer'd by aiding a friend;</l>
<l>And I fancy he has but a slender estate.</l>
<l>'Tis true, he don't play, tho' carest by the great;</l>
<l>Yet in statues and books he's expensive 'tis, said—</l>
<l>I have seen him bid high for a porphyry head.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>'Tis hard, fortune still should torment him with crosses;</l>
<l>I sooth'd him to bear the severest of losses:</l>
<l>I was with him, when blasted in youth's blooming charm▪</l>
<l>His lovely Sophia was torn from his arms.</l>
<l>You knew not, I think, that unfortunate fair,</l>
<l>The victim of cruelty, love, and despair.</l>
<l>She was bound to our friend by a mutual affection,</l>
<l>But her rich sordid parents oppos'd the connection.</l>
<l>The canker of sorrow incessantly prey'd</l>
<l>On the perishing bloom of the delicate maid:</l>
<l>Her duty, her suff'rings, made nature relent,</l>
<l>And wrung from her father a tardy consent;</l>
<l>But death render'd vain the late sanction he gave,</l>
<l>And his child's bridal bed was the pitiless grave.</l>
<l>Many years have now soften'd the lover's wild grief:</l>
<l>Perhaps some new beauty now yields him relief.</l>
<l>He's still single, I think?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="7"/>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Yes! in learning and art</l>
<l>He has sought the chief balm for the wounds of his heart;</l>
<l>Hence a pleasing mild elegance runs thro' his life;</l>
<l>And had I a sister I'd wish her his wife.—</l>
<l>But now for your second friend!—What is his name?</l>
<l>For acquaintance with him too I'll certainly claim.</l>
<l>You say that I know him: come! tell me who is it!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>Yes! indeed, it is one whom you frequently visit.</l>
<l>And here you must own, that my hopes are well founded,</l>
<l>Since in kindness and wealth he has ever abounded;</l>
<l>And a legacy lately—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>You don't mean Bijou,</l>
<l>That collector of knick-knacks?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>Indeed, Tom, I do.</l>
<l>I've a title to ask any favor from him:</l>
<l>He has some little vanity, some little whim,</l>
<l>Yet still he's a friendly, benevolent man.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>You may rap at his door—but get in if you can!</l>
<l>Your friend, when you saw him, was jocund and free,</l>
<l>His heart full of bounty, his spirit of glee;</l>
<l>His vanities too had so mirthful a cast,</l>
<l>That Friendship herself even wish'd them to last.</l>
<l>But Marriage, that changer of mind and of feature,</l>
<l>Has made poor Bijou quite a different creature.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>I am told that his wife, with a pocket well laden,</l>
<l>Was a little, fat, ancient, and well-behav'd maiden;</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="8"/>Who, having a similar taste for virtù,</l>
<l>Put her cabinet under the care of Bijou.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Yes, indeed! in an odd fit of amorous hunger,</l>
<l>He married an old curiosity-monger,</l>
<l>Who is ready to faint, if a visitor knocks</l>
<l>While she's brushing the dust from her raree-shew box.</l>
<l>Her maid t'other day threw her into a swoon,</l>
<l>By cracking the eye of a great stuff'd baboon;</l>
<l>For instead of young children, whose troublesome noise</l>
<l>Might disturb their sedate, <hi>virtuosical</hi> joys,</l>
<l>She fills their fine house with new monsters or mummies.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>Of your story, dear Tom, I perceive what the sum is.</l>
<l>You don't like the lady:—she may not please you,</l>
<l>And yet be an excellent wife for Bijou.</l>
<l>I am told she has really much merit and taste.</l>
<l>In her morals they say she's remarkably chaste;</l>
<l>So with lectures, perhaps, she has wounded your ear,</l>
<l>And you rakes of the Temple may think her severe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>No, faith! with the lady I stand very well,</l>
<l>I bought her esteem with an old empty shell.</l>
<l>I own she has piety, morals, and sense:</l>
<l>To chastity no one will doubt her pretence.</l>
<l>But tho' with these virtues I freely invest her,</l>
<l>My heart, I confess, is inclin'd to detest her.</l>
<l>She has ruin'd her husband—at least so I think;</l>
<l>To a dwarf she has made his benevolence shrink,</l>
<l>And puff'd up his vanity into a giant.</l>
<l>To all her strange whims he's so servilely pliant,</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="9"/>He'd obey her caprice, whatsoe'er it might hint,</l>
<l>And deny himself bread to buy her an odd flint.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>Why, Tom, that's a proof of his fond tender heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>To me it proves nought but her ladyship's art:</l>
<l>And so you yourself would explain the whole riddle,</l>
<l>If you heard her once flatter his pencil or fiddle,</l>
<l>As a more wretched brush never blotted poor paper,</l>
<l>And ne'er squeak'd a Cremona beneath a worse scraper.</l>
<l>Tho' pamper'd with flattery thus by his wife,</l>
<l>Our friend has quite lost all his humor and life;</l>
<l>And whenever I look on his cold chearless face,</l>
<l>As he stands by the side of his wife's fossil-case,</l>
<l>I think her a perfect Medusa, I own,</l>
<l>Who has turn'd her poor husband himself into stone.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>You loungers, dear Tom, in your idle disputes,</l>
<l>Love to ridicule all life's amusing pursuits:</l>
<l>But they all have their use; and the lady who joys</l>
<l>In collecting an odd set of whimsical toys,</l>
<l>Is herself a rare gem, that my judgment regards,</l>
<l>More than all the fair votaries of scandal and cards.</l>
<l>I know I shall like her, in spite of your stricture,</l>
<l>And I'm going to see how you've fail'd in her picture.</l>
<l>My old friend's good-will I shall put to the trial,</l>
<l>And solicit his aid without fear of denial.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Come along!—I will see if your welcome is hearty;</l>
<l>Indeed I may serve you by joining the party,</l>
<l>And I'm eager to know (for my portrait is true)</l>
<l>What you think of the change she has wrought in Bijou.</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="10"/>To a knowledge of nature I ne'er will pretend,</l>
<l>If, when you have seen, in the house of our friend,</l>
<l>All the natural rarities rang'd in a glass,</l>
<l>You don't rank his heart in the petrified class.

<stage>with a Brush.</stage>
<l>Lackaday! would I once were well out of this house,</l>
<l>Where I tremble to move, full as much as a mouse!</l>
<l>And Nanny's afraid to come into this room;</l>
<l>Indeed the poor creature can scarce hold a broom,</l>
<l>For my mistress, she says, has done nothing but bait her,</l>
<l>Since she brush'd off the tail of the new alligator.</l>
<l>I've a great mind to lay up my brush on the shelf,</l>
<l>And leave madam to dust all her monsters herself,</l>
<l>Would my master would make her, for these stocks and stones,</l>
<l>A young little plaything of good flesh and bones!</l>
<l>But, alas! these old ladies who can't raise a baby,</l>
<l>Are as full of nonsensical maggots as may be.</l>
<l>And our house is so cramm'd with this whimsical jumble,</l>
<l>That if you touch one thing, another will tumble,</l>
<l>Madam says, I misplace whatsoever I clean,</l>
<l>But I'll venture to wipe off the dust from this screen.</l>
<stage>Throws it down▪</stage>
<l>A plague take the things! they do nothing but fall.</l>
<l>Lud! my fingers have run thro' the cover and all.</l>
<stage>Taking up the Screen, and uncovering it.</stage>
<l><pb n="13" facs="11"/>'Tis my master's new drawing—how madam will thunder—</l>
<l>This fine naked beauty I've torn quite asunder:</l>
<l>And the rent must be seen—I can thrust my whole thumb in,</l>
<l>And I've no time to mend it—my mistress is coming—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU</speaker>
<stage>(entering in a dark brown Bed-gown, with a Brush of Peacock's Feathers.)</stage>
<l>Some new mischief's done here.—Lord! Joan what's the matter?</l>
<l>I am sure you broke something—I heard such a clatter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
<l>Indeed, Ma'am, I've had a most cruel disaster,</l>
<l>The screen—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>What! the beautiful work of your master!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
<l>My finger slipt thro', as I wip'd it in haste,</l>
<l>But I'm sure I can mend it again with some paste.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>You awkward, pert hussy! pray let it alone!</l>
<l>Can paste mend a flaw in a goddess's zone?</l>
<l>Ye stars! give me patience!—Get out of this door,</l>
<l>And pray let me never set eyes on you more!</l>
<l>I knew I should suffer as soon as you came,</l>
<l>For taking a thing with so gothic a name.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JOAN.</speaker>
<l>I'll go—for I live but the life of a cur:</l>
<l>Yet pray! on my name do not throw any slur!</l>
<l>I am sure 'tis good English, altho' it is Joan,</l>
<l>And that's more than you're able to say of your own.
<stage>Exit.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU</speaker>
<stage>(entering.)</stage>
<l>What's the matter, my dear?—What new plague from your maids?</l>
<l>You for ever are vext by these pestilent jades:</l>
<l><pb n="14" facs="12"/>If bred in this town, you object to their morals;</l>
<l>If rusties, they break all your glasses or corals.</l>
<l>Let 'em come whence they will, they bring trouble and strife,</l>
<l>And your quarrels have made me half sick of my life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Don't say so!—You know, my dear Mr. Bijou,</l>
<l>I take no young maids, out of fondness to you;</l>
<l>And these middle-ag'd creatures are all so unhandy,</l>
<l>They make me as fretful as old Mr. Shandy.</l>
<l>But, my dear, if you see me sometimes in a flame,</l>
<l>I think you won't say that my temper's to blame:</l>
<l>'Twas my love for the works of your delicate hand,</l>
<l>Which produc'd an emotion I could not command.</l>
<l>If I rated old Joan in a great agitation,</l>
<l>I am sure you will own I had much provocation,</l>
<l>When you see this sad cause of the bustle between us:</l>
<l>She has utterly ruin'd your very best Venus,</l>
<l>This new lovely drawing! the joy of all eyes!</l>
<l>I vow I could cry.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>What sweet softness!—she cries!—</l>
<l>These feelings, indeed, prove the true connoisseur:</l>
<l>This ill treatment of Art her fine sense can't endure.</l>
<l>Henceforth, of my works let them say what they will,</l>
<l>No painter can boast such a test of his skill.—</l>
<l>Come, chear up, my dear Cognoscente! come! come!</l>
<l>I can mend it again with a brush-full of gum.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>D'ye think you can mend it?—and won't it look brown,</l>
<l>If you don't hide the skin with the skirt of a gown?</l>
<l><pb n="15" facs="13"/>'Twould be pity to cloak up a body so fine,</l>
<l>Especially since you have drawn it from mine.</l>
<l>And you know I caught cold, when I stript to the waist,</l>
<l>To fit for the figure, in true attic taste:</l>
<l>But I did it from fondness, that you might not roam,</l>
<l>And wickedly hunt after models from home.</l>
<l>To be sure I love art—but all artists, they say,</l>
<l>By their studies of nature are tempted to stray;</l>
<l>And I own that your genius gives me great alarms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>My dear, tender creature! pray trust your own charms!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Affectionate terrors will rise in my head.</l>
<l>I was jealous, I own, t'other day, of the dead.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>What fond sensibility! exquisite feeling!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>I hope I was wrong, but strange fancies will steal in,</l>
<l>When fondness has open'd the heart to suspicion.</l>
<l>You're so dear to the females of every condition:</l>
<l>But, I hope, Lady Fancybird was not so vicious;</l>
<l>There was nothing, indeed, in her air meretricous;</l>
<l>Yet a jealous pang seiz'd me, I own, when I found</l>
<l>That by will she bequeath'd to you three thousand pound.</l>
<l>'Tis true, that a legacy's very commodious;</l>
<l>Yet the money appears to me utterly odious,</l>
<l>When I think it was possibly meant as the price</l>
<l>Of endearments, to which she had art to entice,</l>
<l>And not in return for the pictures you drew,</l>
<l>Of her parrot, her bull-finch, and old cockatoo.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="14"/>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Lord! my dear, if such phantoms your quiet consume,</l>
<l>You will make the old lady jump out of her tomb.</l>
<l>'Tis true, that I flatter'd her favourite passion,</l>
<l>As I love to be well with old ladies of fashion:</l>
<l>But pray don't suppose, I was e'er so absurd</l>
<l>As to stroke her pale cheek for the pole of her bird.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Ah! you humorous man, you've such infinite wit,</l>
<l>You can turn to a jest whatsoe'er you think fit!—</l>
<l>But my heart on this point can be never at ease,</l>
<l>Unless you'll allow me to spend, as I please,</l>
<l>Half the money, of which you're so oddly possest;</l>
<l>Aud then I shall think it an honest bequest.</l>
<l>Besides, there's an auction at Lady Toy-Truckle's,</l>
<l>And I long for a rap at the Duchess's knuckles,</l>

<l>You are sure I shall turn it to something most rare:</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Mr. Cycle! my worthy, old friend! how d'ye do? —</l>
<l>Give me leave to present to you Mrs. Bijou!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>I'm asham'd to be found in this garb.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>O! my dear,</l>
<l>From a man of true science you've nothing to fear;</l>
<l>He'll freely allow, for he's candid and just,</l>
<l>Philosophical ladies must dabble in dust.—</l>
<l>Mr. Cycle, my wife is a curious collector:</l>
<l>In natural knowledge I hope you'll direct her;</l>
<l>You are master of all, from the earth to the stars,</l>
<l>And may aid her in ranging her fossils and spars.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>She shall freely command all the little I know.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>You're extremely obliging, dear Sir, to say so</l>
<l><pb n="18" facs="16"/>But I cannot attend you in this dusty vest.</l>
<l>I'll soon slip it off.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>You shan't stir, I protest.</l>
<l>To talk of your dress, my dear Ma'am, is a joke,</l>
<l>To a sage, who exists but in chemical smoke.</l>
<l>Your robe is indeed like the robe of Saint Bruno,</l>
<l>Yet still by your air we might take you for Juno;</l>
<l>While the tail of your peacock, that type of command,</l>
<l>With such dignity waves in your awful white hand.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>You're a young saucy creature!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>These idle rogues, Madam,</l>
<l>More like sons of the Serpent, than children of Adam,</l>
<l>Are apt to esteem it a dull occupation,</l>
<l>To study the wonders of this fair creation:</l>
<l>And hence they all rally, with humour ill-plac'd,</l>
<l>Those who seek for amusement in science and taste.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Well said! Mr. Cycle—I'm glad that Virtù</l>
<l>Has found both a friend and a champion in you.</l>
<l>Come and peep at my wife's philosophical treasure!</l>
<l>I hope you'll survey it again, at your leisure.—</l>
<l>My dear, d'ye allow me to shew your museum?—</l>
<l>I'm exact in all matters of <hi>tuum</hi> and <hi>meum.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>

<l>It is open.—Come, Sir!

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Tell me, Tom, if you can,</l>
<l><pb n="19" facs="17"/>Is not this Mr. Cycle a man of great worth,</l>
<l>Who wrote a most excellent book on the Earth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>'Tis the author himself; and I know not what college</l>
<l>Can shew his superior in virtue and knowledge.</l>
<l>He's a man of few words, with a heart and a mind</l>
<l>Ever busied in schemes for the good of mankind;</l>
<l>And he now visits London, in hopes to procure</l>
<l>Some support in a plan for relieving the poor.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>The poor!—of their name I'm alarm'd at the mention:</l>
<l>Mr. Cycle, indeed, may have no ill intention,</l>
<l>But I fear he'll involve my good husband in trouble—</l>
<l>These projects of charity end in a bubble.</l>
<l>The poor are ungrateful, disorderly wretches,</l>
<l>Who can shift for themselves by their tricks and their fetches;</l>
<l>They deserve not a learned philosopher's thought.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Your pardon!—He'll think, if he thinks as he ought,</l>
<l>That Philosophy, drawing from Heaven her birth,</l>
<l>Is the science of soft'ning the evils on earth.</l>
<l>By your fears you have done our friend infinite wrong,</l>
<l>For tho' his heart's tender, his judgment is strong:</l>
<l>To the projects of Folly he never can stoop—</l>
<l>Philanthropy's friend is not Phantasy's dupe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Why, Careless! you talk in a language quite new:</l>
<l>Who could dream of a charity-sermon from you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Oh! a cobler can preach, when his spirit's inflam'd.</l>
<l>Mine is apt to blaze forth, if I hear a friend blam'd;</l>
<l><pb n="20" facs="18"/>And indeed I can't stifle my heart's ebullitions,</l>
<l>When such good folks as you harbour vile suppositions.</l>
<l>But I'm sure you'll forgive all the warmth I have shewn,</l>
<l>When the worth of our friend is to you better known.</l>
<l>If you're angry, I know that your anger will cease,</l>
<l>When you hear on what terms I can purchase my peace.</l>
<l>A shell I can bring you—my interest such is—</l>
<l>Very like what you lately gave up to the Duchess.</l>
<l>Perhaps I may give it you—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>You're a good soul—</l>
<l>As large as her Grace's, and perfectly whole?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Yes, I think 'tis as large, and in colour as high.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Are you sure of its shape?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Do you question my eye?</l>
<l>I'll convince you I'm right; let us instantly look</l>
<l>At the fine colour'd plates in your great Danish book.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>

<l>This scheme, my good friend, does you honor indeed.</l>
<l>In a business so noble I hope you'll proceed;</l>
<l>And may you accomplish your utmost desires,</l>
<l>In raising the sum which your project requires!—</l>
<l><pb n="21" facs="19"/>Pray look at this new little drawing of mine!</l>
<l>Don't you think it an elegant pretty design?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>Very lively indeed!—But, my friend, you forget</l>
<l>What I've said on the point of incurring this debt.</l>
<l>Do not fly from the subject!—I hate all evasion:</l>
<l>I must say for your aid I have serious occasion.</l>
<l>You know what I've ask'd, and in asking I deem</l>
<l>That I give you a proof of my cordial esteem.</l>
<l>In a poor-house myself I would rather work hard,</l>
<l>Than apply thus to one whom I did not regard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Mr. Cycle, I know you're a man without guile,</l>
<l>And you think in a noble and singular style;</l>
<l>But if asking for cash is of love a sure test,</l>
<l>With affectionate friends all the wealthy are blest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>I have done, as I see that you wish to evade</l>
<l>A request, that I thought I with justice had made;</l>
<l>As you know, when of fortune you felt a reverse,</l>
<l>You had once the command of my prosperous purse;</l>
<l>And since you of opulence now are possest,</l>
<l>More enrich'd too of late by a friendly bequest,</l>
<l>I suppos'd, without trouble—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Dear Cycle, 'tis true:</l>
<l>You shall have it; but mum! towards Mrs. Bijou!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>O! I now understand all the cause of demur;</l>
<l>And if that is the case, I have done, my dear Sir.</l>
<l>At the hazard of discord the sum you shan't lend;</l>
<l>In family strife I'll not plunge my old friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="22" facs="20"/>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Do not think me a slave!—there's no danger of strife.</l>
<l>But you'll find, if you e'er try the conjugal life,</l>
<l>It is best not to waken the frowns of a wife.</l>
<l>Besides, there is surely no reason why you</l>
<l>Should talk on such business to Mrs. Bijou.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>There is certainly none—you shall do as you please.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>One thousand, my friend, I can spare you with ease;</l>
<l>'Tis the sum I shall go to receive very soon;</l>
<l>If you'll call here again, you shall have it by noon.</l>
<l>And to tell you the truth, I would have you make haste,</l>
<l>Lest my wife should demand it for matters of taste.</l>
<l>When an auction is near, she is apt to be rash,</l>
<l>In laying her hand upon all my loose cash;</l>
<l>And as she is thought so judicious a buyer,</l>
<l>Her elegant wishes I seldom deny her.</l>
<l>Yet 'tis time to grow prudent:—but hush! here they come.</l>

<l>But for such an engagement I'm sure you'll allow;</l>
<l>For the slies are all rang'd in the parlour below,</l>
<l>And a guest like the Baron one can't leave, you know.</l>
<l>As the key's in the case, he perhaps might unlock it,</l>
<l>And whip the best butterfly into his pocket.</l>

<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>If you can, by all means!—'twill be sav'd from her clutches,</l>
<l>Who would throw it away in out-bidding a Duchess:</l>
<l>And at auctions indeed she'd her husband undo,</l>
<l>Were she not in her house quite a close-handed Jew.</l>
<l>But on saving a penny she frequenly ponders,</l>
<l>And her avarice scrapes what her vanity squanders.—</l>
<l>O! if I were her master, her whimsies I'd cure,</l>
<l>And make a good wife of this vile connoisseur.—</l>
<l>Now for Beril—he's one of a different cast.</l>

<l>How I long in thy features to mark the effect</l>
<l>Produc'd by the wonders of exquisite art,</l>

<l>Why study those charms, that I know but too well?</l>

<l>For that I don't care.</l>
<l>Why I wish you to keep it, I'll freely declare:—</l>

<l>And that's five years, I think, next Bartholomew-tide,</l>
<l>There is only this statue, that's now in our sight,</l>
<l>In which you have seem'd to take any delight;</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>My Lord, I confess, I had hopes of this pleasure;</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>That's right, Mr. Beril:—I pray make it known,</l>
<l>That we come for the sake of the marble alone;</l>
<l>For tho' we have both a fair name, as I think,</l>
<l>Yet our poor reputations will instantly sink,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>Pray! my dear Lady Frances, advance to the place,</l>
<l>Which will give you, I think, the best view of the face.</l>

<l>You may still discern beauties resembling your own.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Whence came it, dear Beril?—'tis surely antique;</l>
<l>The work, my good friend, is undoubtedly Greek.</l>
<l>I swear the Laocoon is not so fine:</l>
<l>Had I choice of the two, this, I'm clear, would be mine.</l>
<l>The subject more pleasing! —expression still higher!—</l>
<l>This long-hidden treasure where could you acquire?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>I owe it to chance, to acknowledge the truth,</l>
<l>And a princely and brave Neapolitan youth,</l>
<l>Whom I luckily sav'd, in a villainous strife,</l>
<l>From the dagger of jealousy, aim'd at his life.</l>
<l>The work was dug up on his father's estate,</l>
<l>And, knowing my passion for marble is great,</l>
<l>He nobly has sent me the gift in your view,</l>
<l>In return for what accident led me to do.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>'Tis the first piece of sculpture perhaps on the earth,</l>
<l>And I hardly know how to appreciate its worth;</l>
<l><pb n="29" facs="27"/>But if ever you wish to dispose of the treasure,</l>
<l>I'll accept it at three thousand guineas with pleasure.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>My Lord, you now speak with that liberal spirit</l>
<l>Which you ever display when you estimate merit.</l>
<l>Tho' I own works of art, of such high estimation,</l>
<l>Seem but ill to agree with my fortune and station,</l>
<l>Yet these figures at present I wish to retain,</l>
<l>Tho' the wish may appear ostentatious and vain.</l>
<l>But, my Lord, if they e'er change their master anew,</l>
<l>They shall find a more worthy possessor in you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Well! ye dear connoisseurs! you amaze me, I own,</l>

<l>I indeed can believe 'tis a fine piece of art;</l>
<l>But to buy it for furniture!—as to my part,</l>
<l>I'd as soon o'er my house throw a sepulchre's gloom,</l>
<l>And purchase from Westminster-Abbey a tomb.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>You're a wild idle gipsy, and past all correcting;</l>
<l>You have not the least relish for what is affecting.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>That's your fault, dear Papa;—but my sister, you see,</l>
<l>Makes ample amends for this failing in me;</l>
<l>She gazes, like you, with such serious delight,</l>
<l>That she's half turn'd to marble herself by the sight:</l>
<l>I vow it has made her unable to speak,</l>
<l>And has drawn a cold tear down her petrified cheek.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>Pray! my dear, don't expose me!</l>

<sp>
<pb n="30" facs="28"/>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>O seek not to hide</l>
<l>What nature design'd your chief beauty and pride!—</l>
<l>With different charms she enriches the earth;</l>
<l>To your sister she gave the sweet dimples of mirth;</l>
<l>And, that each in her province no rival may find,</l>
<l>All the soft pensive graces to you she assign'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, you shine, Mr. Beril, most brightly,</l>
<l>In the delicate science of praising politely;</l>
<l>In which many beaux are so savagely stupid,</l>
<l>They a scalping-knife take for the weapon of Cupid;</l>
<l>And to tickle one nymph, basely slash every other.—</l>
<l>Well! dear Frances, how are you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>Indeed I can't smother,</l>
<l>What I feel in surveying this wonder of art;</l>
<l>It has something which takes such fast hold of the heart.</l>
<l>In the faint dying wife such a fond resignation!</l>
<l>In the poor widow'd husband such wild agitation!</l>
<l>Such sorrow! such anguish! such love to Alcestis!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>That is true; but I know the whole story a jest is;</l>
<l>And Admetus, I think, such a shuffling poltroon,</l>
<l>That he moves me no more than the man in the moon.</l>
<l>A pitiful fellow! to live, in his case,</l>
<l>And let his poor wife pass the Styx in his place!</l>
<l>Modern husbands, indeed, I believe would be merry,</l>
<l>If their wives in their stead would cross over that ferry.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="29"/>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>But perhaps, Ma'am, you think that no husband could find</l>
<l>A young modern wife of Alcestis's mind?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>No! indeed, my good Sir!—Here's my dear sister Fan,</l>
<l>She'd be willing to die, to preserve her good man;</l>
<l>But I own for myself, I should doubt and demur,</l>
<l>If I thought my spouse wish'd his own trip to defer:</l>
<l>Tho' myself to his fortunes I'd freely devote,</l>
<l>If we both might embark at one time in the boat;</l>
<l>I confess I should scarce be so wondrously kind,</l>
<l>As to set sail myself, but to leave him behind.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Tom and Harriot have long had flirtations together,</l>
<l>But their courtship has changeable fits, like the weather:</l>
<l>The improvident girl, thinking lovers are plenty,</l>
<l>Declares she won't wed till she's past one-and-twenty;</l>
<l>Nor e'en then take her beau, (in her charms such her trust is)</l>
<l>Unless he bids fair to become a chief justice;</l>
<l>And Tom is the heir of too large an estate,</l>
<l>To load his gay spirit with law's heavy weight.</l>
<l><pb n="32" facs="30"/>But here comes our young lawyer, to urge his own plea!</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Careless <hi>and</hi> Mr. Cycle.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>My dear Tom! how d'ye do?—My good stars! can it be?</l>
<l>Is it you, my dear Cycle, my long-absent friend?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>And still heartily yours.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>But why would you not send,</l>
<l>And of your affection afford me a proof,</l>
<l>By bespeaking your quarters here under my roof.</l>
<l>However I'm happy that chance is so kind,</l>
<l>As to give me th' occasion I've long wish'd to find,</l>
<l>To present you to one, who, of all men on earth,</l>
<l>Is most able to judge of your genius and worth.—</l>
<l>My dear Lord, to your notice now let me commend</l>
<l>The man to whose name you're already a friend!</l>
<l>Behold Mr. Cycle!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Dear Sir, let me say,</l>
<l>That I often have wish'd for this fortunate day,</l>
<l>Which makes me acquainted with one whom I deem</l>
<l>So justly entitled to public esteem;</l>
<l>Whose writings and life shew in fairest alliance,</l>
<l>Philanthropical virtue and genuine science.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>My good Lord, these are honours far more than my due,</l>
<l>Yet I own with delight I receive them from you;</l>
<l>As you're led to o'er-rate my poor merits, I feel,</l>
<l>By this dear partial friend's kind affectionate zeal.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="33" facs="31"/>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>He indeed is your friend—I regard his applause;</l>
<l>But to wish your acquaintance I've still higher cause.</l>
<l>Be assur'd I shall think myself truly your debtor,</l>
<l>If you'll give me the pleasure of knowing you better.</l>
<l>Either Beril or Careless will guide you to me;</l>
<l>I have some things perhaps it may please you to see:</l>
<l>Yet no gem, I believe, that's so worthy your sight,</l>
<l>As a statue which Beril has just brought to light.</l>
<l>Allow me to shew it you—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL</speaker>
<stage>(<hi>to</hi> Lady Frances.)</stage>
<l><hi>Your</hi> tender breast,</l>
<l>My dear Lady Frances, I fear, is opprest▪</l>
<l>By this sculptur'd distress, the mere creature of art,</l>
<l>Yet too painful a scene for so feeling a heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>No, indeed! at first sight, tho' it made my veins thrill,</l>
<l>And I felt thro' my bosom a cold icy chill,</l>
<l>That impression once over, I view it again</l>
<l>With a soothing delight, unembitter'd by pain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT</speaker>
<stage>(<hi>to</hi> Careless.)</stage>
<l>And pray, Sir, from <hi>which</hi> court of justice come you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>From the worshipful court of wise Madam Bijou;</l>
<l>Where, blind as old Themis, she utters decrees</l>
<l>On the price of stuff'd parrots and petrified trees.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>O you mischievous creature! you certainly mean,</l>
<l>By the sound of her name to awaken my spleen:</l>
<l>You know that the thought of her sickens me quite,</l>
<l>And that I at her house must do penance to-night.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="34" facs="32"/>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Then I vow I'll be there, if it's only to see</l>
<l>How Mortification and you may agree:</l>
<l>Even that gloomy spright must appear with some grace,</l>
<l>If it lurks in the lines of so lively a face.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>All my gaiety dies when her presence I come in;</l>
<l>No cramp-fish could give me a shock so benumbing—</l>
<l>She's my utter aversion—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Pray tell me, my dear,</l>
<l>Of whom do you speak in a style so severe?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>Of your friend, dear Papa, your good Mrs. Bijou.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>That's ungrateful, dear Harriot—she's civil to you;</l>
<l>And you should not indulge a satyrical vein.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>You forget, my dear Sir, how you often complain</l>
<l>That her low little pride, and nonsensical whim,</l>
<l>Have reduc'd your old friend to a pitiful trim;</l>
<l>And I think she has made him so gloomy a slave,</l>
<l>She has pent her good man in Trophonius' cave.</l>
<l>Such to him was the temple of Hymen; for after</l>
<l>He enter'd its vestibule,—farewell to laughter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Why, Harriot! you really are quite acrimonious:</l>
<l>But if you call wedlock the cave of Trophonius,</l>
<l>Have a care, if that cavern you chance to step near!</l>
<l>You love laughing too well to resign it, my dear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="35" facs="33"/>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>And therefore, tho' woo'd like the nymph of Toboso,</l>
<l>I never will marry an old virtuoso,</l>
<l>Who thinks himself blest with taste, science, and worth,</l>
<l>Because he picks up all the odd things on earth.—</l>
<l>When a passion for art, or for nature, is join'd</l>
<l>With a warm friendly heart, and a liberal mind,</l>
<l>I respect the pure taste which that union produces,</l>
<l>Free from vanity's sordid fantastic abuses.</l>
<l>Tho' I do not possess it, I see and commend</l>
<l>Such taste, dear Papa, both in you and your friend;</l>
<l>But I view with an utter contempt, I confess,</l>
<l>Those who awkwardly ape what you really possess:</l>
<l>And for Mrs. Bijou, she has just as much soul</l>
<l>As a monkey, who carries queer things to its hole:</l>
<l>She with wonderful gusto, half Gothic, half Dutch,</l>
<l>Like an old squirrel, hides all she can in her hutch.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>An excellent portrait! and true, I protest,</l>
<l>For I've just had a peep at the old squirrel's nest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>Pray, since we together her closet inspected,</l>
<l>What whimsical rarities has she collected?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>O, before I could count half the baubles she buys,</l>
<l>I could tell you the name of each star in the skies:</l>
<l>Her sphere is too wide for my genius to scan it;</l>
<l>But I know what she reckons her Georgian planet,</l>
<l>Her newly-found star—which to-night, if you're free,</l>
<l>Thro' a glass she perhaps may allow you to see.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="36" facs="34"/>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>What wonder is this?—is it flesh, fish, or fowl?</l>
<l>A Lilliput dog? or a Brobdignag owl?</l>
<l>Or is it a remnant from Joseph's odd coat?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>It is something once held by a person of note</l>
<l>In our island; and now I defy you to guess.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>Is it Essex's ring? or the ruff of Queen Bess?</l>
<l>Or Alfred's cake-toaster? or Rizzio's fiddle?</l>
<l>Pray tell me!—I hate to be teaz'd by a riddle.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>In short, 'tis a night-cap, not worth half a groat,</l>
<l>Which she for a guinea has luckily bought;</l>
<l>Because this old fragment of worsted, she vows,</l>
<l>Once serv'd as a crown for poor Chatterton's brows:</l>
<l>Tho' I think we should find, if we knew the whole truth,</l>
<l>That the cap was ne'er seen by that wonderful youth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>Now, Chatterton! boast, that thy ill-fated verse</l>
<l>Can teach antiquarians to open their purse!</l>
<l>Yet hadst thou, in misery, su'd for that guinea,</l>
<l>Its mistress had call'd thee a vain rhyming ninny;</l>
<l>And prov'd, to thy grief, by the style of her giving,</l>
<l>Virtuosos have little esteem for the living.</l>

<stage>Mr. Beril <hi>and</hi> Mr. Cycle.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>Well, my worthy old friend, I rejoice you are here,</l>
<l>And that now you are known to that excellent peer;</l>
<l>Who, free from all pride, affectation, and vanity,</l>
<l>Unites useful virtue to pleasing urbanity;</l>
<l>Plain, simple, sincere, yet of judgment refin'd,</l>
<l>And fond of the arts, as they're friends to mankind;</l>
<l>Ennobled much less by his birth than his spirit,</l>
<l>The model of Honor, and patron of Merit!</l>
<l>But how have you done for this age? and what plan,</l>
<l>For the profit of science, or service of man,</l>
<l>Brings you now from your fav'rite sequester'd retreat?</l>
<l>Whate'er the occasion, I'm glad that we meet;</l>
<l>Tho' I meant to be with you ere next summer's sun.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>I know, my dear Beril, that you are not one</l>
<l>Whose welcome will suddenly sink into sorrow,</l>
<l>When I tell you, I now visit London to borrow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>If I'm able to levy the sum you require,</l>
<l>The world can scarce give me a pleasure much higher,</l>
<l>Than that of assisting a friend, to whose mind</l>
<l>I have infinite debts of a far deeper kind.</l>
<l>I can never forget what I owe to your care,</l>
<l>In the frenzy of desolate love and despair;</l>
<l><pb n="38" facs="36"/>When my reason had yielded to passion's wild strife,</l>
<l>Your friendship alone reconcil'd me to life.</l>
<l>But tell me, dear Cycle, what sum will suffice?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>You must know, I have lately been led to devise</l>
<l>A scheme for the poor—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>My dear friend, at your leisure</l>
<l>I'll hear your benevolent projects with pleasure;</l>
<l>But farther discourse you must let me prevent,</l>
<l>On the source of your wants, till I know their extent;</l>
<l>For indeed I can't rest, till I'm happily sure</l>
<l>That whatever you wish I have means to procure.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>Not to keep you in doubt, then, my dear ardent friend,</l>
<l>Two thousand, I fancy, will answer my end:</l>
<l>The one I am promis'd to-day from Bijou;</l>
<l>For the other, I own, I've depended on you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>And why not allow me to furnish the whole?—</l>
<l>Poor Bijou has a wife with no liberal soul;</l>
<l>If any demur in that quarter you see,</l>
<l>I entreat you to take all you wish for of me.</l>
<l>But of this more anon—here is Careless return'd.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Mr. Beril, Mr. Cycle, <hi>and</hi> Careless.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>Well! my worthy philosopher, a'n't you concern'd</l>
<l>To find our friend still unsupply'd with a wife,</l>
<l>Thus form'd as he is for the conjugal life?</l>
<l>As you're fond of new schemes for the good of the nation,</l>
<l>I'll recommend one to your consideration;</l>
<l><pb n="39" facs="37"/>To revive wedded love, that old, obsolete passion,</l>
<l>And bring honest Hymen again into fashion!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>In truth, my dear Tom, I am quite of your mind,</l>
<l>There is no better scheme for the good of mankind;</l>
<l>And nothing, I know, that could give it more weight</l>
<l>Than the grace which our friend would bestow on that state.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>You are merry, good friends!—I subscribe to your joke—</l>
<l>My gravity's fit for the conjugal yoke!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>I am serious, indeed, and have often declar'd,</l>
<l>That had I a sister, for wedlock prepar'd,</l>
<l>Of all men in the world, if you'd deign to embrace her,</l>
<l>In your arms it would make me most happy to place her.</l>
<l>But you're courted too much to be easily won;</l>
<l>He, whom many are fond of, can fix upon none.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>Indeed, my dear Tom, you are wrong on this theme.—</l>
<l>In return for a proof of your cordial esteem,</l>
<l>I'll tell you the reason, with frankness and truth,</l>
<l>Why no nymph has supply'd the lost love of my youth:</l>
<l>There is one, whose mild virtue and elegant grace,</l>
<l>The dear girl I deplore in my heart might replace;</l>
<l>But my fortune's too humble for her rank of life,</l>
<l>Tho' she may be <hi>your sister,</hi> she can't be <hi>my wife.</hi></l>

<l>Would you wed Lady Frances?</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="40" facs="38"/>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>You are right, my dear friend;—it was that very thought</l>
<l>Led my heart to attach itself more than it ought:</l>
<l>But my reason considers her rank and her station,</l>
<l>And forbids me to form any rash expectation.</l>
<l>Nor would I attempt to engage her affection,</l>
<l>Without the least hope of our happy connection.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARELESS.</speaker>
<l>More honor than foresight you shew by this strain.</l>
<l>Be bold!—there is nothing <hi>you</hi> may not attain.—</l>

<l>An exquisite Titian:</l>
<l>You never saw one in such brilliant condition.</l>

<l>And what is the subject?</l>
</sp>

<l>How chaste the design! yet the colours how warm!</l>
<l>What tints in each face! and what life in each form!</l>

<l>Not a soul here has seen it, except a poor Peer,</l>

<l>And betray a good Earl, with more gusto than cash.—</l>

<l>And buy some companions besides, if I had 'em;</l>
<l>But I'll leave it with you for eight hundred, dear Madam.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Eight hundred!—Sure, Varnish, that sum is too much.</l>

<l>There is not, I know, such a gem in the nation;</l>
<l>And Italy has not a brighter, I'm sure.</l>

<l>Well! I own, Mr. Varnish, your picture is fine.—</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mr. Bijou.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>My dear, here's a sight!</l>
<l>You are luckily come to complete my delight.</l>
<l>Mr. Varnish has been so exceedingly kind,</l>
<l>As he knows on a Titian I've long set my mind,</l>
<l>To bring me the finest I ever survey'd:</l>
<l>And as we have often, befriended his trade,</l>
<l>He offers to leave it a bargain with us.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Its merit or price it is vain to discuss:</l>
<l>Tho' the picture possesses so tempting an air,</l>
<l>At present, my dear, I've no money to spare.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Mr. Varnish, pray step in the parlour below!</l>
<l>Our final resolve you shall presently know.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. VARNISH.</speaker>
<l>Dear Madam, for hours I'll wait on your pleasure;</l>
<l>And I beg you will note all its beauties at leisure.</l>
<pb n="44" facs="42"/><stage>(Aside, as he goes out.)</stage>
<l>Now success to the sex!—Be this struggle more glorious!</l>
<l>May the Joseph be kind! and the Lady victorious!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>My dearest, you'll not let the picture depart,</l>
<l>When you see it has taken such hold on my heart!—</l>
<l>I really can't rest, till a Titian we've got,</l>
<l>That <hi>we</hi> may have something Lord Seewell has <hi>not.</hi></l>
<l>And as we expect him, you know, here to-night,</l>
<l>I would shew him this piece with triumphant delight.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>I love to indulge all your wishes, my dear;</l>
<l>But I'm quite out of cash.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Nay! Bijou! I am clear</l>
<l>You have now all I want in your pocket.—Come! come!</l>
<l>I know you went out to receive a large sum;</l>
<l>And still have it about you.—I vow I will look.—</l>
<l>Here it is!—here are notes in this little red book.</l>

<l>Here are ten, I declare, of an hundred apiece!—</l>
<l>I'll take just enough, and restore you the rest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>I can't suffer this freedom, my dear, I protest;</l>
<l>For the notes are not mine, they belong to a friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>To a friend!—O! I guess, Sir, to whom you would lend.</l>
<l><pb n="45" facs="43"/>Your sly-looking guest, Mr. Cycle's the man;</l>
<l>I know he was here on a borrowing plan.</l>
<l>Throw your thousand away on a charity bubble!</l>
<l>And leave your poor wife to vexation and trouble!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Nay! my dear, be not vex'd!—you have misunderstood:</l>
<l>The sum will be safe, and the interest good.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>And what is the pitiful profit you'll raise,</l>
<l>Compar'd to the transport with which we should gaze</l>
<l>On the picture my fondness would have you possess,</l>
<l>For reasons the purest that wife can profess?</l>
<l>Unkind as you are!—I have reasons above</l>
<l>Even profit and pleasure—the reasons of love.</l>
<l>'Tis my aim, by this modest production of art,</l>
<l>To strengthen your virtue and chasten your heart.</l>
<l>If you daily survey an example so bright,</l>
<l>This model of continence ever in sight,</l>
<l>No naughty young women will tempt you to wander,</l>
<l>But your truth and your love will grow firmer and fonder.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>What a tender idea!— how virtuously kind!</l>
<l>What affection and taste! by each other refin'd!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>But if for a poor and a foolish projector,</l>
<l>You can thwart a fond wife, and afflict and neglect her—</l>
<l>Go! go! I shall weep, while abroad you may roam,</l>
<l>That your charity has no beginning at home.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>It begins, and shall end there.—I'm melted, my dear!—</l>
<l>You may keep all the notes!—Let me kiss off that tear!</l>

<l>Such virtuous endearments what heart could resist?</l>
<l>Yet I fear by poor Cycle this sum will be miss'd.</l>
<l>And what shall I say for the failure?—In sooth,</l>
<l>I think 'twill be fairest to tell him the truth:</l>
<l>And, sage as he is, he perhaps too has felt</l>
<l>That Gold, at the breath of a woman, will melt.—</l>

<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Mr. Cycle, you're come, and I'm really confus'd;</l>
<l>But I know the mischance will by you be excus'd.</l>
<l>In notes I had got you the thousand complete,</l>
<l>They were all in this pocket—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>The thieves of the street</l>
<l>Have not pick'd it, I hope, in the bustle of strife?</l>
</sp>

<l>I am happy the sum is so justly bestow'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>I know you'll forgive, when I come to explain.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>

<l><pb n="47" facs="45"/>And assure you, with truth, that I now really come</l>
<l>As ready to quit, as to take up the sum;</l>
<l>Since Beril's so kind, that, without my desire,</l>
<l>He has offer'd me all that my wants can require.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>I protest, I am glad you have found such a friend;</l>
<l>But if you hereafter should wish me to lend,</l>

<l>Your worthy friend Beril to-night we shall see;</l>
<l>And Seewell, in gusto the first of our Earls,</l>
<l>Will be here with his daughters, two delicate girls!</l>
<l>To prove, my good friend, your forgiveness is hearty,</l>
<l>Let me hope you will kindly make one of the party!</l>
</sp>

<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Well!—I am griev'd, I must say,</l>

<l>But to tell you the truth, when for these gala nights</l>
<l>My wife is preparing to shew her fine sights,</l>
<l>She spends so much time in adjusting her shelves,</l>
<l>That we take a cold snap in the kitchen ourselves.</l>
<l>So I'm sure you'll excuse it.</l>

<head>SCENE I.</head>
<stage>Lord Seewell <hi>and</hi> Lady Harriot.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>DEAR Papa, don't betray me!—Her delicate mind</l>
<l>Would be wounded, I know, and would think me unkind;</l>
<l>So far from allowing, what now I impart,</l>
<l>She herself little knows the true state of her heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, my dear, I with pleasure survey</l>
<l>The sisterly fondness you warmly display.</l>
<l>But you, who for others so sensibly feel,</l>
<l>May here be the dupe of affectionate zeal;</l>
<l>And I hope you're mistaken.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>My dear Sir, observe!</l>
<l>You may trace her attachment in every nerve:</l>
<l><pb n="49" facs="47"/>If I name Mr. Beril in some idle tale,</l>
<l>Poor Fanny will blush, and as often turn pale.</l>
<l>In his absence still more and more pensive she grows,</l>
<l>Yet thinks not from whence her uneasiness flows.</l>
<l>And when he returns, tho' her pleasure is meek,</l>
<l>Yet the glow of content may be seen on her cheek;</l>
<l>And her heart, as if fully consol'd by his sight,</l>
<l>Appears to repose in a tranquil delight.</l>
<l>Dear Papa, you'll perceive, if you'll open your eyes,</l>
<l>That from none but herself she her love can disguise.</l>
<l>One other exception perhaps we may find,</l>
<l>As I think Mr. Beril is equally blind,</l>
<l>And robb'd, like herself, of the talent of seeing,</l>
<l>By that diffident love, which denies it own being.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>I hope this attachment, which neither has shewn,</l>
<l>Exists, my good girl, in your fancy alone.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>Why so, my dear Sir?—Should it prove, as you fear,</l>
<l>I hope, dear Papa, that you won't be severe.</l>
<l>Consider the delicate frame of my sister!</l>
<l>But I know you've a heart that can never resist her,</l>
<l>If you once clearly see she has fixt her affection,</l>
<l>Tho' she own not her wishes for such a connection;</l>
<l>As you know that her nature's so modest and meek,</l>
<l>She would die from concealment before she would speak.</l>
<l>I have strength to encounter the crosses of life,</l>
<l>And to make my part good, as a daughter or wife:</l>
<l>But our gentle sweet Frances is ill-form'd to bear</l>
<l>The undeserv'd load of vexation and care;</l>
<l><pb n="50" facs="48"/>And therefore should wed, unregardful of pelf,</l>
<l>A husband as tender and mild as herself.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Your reasoning, I think, is not perfectly just.</l>
<l>In the kindness of Beril perhaps I might trust;</l>
<l>But the motive you urge for this union, my dear,</l>
<l>Is what, I confess, would awaken my fear.</l>
<l>As you say, your mild sister should never be harrass'd</l>
<l>By those various ills with which life is embarrass'd,</l>
<l>I should guard her from all the vexations that wait</l>
<l>On a liberal mind with a narrow estate:</l>
<l>And if Beril had thoughts of becoming my son,</l>
<l>Had I <hi>not</hi> more objections, yet this must be one.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>I'll remove it, my Lord, for indeed this is all:</l>
<l>As you think they'll be pinch'd by an income too small,</l>
<l>You shall add to their fortune, and large it will be,</l>
<l>Two thirds of the portion you've destin'd for me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Dear Harriot! I'm charm'd with thy soul, I confess;</l>
<l>Thou'rt a generous girl—to a noble excess.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>To that name, dear Papa, I've no title, indeed,</l>
<l>As I only give up what I never can need.</l>
<l>In your house all my wants will, I know, be supply'd;</l>
<l>And if I should leave it, as Careless's bride,</l>
<l>The liberal heir of so large an estate</l>
<l>Will not grieve that my fortune has sunk in its weight.</l>
<l>Or should my swain frown at the change in my purse,</l>
<l>He may e'en take old Themis for better for worse;</l>
<l>For tho', I confess, he has won my regard,</l>
<l>Yet the knot of my love is not twisted so hard,</l>
<l><pb n="51" facs="49"/>But 'twill slip in a moment, if ever I see</l>
<l>That he's rather more fond of my purse than of me,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>'Tis a pity, the friendly illusions of youth</l>
<l>Cannot instantly turn into substance and truth.</l>
<l>Your affectionate fancy, my dear, is delighted</l>
<l>With the dream of beholding two persons united,</l>
<l>Whom you fondly suppose only form'd for each other.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>I should like Mr. Beril, I own, for my brother,</l>
<l>Because I'm convinc'd, that no mortal on earth,</l>
<l>In manners, in temper, in taste, and in worth,</l>
<l>Is form'd so exactly to suit such a wife.</l>
<l>On their lasting attachment I'd venture my life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Your warm heart, my good girl, your young judgment deceives,</l>
<l>And what the first wishes the second believes.</l>
<l>Dear Harriot, to <hi>this</hi> fancied match there may be</l>
<l>Many bars, which your eyes are unable to see:</l>
<l>A mistress conceal'd with a young little fry—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY HARRIOT.</speaker>
<l>Should an angel declare it, the fact I'd deny;</l>
<l>For had Beril been loaded with such a connection,</l>
<l>In his eyes I had never perceiv'd his affection.</l>
<l>But I'll presently solve any doubts of this kind,</l>
<l>As I'm soon to be told the true state of his mind;</l>
<l>For Careless has promis'd—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>O fie! my dear, fie!</l>
<l>Your intemperate zeal has now risen too high.</l>
<l><pb n="52" facs="50"/>I am really concern'd at your great indiscretion.</l>

<l>No! not one single hint, that could truly discover</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>No!—with terrors too lively your bosom is fill'd.</l>
<l>My dear, how you tremble!—But I was to blame,</l>
<l>To raise this alarm in your delicate frame.</l>

<l>You will see by this letter.—

<speaker>LADY FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>How painful to him must the exigence be,</l>
<l>Which extorts from his hand the agreement I see!</l>
<l>How cruel! for him to relinquish a treasure,</l>
<l>Whence his elegant spirit deriv'd so much pleasure!</l>
<l>But I trust, dear Papa, that your generous mind</l>
<l>Will not now press the bargain he once has declin'd;</l>
<l>And scorning to profit by any distress,</l>
<l>Will not catch at the gem he still ought to possess.</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mrs. Bijou, <hi>in great Agitation.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>What's the matter, my love?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>O, my dear, such a blow!</l>
<l>I really had swoon'd, if vexation and wrath</l>
<l>Had not quicken'd my spirits, to scold at the Goth.</l>
<l>That awkward old Joan!—an unmannerly minx!</l>
<l>Has knock'd off the nipple, my dear, from a Sphinx;</l>
<l>And now on our chimney it cannot be plac'd,</l>
<l>With a wound so indelicate maim'd and disgrac'd.</l>
<l>But I've happily got these two Griffins of gold,</l>
<l>In the room of the Sphinxes, our candles to hold.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>My dear, the exchange is most lucky and right,</l>
<l>For a Sphinx is an awkward dispenser of light;</l>
<l>But whether your Griffin's of gold or of copper,</l>
<l>A flame from his mouth is exceedingly proper.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>By your lessons, my love, I improve in Virtù:</l>
<l>All the gusto I have, I have gather'd from you.—</l>
<l>I have fixt the Great Mummy, my dear, to the wall,</l>
<l>Lest the pert Lady Harriot should give him a fall:</l>
<l>She'd be glad to throw down my old king, out of spite;</l>
<l>And I would not be vext in our triumph to-night.</l>
<l>I know our new picture will stir up her gall,</l>
<l>And this Titian will make us the envy of all.</l>
<l><pb n="57" facs="55"/>My dear, don't you think it looks well by this light?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>The colours, indeed, are uncommonly bright.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>What a beautiful youth is this Joseph!—I swear,</l>
<l>I am more and more charm'd with his delicate air;</l>
<l>I delight in him more since I've found, dear Bijou,</l>
<l>That in one of his features he's very like you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Where can you, my dear, any likeness suppose?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>I protest he has got the true turn of your nose;</l>
<l>Not the aquiline curve, but a little Socratic:</l>
<l>And his eye flashes fire, that is chastly ecstatic.—</l>
<l>There's a rap at our door! and I hope my Lord's come.</l>
<l>If vexation and envy do not strike him dumb,</l>
<l>I think he'll harangue, like a critic of Greece,</l>
<l>On the exquisite charms of this beautiful piece!</l>
<l>I long to behold how he's touch'd by the sight:</l>
<l>But I know that his envy will sink his delight.</l>
<l>The moment he sees it, he'll think his luck cruel,</l>
<l>In missing so precious a cabinet jewel.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mr. Beril <hi>and</hi> Mr. Cycle.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Dear Cycle, I take this exceedingly kind;</l>
<l>And I hope you've not left your Cremona behind.</l>
<l>In your presence to-night I most truly rejoice,</l>
<l>And shall call for the aid of your hand and your voice,</l>
<l>(As my wife gives a snug little concert below)</l>
<l>When you've seen what her upper apartments can shew.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="58" facs="56"/>
<speaker>MR. CYCLE.</speaker>
<l>You may freely command me, my friend, as you please.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>You're a judge, Mr. Beril, of treasures like these;</l>
<l>And I'm eager to shew you a Titian, that's new</l>
<l>Since we last had the joy of a visit from you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>The story is told, Ma'am, with striking expression.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Don't you envy my husband this brilliant possession?</l>
<l>I thought you'd burst forth into rapturous praise;</l>
<l>But with no keen delight on this picture you gaze!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>To confess, Ma'am, the truth, I'm a whimsical being,</l>
<l>And a subject like this I've no pleasure in seeing.</l>
<l>On <hi>your</hi> lovely sex 'tis a satire most bitter,</l>
<l>That ill-nature may laugh at, and levity titter:</l>
<l>But I'm griev'd, when an artist has lavish'd his care</l>
<l>On a story that seems a disgrace to the Fair.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Our sex's chief lustre, I own, it obscures:</l>
<l>But think what a lesson it offers to yours!</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Lady Harriot, Lady Frances, Lord Seewell, <hi>and</hi> Mr. Careless.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>My dear Lord, I this instant was wishing for you.</l>
<l>Your voice is decisive in points of Virtù;</l>
<l>And you're come in the moment to end an odd strife,</l>
<l>In a matter of taste about Potiphar's wife.—</l>
<l>Should her story be painted?—We want your decision;</l>
<l>And here is the picture that caus'd our division.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="59" facs="57"/>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Ha! my poor old acquaintance!—But how, dear Bijou,</l>
<l>How the deuce could this picture find favor with you?</l>
<l>I hope that rogue Varnish has play'd you no trick.—</l>
<l>You have paid no great price—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>I am cut to the quick!</l>
<l>Sure, my Lord, you ne'er look'd on this picture before?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Dear Madam! 'tis one that I turn'd out of door;</l>
<l>And, as I may aid you to 'scape from a fraud,</l>
<l>I'll proceed to inform you, I bought it abroad,</l>
<l>To relieve the distress of an indigent youth,</l>
<l>Who copied old Masters with spirit and truth;</l>
<l>And when it came home, as I valu'd it not,</l>
<l>My steward, by chance, this gay furniture got.</l>
<l>To a new house of his it has lately been carried;</l>
<l>And as your friend Varnish his daughter has married,</l>
<l>I suppose the sly rogue by this picture has try'd,</l>
<l>To increase the small fortune he gain'd with his bride.</l>
<l>Search the garment of Joseph! you'll find on its hem,</l>
<l>And within a dark fold, the two letters T. M.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>Aye! there is the mark! —we are cheated, we're plunder'd.</l>
<l>That infamous villain, to ask me eight hundred!—</l>
<l>But the law shall restore it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>See! Mrs. Bijou,</l>
<l>See the fruits of my hasty indulgence to you!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>Chear up, my old friend!—'Tis my wish, that this night</l>
<l>May be witness to nothing but peace and delight.</l>
<l><pb n="60" facs="58"/>I'll engage to make Varnish your money restore;</l>
<l>And perhaps this adventure may save you much more.</l>
<l>All we old connoisseurs, if the truth we would own,</l>
<l>Have, at times, been outwitted with canvas or stone:</l>
<l>But here's one, whose example our tribe now invites</l>
<l>To correct our mistakes, and improve our delights.</l>
<l>Here's Beril, tho' blest with a treasure most rare,</l>
<l>That with few works of art will admit of compare,</l>
<l>Gives up the proud joys, that on such wealth attend,</l>
<l>For the nobler delight of assisting a friend!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>My Lord! you amaze me; how could you divine?—</l>
<l>O, Careless! your zeal has betray'd my design.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>You have fixt on the traitor, yet are not aware,</l>
<l>That you're almost involv'd in a dangerous snare:</l>
<l>But I'll shew you this traitor's accomplice, my friend,</l>
<l>And tell you what mischief these plotters intend.</l>
<l>You must know, Tom and Harriot in concert pursue</l>
<l>Their dark machinations 'gainst Frances and you:</l>
<l>They have sworn you've a tender esteem for each other,</l>
<l>Which you both have in modesty labour'd to smother.</l>
<l>If their charge can be prov'd, I your freedom restrain,</l>
<l>And sentence you both to the conjugal chain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>O, my Lord! that I love Lady Frances, is true;</l>
<l>Yet I could not avow it to her, or to you:</l>
<l>But to force my confession, such means you employ,</l>
<l>I almost may call them the torture of joy.</l>
<l>I'm o'erwhelm'd with surprize, with delight, and with dread,</l>
<l>Lest I falsely have heard the kind things you have said.</l>
<l><pb n="61" facs="59"/>Speak! my dear Lady Frances, my anguish relieve!</l>
<l>Does this tumult of hope my wild fancy deceive?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADY FRANCES.</speaker>
<l>I so long have my father's indulgence confest,</l>
<l>That against his decrees I shall never protest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>O, how shall I thank thee, dear pride of my life!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>By cherishing still in the mind of your wife,</l>
<l>Such generous feelings as <hi>you</hi> have display'd.—</l>
<l>From my hand, my dear Beril, receive the kind maid!</l>
<l>Your statue is not more indebted to art,</l>
<l>Than she is to nature for moulding her heart.</l>
<l>They both shall be yours; both the statue and bride!</l>
<l>And the wants of your friend shall no less be supply'd.—</l>
<l>Being free from one modish and wealth—wasting vice,</l>
<l>From those pests of our order, the turf and the dice,</l>
<l>I enjoy, my dear children, the fortunate power,</l>
<l>Of securing your bliss by an affluent dower.</l>
<l>Your quiet shall ne'er by your income be hurt,</l>
<l>Which shall equal your wish, tho' below your desert.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BERIL.</speaker>
<l>Of your kindness, my Lord, I so feel the excess,</l>
<l>That my voice cannot speak what my heart would express.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>I am charm'd, my dear Lord, by your choice of a son.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LORD SEEWELL.</speaker>
<l>I know, my old friend, you'll approve what I've done.</l>
<l>You and I, dear Bijou, wanting proper correction,</l>
<l>Have on vanity lavished the dues of affection.</l>
<l>We have both squander'd cash on too many a whim;</l>
<l>But in taste let us take a new lesson from him!</l>
<l><pb n="62" facs="60"/>And rate our improvements in real Virtù,</l>
<l>By the generous acts he may teach us to do;</l>
<l>To remember this truth is the connoisseur's duty;</l>
<l>"A benevolent deed is the essence of beauty."</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. BIJOU.</speaker>
<l>I confess, I too oft have been vanity's fool;</l>
<l>But shall hope to grow wise, my good Lord, in your school,</l>
<l>And, as mirth should be coupled with wisdom, I'll go</l>
<l>And see if the fiddles are ready below.

<l>To-night, my dear Madam, you must not look grave;</l>

<l>I promise to make him your money refund.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MRS. BIJOU.</speaker>

<l>What I owe to you, Careless, this fair one attests:</l>

<l>Now fill your kind heart with complete exultation.</l>

<l>The warm blaze of our joy, I assure you, dear brother,</l>
<l>With the cold damp of prudery I will not smother,</l>
<l>Your friend has for you play'd so feeling a part,</l>
<l>I confess, I am charm'd with his spirit and heart.</l>
<l>As in law and long courtship he likes not to drudge,</l>
<l>I will make him at once my comptroller and judge.</l>

<l>For sealing, dear Tom, you may fix your own day,</l>

<l>May we all think this day the best day of our life!</l>
<l>It will prove so, I'm sure, both to me and my wife.</l>
