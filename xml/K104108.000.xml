<head>PROLOGUE,</head>
<byline><hi>Written by</hi> W. T. FITZGERALD, Esq SPOKEN BY MR. BETTERTON.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>IN ev'ry age, the trump of deathless fame</l>
<l>Proclaims the warrior's and the poet's name;</l>
<l>Painting and sculpture all the pow'rs combine,</l>
<l>And <hi>laurels</hi> deck the bard's and hero's shrine.</l>
<l>No further can the parallel extend,</l>
<l>The poet's honours on success depend;</l>
<l>While Fortune's frown can ne'er molest the brave,</l>
<l>Nor blast the laurel springing from his grave.</l>
<l>An equal wreath impartial Fame supplies,</l>
<l>To him who conquers, and to him who dies;</l>
<l>For British valor was displayed, not more</l>
<l>On Nile's proud flood, than Helder's barren shore!</l>
<l>The chance of war the bravest may control,</l>
<l>But leaves untouch'd the courage of the soul;</l>
<l>And England gives her heroes, ever dear!</l>
<l>The shout of triumph, or the starting tear.</l>
<l>Not so the Bard—with him success is all!</l>
<l>When Fortune frowns, his air-built castles fall:</l>
<l>But if she smiles, he sails with prosperous breeze,</l>
<l>Like the small Nautilus o'er Summer seas;</l>
<l>Whose little oars on ocean's bosom sweep,</l>
<l>Fearless of all the monsters of the deep.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<stage>(After a pause.)</stage>
<l>Oft at <hi>this Bar,</hi> our Author has been <hi>tried,</hi></l>
<l>Where English Judges take the pris'ner's side!</l>
<l>Guilty of faults no doubt he will appear,</l>
<l>But human errors find acquittal here—</l>
<l>Where e'en the friendless always meet support,</l>
<l>From honest Juries, and an upright Court.</l>
<l>Critics, who rule o'er politics and plays,</l>
<l>If you are adverse, vain the poet's lays!</l>
<l>"You, who with equal hands the balance hold,</l>
<l>"Whose just decision ne'er was bought or sold,</l>
<l>"But who to ev'ry candidate dispense</l>
<l>"His lot of humour, and his share of sense,"</l>
<l>Protect our Author on the coming day,</l>
<l>And though you damn the Prologue—spare the Play:</l>
<l>To your decree each Dramatist must bow,</l>
<l>Give but your aid, and that will "Speed the Plough!"</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dame.</speaker>
<p>No, Tummas; but I have brought a rare wadget of news with me. First and foremost I saw such a mort of coaches, servants, and waggons, all belonging to Sir Abel Handy, and all coming to the Castle—and a handsome young man, dressed all in lace, pull'd off his hat to me, and said— Mrs. Ashfield, do me the honour of presenting that letter to your husband.—So, there he stood without his hat—Oh, Tummas, had you seen how Mrs. Grundy looked!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ash.</speaker>
<p>Dom Mrs. Grundy—be quiet, and let I read, woolye? <stage>(reads)</stage> "My dear Farmer" <stage>(taking off his hat)</stage>, Thankye, Zur—zame to you we all my heart and soul—" My dear Farmer"—</p>

What pretty writing, beant it? all as strait as thof it were ploughed— Surprised to hear that in a few hours I shall embrace you—Nelly, who formerly was our servant, has fortunately married Sir Abel Handy Bart.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dame.</speaker>
<p>Handy Bart—Pugh! Bart. stands for Baronight, mun.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ash.</speaker>
<p>Likely, likely—Drabbit it, only to think of the zwaps and changes of this world!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dame.</speaker>
<p>Our Nelly married to a great Baronet! I wonder, Tummas, what Mrs. Grundy will say?</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Everg.</speaker>
<p>Good day, honest Thomas.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ash.</speaker>
<p>Dame, be quiet, woolye now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Everg.</speaker>
<p>No, no—The news is, that my master, Sir Philip Blandford, after having been abroad for twenty years, returns this day to the Castle; and that the reason of his coming, is to marry his only daughter to the son of Sir Abel Handy, I think they call him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dame.</speaker>
<p>As sure as twopence, that is Nelly's husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Everg.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!—Well, Sir Abel and his son will be here immediately; and, Farmer, you must attend them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ash.</speaker>
<p>Likely, likely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Everg.</speaker>
<p>And, mistress, come and lend us a hand at the Castle, will you?—Ah, twenty long years since I have seen Sir Philip—Poor Gentleman! bad, bad health—worn almost to the grave, I am told.—What a lad do I remember him—till that dreadful— <stage>(checking himself.)</stage> But where is Henry? I must see him—must caution him <stage>(a gun is discharged at a distance).</stage> That's his gun, I suppose— he is not far then—Poor Henry!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dame.</speaker>
<p>Poor Henry! I like that indeed! What, though he be nobody knows who, there is not a girl in the parish that is not ready to pull caps for
<pb n="9" facs="8"/>him—The Miss Grundys, genteel as they think themselves, would be glad to snap at him—If he were our own, we could not love him better.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Everg.</speaker>
<p>And he deserves to be loved—Why, he's as handsome as a peach tree in blossom; and his mind is as free from weeds as my favourite carnation bed. But, Thomas, run to the Castle, and receive Sir Abel and his son.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ash.</speaker>
<p>I wool, I wool—Zo, good day, <stage>(bowing.)</stage> Let every man make his bow, and behave pratty— that's what I say—Missus, do'ye shew un Sue's letter, woolye? Doye letten see how pratty she do write feyther.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Dame.</speaker>
<p>Now Tummas is gone, I'll tell you such a story about Mrs. Grundy—But come, step in, you must needs be weary; and I am sure a mug of harvest beer, sweetened with a hearty welcome, will refresh you.</p>

<p>Sir, I heard you were but four days married, and I would not interrupt your honeymoon.</p>

<p>Oh! so then my honored Mamma was the servant of this tittering gentleman—I say, father, perhaps she has not lost the tightish prattle he speaks of.</p>

<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>My dear boy, come here—Prattle! I say, did you ever live next door to a pewterer's?— that's all—you understand me—did you ever hear a dozen fire-engines full gallop?—were you ever at Billingsgate in the sprat season?—or—</p>

<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>Nay, don't laugh, Bob.</p>

<p>Indeed, Sir, you think of it too seriously. The storm, I dare say, soon blows over.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>Soon! You know what a trade wind is, don't you, Bob? why, she thinks no more of the latter end of her speech, than she does of the latter end of her life—</p>

<p>I beg your pardon—but how in the name of Babel did she wheedle you into matrimony?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>Why, she dealt with me as the devil deals with a witch—humoured me for a time, that I might be her slave for ever! I thought I was marrying a notable woman, who would have eased my head of part of its burthen: — instead of which—</p>

<p>True, my good old friend; and if the knowledge of who I am can only be obtained at

<p>Come, come, no more of this.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>HANDY, jun.</speaker>
<p>A SINGULAR situation this my old Dad has placed me in; brought me here to marry a woman of fashion and beauty, while I have been professing and I've a notion feeling the most ardent love for the pretty Susan Ashfield—Propriety says, take Miss Blandford—Love says, take Susan—Fashion says, take both—but would Susan consent to such an arrangement?—and if she refused, would I consent to part with her? Oh time enough to put that question when the previous one is disposed of— <stage>(<hi>seeing</hi> DAME)</stage> How do you do? How do you do?—Making lace I perceive—Is it a common employment here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dame.</speaker>
<p>Oh! no, Sir, nobody can make it in these parts but myself!—Mrs. Grundy indeed pretends—but, poor woman! she knows no more of it than you do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="23" facs="22"/>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Than I do! that's vastly well— My dear Madam, I passed two months at Mechlin for the express purpose.</p>

<speaker>Dame.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>

<p>You don't do it right—now I can do it much better than that. Give me leave, and I'll shew you the true Mechlin method <stage>(turns the cushion round, kneels down and begins working).</stage> First you see, so—then, so—</p>

<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>Is not she, Bob?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun. </speaker>
<stage>(to <hi>Miss B.</hi>)</stage>
<p>In your journey from the coast, I conclude you took London in your way? Hush!</p>
<stage>(<hi>to</hi> DAME.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Oh no, Sir, I could not so soon venture into the <hi>beau monde,</hi> a stranger just arrived from Germany—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>The very reason—the most fashionable introduction possible! but I perceive, Sir, you have here imitated other German importations, and only restored to us our native excellence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>I assure you, Sir, I am eager to seize my birth-right, the pure and envied immunities of an English woman!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Then I trust, Madam, you will be patriot enough to agree with me, that as a nation is poor, whose only wealth is importation—that therefore the humble native artist may ever hope to obtain from his countrymen those fostering smiles, without which genius must sicken and industry decay. But it requires no <hi>valet de place</hi> to conduct you through the purlieus of fashion, for now the way of the world is, for every one to pursue their own way, and following the fashion is differing as much as possible from the rest of your acquaintance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>But surely, Sir, there is some distinguishing feature by which the votaries of fashion are known?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Yes; but that varies extremely— sometimes fashionable celebrity depends on a high waist—sometimes on a low carriage—sometimes on high play, and sometimes on low breeding—last winter it rested solely on green peas!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="25" facs="24"/>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Green peas!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Green peas!—that Lady was the most enchanting who could bring the greatest quantity of green peas to her table at Christmas! the struggle was tremendous! Mrs. Rowley Powley had the best of it by five pecks and a half, but it having been unfortunately proved, that at her ball there was room to dance and eat conveniently—that no lady received a black eye, and no coachman was killed, the thing was voted decent and comfortable, and scouted accordingly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Is comfort then incompatible with fashion?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Certainly!—Comfort in high life would be as preposterous as a lawyer's bag crammed with truth, or his wig decorated with coquelicot ribbons! No—it is not comfort and selection that is sought, but numbers and confusion! So that a fashionable party resembles Smithfield market, only a good one when plentifully stocked—and ladies are reckoned by the score like sheep, and their husbands by droves like horned cattle!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha! and the conversation—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Oh! like the assembly—confused, vapid, and abundant; as How do, Ma'am!—no accident at the door?—he, he!—Only my carriage broke to pieces!—I hope you had not your pocket picked!—Won't you sit down to faro?—"Have you many to-night?" —"A few, about six hundred!"—Were you at Lady Overall's?—Oh yes; a delicious crowd and plenty of peas, he, he!—and thus runs the fashionable race.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and a precious run it is—full gallop all the way: first they run on—then their fortune is run through—then bills are run up—
<pb n="26" facs="25"/>then they are run hard—then they've a run of luck —then they run out, and then they run away!— But I'll forgive fashion all it's follies in consideration of one of its blessed laws.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>What may that be?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>That husband and wife must never be seen together.</p>

<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>His spirits are extremely depressed, and since we arrived here this morning his dejection has dreadfully increased.</p>

<p>I suppose she has found out the use of money.</p>

<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>Yes; I'll do her the justice to say she encourages trade.—Why, do you know, Bob, my best coal-pit won't find her in white muslins—round her neck hangs a hundred acres at least; my noblest oaks have made wigs for her; my fat oxen have dwindled into Dutch pugs, and white mice; my India bonds are transmuted into shawls and otto of roses; and a magnificent mansion has shrunk into a diamond snuff-box.</p>

<p>My dear Sir, if there be anything on earth I can do, it is that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>

<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>You don't say so! What a clever fellow he is—I say, Bob, if you would—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>No; I can't condescend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>Condescend! why not?—much more creditable, let me tell you, than galloping a maggot for a thousand, or eating a live cat, or any other fashionable achievement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>So it is—Egad! I will—I'll carry off the prize of industry.</p>

<p>But should you lose, Bod.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>I lose! that's vastly well!</p>

<p>True, with my curricle plough you could hardly fail.</p>

<p>With my superior skill, Dad— Then, I say, how the newspapers will teem with the account.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Then you are rich—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Abel.</speaker>
<p>So much the worse; for had I been poor she would not have married me. But I say, Bob, if you gain the prize, I'll have a patent for my plough.</p>

<p>Madam, I beg pardon, but nobody knows about his parentage; and when it is mentioned, poor boy! he takes on sadly—He has lived at our house ever since we had the farm, and we have had an allowance for him—small enough to be sure—but, good lad! he was always welcome to share what we had.</p>

<p>I dare say he is, Sir; but on this occa sion, I think I ought to dance with the young man who gained the prize—I think it would be most pleasant—most proper, I mean; and I am glad you agree with me—So, Sir, if you'll accept my hand</p>
<stage>(HENRY <hi>takes it).</hi></stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Dear father! I came the moment I heard you wished to see me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="45" facs="44"/>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>My good child, thou art the sole support that props my feeble life. I fear my wish for thy company deprives thee of much pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Oh no! What pleasure can be equal to that of giving you happiness? Am I not rewarded in seeing your eyes beam with pleasure on me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>'Tis the pale reflection of the lustre I see sparkling there. My love! did you enjoy the scenes you beheld?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Greatly. How strongly they contrast with those we witnessed abroad!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>True. Happy country! which, in the midst of direful war can draw out its rustic train to join the festive dance, as securely as if peace again had blessed the world!—But tell me, did your lover gain the prize?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Yes, papa.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Few men of his rank—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Oh! you mean Mr. Handy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>No; he did not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Then, who did <hi>you</hi> mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Did you say lover? I—I mistook—No —a young man called Henry obtained the prize!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>And how did Mr. Handy succeed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Oh, it was so ridiculous! I will tell you, papa, what happened to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>To Mr. Handy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Yes; as soon as the contest was over Henry presented himself; I was surprized at seeing a young man so handsome and elegant as Henry is—then I placed the medal round Henry's neck, and I was told that poor Henry—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Henry!—So, my love! this is your account of Mr. Robert Handy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="46" facs="45"/>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Yes, papa—no, papa—he came afterwards, dressed so ridiculously that even Henry could not help smiling.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Henry again!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Then we had a dance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Of course you danced with your lover?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Yes, papa.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>How does Mr. Handy dance?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Oh! he did not dance till—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>You danced with your lover?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Yes—No, papa!—Somebody said (I don't know who) that I ought to dance with Henry, because—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Still Henry! Oh! some rustic boy. My dear child, you talk as if you loved this Henry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Oh! no, papa—and I am certain he don't love me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Yes, papa; for when he touched my hand, he trembled as if I terrified him; and instead of looking at me as you do, who I am sure love me, when our eyes met, he withdrew his and cast them on the ground.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>And these are the reasons which make you conclude he does not love you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Yes, papa.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>And probably you could adduce proof equally convincing that you don't love him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Oh yes—quite; for in the dance he sometimes paid attention to other young women, and I was so angry with him! Now, you know, papa, I love you—and I am sure I should not have been angry with you, had you done so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="47" facs="46"/>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>But one question more—Do you think Mr. Handy loves you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>I have never thought about it, papa.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>I am satisfied.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Yes; I knew I should convince you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Love! malign and subtle tyrant, how falsely art thou painted blind! 'Tis thy votaries are so; for what but blindness can prevent their seeing thy poisoned shaft, which is for ever doomed to rankle in the victim's heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Oh! now I am certain I am not in love; for I feel no rankling at my heart. I feel the softest, sweetest sensation I ever experienced. But, papa, you must come to the lawn. I don't-know why, but to-day Nature seems enchanting; the birds sing more sweetly, and the flowers give more perfume.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip </speaker>
<stage>(aside).</stage>
<p>Such was the day my youthful sancy pictured! How did it close?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>I promifed Henry your protection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! that was much. Well, I will see your rustic here. This infant passion must be crushed. Poor wench! some artless boy has caught thy infant fancy!—Thy arm, my child!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Have you not promised me the disposal of your hand?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Alas! my father! I didn't then know the difficulty of obedience!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Hear, then, the reasons why I demand compliance. You think I hold these rich estates—Alas, the shadow only, not the substance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Explain, my father!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>When I left my native country, I lest it with a heart lacerated by every wound that the falsehood of others or my own conscience could inflict. Hateful to myself, I became the victim of dissipation—I rushed to the gaming table, and soon became the dupe of villains.—My ample fortune
<pb n="51" facs="50"/>was lost; I detected one in the act of fraud, and having brought him to my feet, he confessed a plan had been laid for my ruin; that he was but an humble instrument; for that the man who, by his superior genius, stood posseffed of all the mortgages and securities I had given, was one Mortington.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>I have heard your name him before. Did you not know this Morrington?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>No; he, like his deeds, avoided the light—Ever dark, subtle, and mysterious. Collecting the scattered remnant of my fortune, I wandered wretched and desolare, till, in a peaceful village, I first beheld thy mother, humble in birth, but exalted in virtue. The morning after our marriage she received a packet, containing these words: The reward of virtuous love, presented by a repentant villain; and which also contained bills and notes to the high amount of ten thousand pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>And no name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>None; nor could I ever guess at the generous donor. I need not tell thee what my heart suffered when death deprived me of her. Thus circumstanced, this good man, Sir Abel Handy, proposed to unite our families by marriage; and in consideration of what he termed the honor of our alliance, agreed to pay off every incumbrance on my estates, and settle them as a portion on you and his son. Yet still another wonder remains.—When I arrive, I find no claim whatever has been made, either by Morrington or his agents. What am I to think? Can Morrington have perished, and with him his large claims to my property? Or, does he withhold the blow, to make it fall more heavily?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="52" facs="51"/>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>'Tis very strange! very mysterious! But my father has not told me what misfortune led him to leave his native country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip </speaker>
<stage>(greatly agitated).</stage>
<p>Ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>May I not know it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Oh! never, never, never!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>I will not ask it—Be composed—Let me wipe away those drops of anguish from your brow.—How cold your check is! My father, the evening damps will harm you—Come in—I will be all you wish—indeed I will.</p>

<p>Young man, you oppress me—forbear! I do not merit thanks—pay your gratitude where you are sure 'tis due—to Heaven.

<p>I <hi>your</hi> debtor!</p>

<sp>

<speaker>Sir Philip </speaker>
<stage>(impatiently)</stage>
<p>To the business that brought you hither.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Thus then—I believe this is your signature</p>
<stage>(producing a bond).</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Ah! <stage>(recovering himself)</stage> it is—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Affixed to a bond of £. 1000, which by assignment is mine. By virtue of this I discharge the debt of your worthy tenant Ashfield; who, it seems, was guilty of the crime of vindicating the injured and protecting the unfortunate. Now, Sir Philip, the retribution my hate demands is, that what remains of this obligation may not be now paid to me, but wait your entire convenience and leisure.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip</speaker>
<p>No; that must not be.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Did he speak of me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>He did—and of your daughter. "Conjure him," said he, "not to sacrifice the lovely Emma by a marriage her heart revolts at." Teil him the life and fortune of a parent are not his own. He holds them but in trust for his offspring.
<pb n="67" facs="66"/>Bid him reflect, that while his daughter merits the brightest rewards a father can bestow, she is by that father doomed to the harshest fate tyranny can inflict.</p>

<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Torture <stage>(with vehemence).</stage> Did he say who caused this sacrifice?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>He told me you had been duped of your fortune by sharpers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Aye. He knows that well. Young man, mark me—This Morrington, whose precepts wear the face of virtue, and whose practice seems benevolence, was the chief of the hellish banditti that ruined me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>That bond you hold in your hand was obtained by robbery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Confusion!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Not by the thief who, encountering you as a man, stakes life against life, but by that most cowardly villain, who, in the moment when reason sleeps and passion is roused, draws his snares around you, and hugs you to your ruin; then fattening on the spoil, insults the victim he has made.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>On your soul is Morrington that man?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>On my soul he is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Thus, then, I annihilate the detested act—and thus I tread upon a villain's friendship</p>
<stage>(tearing the bond).</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Rash boy! What have you done?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>An act of justice to Sir Philip Blandford.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>For which you claim my thanks?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I am thanked already—here <stage>(pointing to his heart).</stage> Curse on such wealth; compared with its possession, poverty is splendour. Fear not for me—I shall not feel the piercing cold; for in that man whose heart beats warmly for his fellow
<pb n="68" facs="67"/>low creatures, the blood circulates with freedom— My food shall be what few of the pampered sons of greatness can boast of, the luscious bread of independence; and the opiate that brings me sleep, will be the recollection of the day passed in innocence.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Noble boy! Oh! Blandford!</p>

<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Ah!</p>

<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>What have I faid?</p>

<p>You called me Blandford.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>'T was error—'T was madness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Blandford! a thousand hopes and fears rush on my heart. Disclose to me my birth—be it what it may, I am your slave for ever. Refuse me, you create a foe, firm and implacable as—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Ah! am I threatened? Do not extinguish the spark of pity my breast is warmed with.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>I will not. Oh, forgive me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Yes, on one condition—leave me: Ah! some one approaches. Begone, I insist—I entreat.</p>

<p>No, Sir, rather indisposed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Upon my soul, I am devilish glad to find you. Compared with this Castle, the Cretan labyrinth was intelligible; and unless some kind Ariadne gives me a clue, I shant have the pleasure of seeing you above once a week.</p>

<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>I beg your pardon, I have been an inattentive host.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Oh, no; but when a house is so devilish large, and the party so very small, they ought to keep together; for to say the truth, tho' no one on earth feels a warmer regard for Robert Handy than I do—I soon get heartily sick of his company—whatever he may be to others, he's a cursed bore to me.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Where is your worthy father?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>As usual, full of contrivances that are impracticable, and improvements that are retrograde; forming, altogether, a whimsical instance of the confusion of arrangement, the delay of expedition, the incommodiousness of accommodation, and the infernal trouble of endeavouring to save it —he has now a score or two of workmen about him, and intends pulling down some apartments in the east wing of the Castle.</p>

<p>Oh! forbear! forbear!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Excuse me, Sir,—an alliance, it seems, is intended between our families, founded on ambition and interest. I wish it, Sir, to be formed on a nobler basis, ingenuous friendship and mutual confidence. That confidence being withheld, I must here pause, for I should hesitate in calling that man father, who refuses me the name of friend.</p>

<p>Strictly just—But, oh!—you know not what you ask—Do you not pity me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Most true.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>I am not impelled by curiosity to ask your friendship. I scorn so mean a motive. Believe me, Sir, the folly and levity of my character proceed merely from the effervescence of my heart —you will find its substance, warm, steady, and sincere.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>I believe it from my soul.—Allow me a moment's thought.— <stage>(Aside)</stage>—Suspicion is awakened, does not prudence as well as justice prompt me to confide in him. Does not my poverty command me. Perhaps, I may find a sympathizing friend—the task is dreadful—but it must be so—perhaps, he will perform the awful task of visiting the chamber, and removing every vestige of guilt. <stage>(To him)</stage> Yes, you shall hear my story, I will lay before your view the agony with which this wretched bosom is loaded.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>I am proud of your confidence, and am prepared to receive it.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Not here—let me lead you to the eastern part of the Castle, my young friend—mark me: This is no common trust I repose in you; for I place my life in your hands.</p>

<p>You rivet my attention.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>While we were boys, my father died intestate, So I, as elder born, became the sole possessor of his fortune; but the moment the law gave me power, I divided, in equal portions, his large possessions, one of which I with joy presented to my brother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>It was noble.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>At least it was just—we lived together, Sir, as one man; as my life I loved him, and selt no joys but what he shared—Sorrow I knew not.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Such love demanded a life of gratitude.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip</speaker>
<stage>(with suppressed agony).</stage>
<p>You shall now hear, Sir, how I was rewarded. Chance placed in my view a young woman of superior personal charms; my heart was captivated—Fortune she possessed not—but mine was ample. She blessed me by consenting to our union, and my brother approved my choice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>How enviable your situation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Oh! <stage>(sighing deeply)</stage> On the evening previous to my intended marriage, with a mind serene as the departing sun, whose morning beam was to light me to happiness, I sauntered to a favourite tree, where, lover like, I had marked the name of my destined bride, and with every nerve braced to the tone of ecstacy, I was wounding the
<pb n="73" facs="72"/>bark with a deeper impression of the name—when, oh, God!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Pray proceed!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>When the loved offspring of my mother, and the woman my soul adored—the only two beings on earth who had wound themselves round my heart, by every tie dear to the soul of man, placed themselves before me; I heard him— even now the sound is in my ears, and drives me to madness—I heard him breathe vows of love, which she answered with burning kisses—He pitied his poor brother, and told her he had prepared a vessel to bear her for ever from me.—They were about to depart, when the burning fever in my heart rushed upon my brain—Picture the young tiger, when first his savage nature rouses him to vengeance—the knife was in my gripe—I sprung upon them—with one hand I tore the faithless woman from his damned embrace, and with the other—stabbed my brother to the heart.</p>

<head>SCENE I.—<stage><hi>A wooded view of the country.</hi></stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SUSAN ASHFIELD, <hi>who looks about with anxiety, and then comes forward.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SUSAN.</speaker>
<p>I FEAR my conduct is very imprudent.—Has not Mr. Handy told me he is engaged to another? But 'tis hard for the heart to forego, without one struggle, its only hope of happiness; and conscious of my own honor, what have I to fear? Perhaps he may repent his unkindness to me—at least I'll put his passion to the proof; if he be worthy of my love, happiness is for ever mine; if not, I'll tear him from my breast, tho' from the wound my life's blood should follow. Ah, he comes—I feel I am a coward, and my poor alarmed heart trembles at its approaching trial—pardon me, female delicacy, if for a moment, I seem to pass thy sacred limits.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>By Heavens, the misfortunes of Sir Philip Blandford weigh so heavily on my spirits, that —but confusion to melancholy! I am come here to meet an angel, who will, in a moment, drive away the blue devils like mist before the sun. Let me again read the dear words; <stage>(reading a letter)</stage>I confess I love you still,<stage>(kisses the letter)</stage> but I dare not believe their truth till her sweet lips confirm it. Ah, she's there—Susan, my angel! a thousand thanks. A life of love can alone repay the joy your letter gave me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p>Do you not despise me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>No; love you more than ever.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Robert, this is the very crisis of my fate.—From this moment we meet with honor, or we meet no more. If we must part, perhaps when you lead your happy bribe to church, you may stumble over your Susan's grave. Well, be it so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Away with such sombre thoughts!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p>Tell me my doom—yet hold—you are wild, impetuous—you do not give your heart fair play—therefore promise me (perhaps 'tis the last favor I shall ask), that before you determine whether our love shall die or live with honour, you will remain here alone a few moments, and that you will give those moments to reflection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>I do—I will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p>With a throbbing heart I will wait at a little distance. May virtuous love and sacred honour direct his thoughts!</p>
<stage>(aside.)</stage>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I will reflect—that I am the most fortunate fellow in England. She loves me still—
<pb n="77" facs="76"/>what is the consequence? that love will triumph—that she will be mine—mine without the degradation of marriage—love, pride, all gratified—how I shall be envied, when I triumphantly pass the circles of sashion! one will cry, Who is that angel? another, "Happy fellow!" then Susan will smile around—will she smile? oh yes—she will be all gaiety—mingle with the votaries of pleasure, and—what! Susan Ashfield, the companion of licentious women! Damnation! no; I wrong her —she would not—she would rather shun society— she would be melancholy—melancholy, <stage>(sighs and looks at his watch)</stage> would the time were over. Pshaw! I think of it too seriously—'tis false—I do not—should her virtue yield to love, would not remorse affect her health? should I not behold that lovely form sicken and decay—perhaps die—die! then what am I? a villain—loaded with her parent's curses and my own. Let me fly from the dreadful thought—But how fly from it— <stage>(calmly)</stage> by placing before my imagination a picture of more honourable lineaments—I make her my wife. Ah! then she would smile on me—there's rapture in the thought —instead of vice producing decay, I behold virtue emblazening beauty—instead of Susan on the bed of death, I behold her giving to my hopes a dear pledge of our mutual love. She places it in my arms—down her father's honest face runs &amp; tear, but 'tis the tear of joy. Oh, this will be luxury— paradise!—Come, Susan—come, my love, my soul, my <hi>wife!</hi></p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="78" facs="77"/><hi>Enter</hi> SUSAN—<hi>she at first hesitates—on hearing the word</hi> wife, <hi>she springs into his arms.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Yes; those charms have conquered.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p>Oh! no; do not so disgrace the victory you have gained—'tis your own virtue that has triumphed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>My Susan! how true it is, that fools alone are vicious. But let us fly to my father, and obtain his consent. On recollection, that may not be quite so easy. His arrangements with Sir Philip Blandford are—are—not mine, so there's an end of that. And Sir Philip, by missortune, knows how to appreciate happiness. Then poor Miss Blandford —upon my soul, I feel for her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Susan </speaker>
<stage>(ironically).</stage>
<p>Come—don't make yourself miserable. If my suspicions be true, she'll not break her heart for your loss.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ash.</speaker>
<p>What, axed three times?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and from this moment I'll maintain that the real Temple of love is a parish church —cupid is a chubby curate, his torch is the sexton's lantern, and the according paean of the spheres is the profound nasal thorough bass of the clerk's Amen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ash.</speaker>
<p>Huzza! only to think now—my blessing go with you, my children!</p>
</sp>

<p>And Heaven's blessing too. Ecod, I believe now, as thy feyther zays, thee canst do every thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>No; for there is one think I cannot do—injure the innocence of woman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ash.</speaker>
<p>Drabbit it, I shall walk in the road all day to zee Sue ride by in her own coach.</p>

<p>I do hope thee will not be asham'd of thy feyther in laa, woolye?</p>

<p>Nay, Sir, by your own confession I <hi>am</hi> where I ought to be.</p>

<p>No; you ought to be at the Castle— Sir Philip is there, and Miss Blandford is there, and Lady Handy is there—and therefore—</p>

<p>Old man, do not cling to me thus— 'Sdeath! men will encounter peril to ruin a woman, and shall I hesitate when it is to save one?</p>

<p>Aye—now to unfold the mystery —The avenue to the eastern wing is still passable —the chamber not yet in flames—the present moment lost, and all is closed for ever. I will be satisfied, or perish.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>

<p>Yes, only blessing of my life! In future thy wishes shall be mine—thy happiness my joy.</p>

<p>My dear friend safe! and the lovely Emma in his arms! Then let the bonfire blaze.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>My young friend, do you mark? the flames will save the trial I imposed on you. Behold —they already burst from the eastern turret! Ere this they must have reached the chamber— that consumed, the secret is with us secure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss B.</speaker>
<p>Oh, father, this unkind man has refused me, and given his hand to that sweet girl.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Handy, jun.</speaker>
<p>I confess 'tis true—Your eyes can only fail to conquer those who are before subdued.</p>

<p>But, Emma, where is your Henry? I wish to be just to him—I wish to thank him.</p>

<p>He has withdrawn to avoid our gratitude.—</p>

<p>Ah! <stage>(shrieks.)</stage> Thank heaven he's safe. What urged you, Henry, again to venture in the Castle?</p>

<p>Fate! the desperate attempt of a desperate man!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Ah!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Yes; the mystery is developed. In vain the massy bars, cemented with their cankerous rust, opposed my entrance—in vain the heated suffocating damps enveloped me—in vain the hungry flames flashed their vengeance round me! What could oppose a man struggling to know his fate? I sorced the doors, a firebrand was my guide, and among many evidences of blood and guilt, I found —these!</p>
<stage>(produces a knife and bloody cloth.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip</speaker>
<stage>(starts with horror, then with solemnity).</stage>
<p>It is accomplished! Just heaven, I bend to thy decree!—Blood must be paid by blood! Henry, that knife, aimed by this fatal hand, murdered thy father!</p>

<p>Ah!</p>

<p>Henry! <stage>(he drops his hand.)</stage> Oh, believe him not! 'Twas madness! I've heard him talk thus wildly in his dreams! We are all friends! None will repeat his words—I am sure none will! My heart will break!—Oh, Henry! will you destroy <hi>my</hi> father?</p>

<p>My brother, Morrington!</p>

<p>Turn not away—in mercy hear me!</p>

<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Speak!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>After the dreadful hour that parted us, agonized with remorse, I was about to punish home what your arm had left unaccomplished; when some angel whispered— Punishment is life, not death—Live and atone!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>On! go on!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>I flew to you—I found you surrounded by sharpers—What was to be done? I became Morrington! littered with villains! practised the arts of devils! braved the assassin's steel! possessed myself of your large estates—lived hateful to myself, detested by mankind—to do what? to save an injured brother from destruction, and lay his fortunes at his feet!</p>
<stage>(<hi>places parchments before</hi> Sir PHILIP.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
<p>Ah! is it possible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<p>Oh, is that atonement? No—By me you first beheld her mother! 'Twas I that gave her fortune! Is that atonement? No—But my Henry has saved that angel's life—Kneel with me, my boy— lift up thy innocent hands with those of thy guilty father, and beg for mercy from that injured raint.</p>
<stage>(HENRY <hi>kneels with him).</hi></stage>

<head>EPILOGUE,</head>
<byline><hi>Written by</hi> MILES PETIT ANDREWS, Esq SPOKEN BY MR. FAWGETT.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>So here I am—once more to bear a bob,</l>
<l>And for our Author do a friendly job;</l>
<l>Perhaps you don't know how to clap a Play;</l>
<l>Mind me—hand rattle hand—thus <stage>(claps his hands)</stage>—that's the way!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>No doubt you think, though second sure to none,</l>
<l>I'm rather sanguine about number <hi>One;</hi></l>
<l>Ask all the world, who everything would try,</l>
<l>And all the world will answer, I! I! I!</l>
<l>Your sprightly Damsels seeking active fame,</l>
<l>Will rival schoolboys in each schoolboy game;</l>
<l>Give 'em but rope enough, they'll shine in skipping!</l>
<l>While many a lucky rogue may catch them tripping:</l>
<l>Others, with beauteous arm and lovely shoulder,</l>
<l>Conspicuous to each accurate beholder,</l>
<l>Vaulting on toe, with tamborine and bells,</l>
<l>Surpass the heroines of—Sadler's Wells!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Nor less our Beaux excite our admiration;</l>
<l>Their shoulders too are worthy observation;</l>
<l>Not bare indeed, but cas'd in tenfold stuffing—</l>
<l>They need not, if they like not, feel a cuffing;</l>
<l>Nay what's more frequent, and preserves as much,</l>
<l>They save the pressure of a Bailiff's touch.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Stuffing's a charm attracts us every minute;</l>
<l>E'en female bosoms find protection in it;</l>
<l>Expos'd to open charms and powerful flattery,</l>
<l>Why not gain conquests by a well-mask'd battery?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But truce to satire—Folly's lost in doubt,</l>
<l>And this age enters e'er that age goes out:</l>
<l><pb n="94" facs="93"/>
None know, so none to blame can find pretext,</l>
<l>Whether we sin last century or the next.</l>
<l>"You're a base man!" cries wealthy Madam Dump,</l>
<l>To her fond spouse who took her by the lump,</l>
<l>"To hide a wench last week behind the screen!"</l>
<l>"Last week, my love!—last <hi>Century</hi> you mean."</l>
<l>"Sure! says Miss Lydia Lank, an ancient maid,</l>
<l>"You will not countenance that painted jade:</l>
<l>"I hate to name the odious word <hi>miscarried;</hi></l>
<l>"And yet the wanton minx was never married!"</l>
<l>"That's an old story!"—"Old! two months or so."</l>
<l>"Two months! you dream! a <hi>Century</hi> ago!"</l>
<l>"Dam'me!" cries Dash, "each age has its beginning!"</l>
<l>His chin quite buried in five rounds of linen;</l>
<l>"Think you we drive through life with too much haste?</l>
<l>"'Tis neck or nothing with us lads of taste!"</l>
<l>"Your taste!" cries Dad; "I fear your credit shocks,</l>
<l>"The rise of <hi>Cravats</hi> proves the fall of <hi>Stocks:</hi></l>
<l>"Save then to-day, to-morrow we'll want some."</l>
<l>"To-morrow, Squaretoes! That's an <hi>Age</hi> to come!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Since then from changeful Time's uncertain state,</l>
<l>Our very foibles now are out of date;</l>
<l>Let the Bard's faults find shelter on the Stage,</l>
<l>And let his labours live at least an age.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Chear with your smiles the Poet's growing joy—</l>
<l>A scanty harvest must his hopes destroy;</l>
<l>To brighten future prospects, all should now,</l>
<l>With heart and hand unite to—Speed the Plough!</l>
