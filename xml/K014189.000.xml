<speaker>TOBY.</speaker>
<p>WELL,—of all the cross-grain'd old Fellows breathing, my Master's Mistresses Father is one of the most hard to be dealt withal; and therefore 'tis for a Man of my Parts to succeed in an Assair that has baffled the Wit
<pb n="2" facs="4"/>
of all my Fellow-Servants. I perswaded him, before he try'd his own Skill, to make proof of mine, and I'll warrant I'll get the Letter to the Lady's Hands, if once I come near enough to touch 'em. I have a strange Inclination to Woman-Hunting ever since I clamber'd over the House-top, and got to Bed to <hi>Moll</hi> at the next Door, through the Garret-Window. Stay, this is the House; let me see, I think I am Woman enough in the lower Parts, and I am sure my upper won't fail me. I have Brass enough in my Face, and Depth enough in my Conscience to be really what I look to be—an <hi>Exchange</hi> Girl, Ifakins, I'll knock, come on't what will; I am sure I am safe enough in this Dress, for tho' 'tis no new thing to find a Knave in Petticoats, 'tis an immodest and an unlawful thing to look for him there.</p>
<stage>He knocks, and Sir <hi>Timothy</hi> looks out at the Window.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tim.</speaker>
<p>Who's at the Door?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>'Tis I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tim.</speaker>
<p>'Tis I, who's I? What's your Business?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>I would speak with Madam <hi>Leonora,</hi> Sir <hi>Timothy Tough</hi>'s Daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tim.</speaker>
<p>In what Language would you speak with her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>In what Language? Why in good old <hi>English.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Sir Tim.</speaker>
<p>Good old <hi>Engllsh!</hi> I'd have you to know you must speak good plain <hi>English,</hi> if you talk with my Daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>Is your Worship Sir <hi>Timothy Tough</hi> his own self then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tim.</speaker>
<p>I am the Man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>I beg your Worship's pardon, I come from Mrs. <hi>Stitch</hi> in the <hi>New-Exchange,</hi> so please you, Sir, and have brought home a new Head for the young Lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tim.</speaker>
<p>Wait, Maiden, you shall have Admittance.</p>
<stage>He goes from the Window.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>Rare Fortune, I faith! Well, I must needs say in my own Commendation, 'tis not every Body's Talent to manage a thing discreetly. What will this Master of mine owe me for so great a Service as I shall certainly do him? When a Man has good luck among Women, they say he was born under <hi>Caper-corn,</hi> I think they call it; and I shall go near to prove that <hi>Caper-corn</hi> my Master's best Planet. Adsme, I hear 'em opening the Door, now for it.</p>
<stage>The Door opens, and enter <hi>Sir Timothy</hi> with a great Blunderbuss, and two Servants with Guns and Buff Belts.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>Bless my Heart, what Figures are here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tim.</speaker>
<p>Houswife! I suspect you for a wicked Hypocritical designing Person, that has a felonious intention to corrupt the Obedience of my Daughter, and, lest
<pb n="4" facs="6"/>
you should have more Rogues in Ambush, I issue arm'd, to defend the Honour of my Family. What are you? I say what are you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>Oh, dear Sir! what do you mean? I never did you any harm in my Life, Sir—Oh! oh! loving Sir, have Mercy upon me dear Sir, for the sake of my spotless Virginity.</p>
<stage>Runs behind Sir <hi>Timothy,</hi> who present his Blunderbuss against one of his own Servants.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tim.</speaker>
<p>What are you? Speak or you die.</p>

<p>Slife Sir, don't shoot me, I'm <hi>Robin.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tim.</speaker>
<p>Adso, a bad mistake! I am dimsighted truly; but where is the Whore, the Bawd? I know what sort of a Shop she keeps, by hanging out the Sign of a Band-box. What do you do behind, Housewife? your Business is with the Foreparts. <hi>Harry, Robin,</hi> present with me thus, and when I speak the Word, give Fire.</p>
<stage>They all present their Pieces at <hi>Toby.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear Gentlemen, spare me, spare me, good Gentlemen, don't shoot me, and I'll tell you all.</p>
<stage>He kneels.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Tim.</speaker>
<p>In the first place, as you hope to preserve that abominable Life of yours, answer me the Truth, and nothing but the Truth, whence come you?</p>

<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>From the <hi>Exchange,</hi> an't please you.</p>

<p>What are you the <hi>New-Exchange?</hi> 'Slife, speak sense or you die, I don't think the Tone of your Voice treble enough for a Whore, and therefore you must be a Rogue, Sirrah.</p>

<stage>Aside.</stage>
<stage>Sir<hi>Tim.</hi> opens the Band-box, and finds a Letter.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Tim.</hi></speaker>
<p>Let's see, what's here, a Letter? Oh, Rogue! here, <hi>Harry, Robin,</hi> rifle the Ribons, and see if there's never another Snake in the Fools Grass. What's here, <stage>Puts on a pair of Spectacles.</stage> To the lovely Hands of the engaging <hi>Leonora—</hi>Fool, Ass, adzooks this Fellow makes love like an <hi>Oxford</hi> Scholar. I'll open the Seal.</p>
<stage>He breaks open the Letter, and while the two Fellows are fumbling in the Band-box,<hi>Toby</hi> steals back.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>Toby.</speaker>

<p>An't please your Worship, I believe he got off while we were rummaging the band-box.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Tim.</hi></speaker>
<p>I'll rummage you, you careless Rascals; I'll teach you to plunder before you have secur'd the Enemy, you Dogs you.</p>
<stage>He beats 'em with the Blunderbuss off the stage.</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Faith, <hi>Toby,</hi> I pitty thee with all my Heart; but thou may'st make a moral use of this unlucky Accident, and learn to believe thy self no wiser than other People. Go, lay aside the Woman, and and take up the Statue; all things are now ready for the last Trial, and it shall be put in Execution this very Evening.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby,</speaker>
<p>Truly, Sir, if your Worship pleases, I had rather be the Carver's Man, than the Statue; for if the old Knight shou'd find out a Trick, my Disguise wou'd be so heavy that I cou'd not run away, and he might chance to shoot me thro' the Head with his Blunderbuss.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>Pish! Fool! you know he's so purblind he can scarce see.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but if he can't see, he can feel tho'; and, Sir, if he should happen to tickle my Sides, I shou'd burst out a laughing, and discover all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>It's impossible he shou'd suspect thee. I saw the Statue at the Stone-Cutter's, who told me, the old Gentleman expects it to be brought home every day, My painted Canvas is exactly copied from the Original, and the Pedestal 'tis to be plac'd on in the Hall is so high, that he won't be able to reach your Sides; or if he did, the Daub is so hard and so thick, 'twou'd deceive a nicer Touch than his I'll warrant thee. But are the Fellows at hand, who are to be concern'd in the management.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>They are all drinking at the next Ale-house, and the Gentleman who is to act the Statue instead of me, Sir, is a Man every Inch of him. He married a Woman who had beat six Husbands to death with the But-ends of their own Muskets, and in three Nights time made the wild Beast so very tame, Sir, that she fawns upon him like a Spaniel Bitch when she's afraid of a Kicking.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>Thou hast chose an odd sort of a Simile, <hi>Toby;</hi> but hark! some body knocks; Go, see who it is.</p>
<stage><hi>Toby</hi> goes out, and re-enters with <hi>Cuttum.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>An't please your Worship, this is the Gentleman we were discoursing about.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>May I know your Name, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cuttum.</speaker>
<p>I am vulgarly known by the Name of Corporal <hi>Cuttum;</hi> I have been a Soldier from my Cradle, and a Cuckold from my Marriage-Bed, Sir: I have run thro' all the Mazes of Fortune, but cou'd ne'r lay hold of the Gypsie: I believe I'm too <hi>honest</hi> to be <hi>prosperous</hi> in this Age! and if I live much longer, I shall be too old to be <hi>knavish.</hi> I wou'd gladly make some use of my time, Sir; for I have lately learn'd to remember, that I come of a Race so much the Reverse of my way of living hitherto, that egad—if I continue honest much longer, I shall be the only Fool of my Family!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Mr. <hi>Cuttum,</hi> what Country are you of?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cuttum.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, to tell you the plain Truth, there is no Country will own us, and we own no Country; we should be <hi>French</hi> by our Air, and <hi>Spaniards</hi> by our steps, Sir; but a parcel of scoundrel Rogues about Town will needs have the <hi>Cuttums</hi> to be an <hi>Irish</hi> Family, sor no other Reason egad, than the reach of their assurance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>Have you no Friends in Town to apply to?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cut.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, there's a Relation of mine generally known about Town; he's a kind of a Wit, and has writ Plays; but he has an odd Humour, that makes him incapable of serving a Kinsman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>What Humour is that, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cut.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, he has been so fond of fathering Strangers Children, that he scarce knows how to look upon the Son of a poor Relation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>Well, Mr. <hi>Cuttum,</hi> you are a merry Fellow; you know the task and the reward design'd you, I suppose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cut.</speaker>
<p>My worthy Friend, Mr. <hi>Toby</hi> here, has inform'd me at large; and I am ready to prove with how much Zeal I would undertake an action of greater difficulty upon a less temptation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>I assure you you have heard the utmost of your danger; come the worst to the worst 'tis but a beating, and that I presume you could bear with Resolution.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cut.</speaker>
<p>Am I a <hi>Cuttum,</hi> and do you ask that Question? 'slife, Sir! bear a beating?—Why, there's not a Branch of our Family, but has Patience enough that way sor an informing Constable, Bailiff's follower, Female Tatler, or Marshal of <hi>France,</hi> egad.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>That's well; I think all things are now in a readiness, we'll go in, and about it presently. But heark'e, <hi>Toby,</hi> is your disguise come home yet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>Four hours ago, Sir—But now you talk of a Disguise, am I to be a Jew, or a Gentile?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spright.</speaker>
<p>Oh! a Jew by all means. Come along Mr. Corporal; while you are getting
<pb n="10" facs="12"/>
ready I'll instruct you what to say to the Lady, for the ill Success of my last Letter forbids me all Thoughts of sending another.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Tim.</hi></speaker>
<p>'Sbud, don't tell me of my Promise; ask any Statesman in Christendom, if Promises are Chains on a wise Man's Will. 'Tis true, I told the young Fool <hi>Sprightly</hi> he should have you, but that was when no Body of a better Estate was of his Mind, Girl.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>The ties of Duty, Sir, first led me to encourage Mr. <hi>Sprightly</hi>'s Addresses, in obedience to your Commands; and now the ties of Honour forbid me to wrong a Man who so sincerely loves me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Tim.</hi></speaker>
<p>I gave him my word, that if he could outwit me, he should keep what he got, with my good Will, and a good Fortune; but alas, poor young Fool, his Birdlime is no better than Chaff, and an old Fowl is too wise to be taken by it. I have defeated five or six of his Projects already; and if he comes within the reach of my Blunderbuss, have at him, by Sir <hi>Jeremy.</hi></p>

<p>No, no, pray stay, Daughter; I'll warrant you, if <hi>Sprightly</hi> was coming instead of the Statue, you would not be in such haste to be gone; but you Women never care much for a Man of Marble</p>

<p>I beg your pardon heartily, if I have said any thing that offends you, Sir; but pray don't be in a Passion for nothing; is not the Work done as you expected it?</p>
<stage>All the while Sir <hi>Tim.</hi> is talking with <hi>Toby, Cuttum</hi> makes whimsical Motions from the Table to <hi>Leonora,</hi> who leans pensively, and don't observe him.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> Tim.</speaker>
<p>Expected it, Sirrah! I did not expect to have the Figure to be sent home by a Rogue of a Jew, Sirrah! Let me look all round the piece, egad, 'tis 10 to 1 but the superstitious Dog has circumcis'd my Statue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> Tim.</speaker>
<p>Villain, Rascal, what, am I to be laughed at to my Face?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, you must excuse me, Sir, ha, ha, ha, I vow you are the pleasant'st Gentleman of your age that ever I met with.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> Tim.</speaker>
<p>Again at my age, Sirrah; here, <hi>Robin, Jonathan,</hi> quickly, bring me my Blunderbuss. Sirrah, get out of my House, or I'll break off a Limb of the Statue, and knock out your Brains with it.</p>
<stage>He runs to pull off one of the Statue's Legs, and <hi>Cuttam</hi> kicks him down backward with the other.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>'Slife! all's out: I'll make off while I can.</p>
<stage>He runs out.</stage>

<p>Heav'ns, Sir! what's the Matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> Tim.</speaker>
<p>Matter! you Baggage? Don't you see what's the Matter? That long bearded Rogue of a Jew has affronted me to my Face, and beat out my Teeth behind my Back. Rogues! <hi>Robin, Harry, Jonathan,</hi> what, must I be murder'd, and no body come in to my assistance.</p>
<stage>He runs out calling the Servants.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cut.</speaker>
<p>I am glad he's gone, for my Heart ak'd plaguily when he came to pull my Leg off. 'Tis a lucky Mistake that he thinks <hi>Toby</hi> struck him; but I'll take this Opportunity to speak to the Lady. Madam—Madam—</p>
<stage>He leaps down, and stalks towards <hi>Leon.</hi> who turns, and shrieks at his approaching her.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Heav'ns, what's here! Ghosts! Spirits! Devils! ah! help! help! help!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cut.</speaker>
<p>Nay, now we are all undone, and egad! if you die a Maid, 'tis no more than you deserve for your damu'd unseasonable squeaking.</p>
<stage>He runs to the Table, and with much ado gets up, and stands in his old Posture; but for haste mistakes, and puts the wrong Leg forward.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Ah me! I see too late this is a Trick of <hi>Sprightly</hi>'s.</p>
<stage>Enter Sir <hi>Timothy,</hi> and his Servants.</stage>
<p>Oh! Sir! I was half frighted, but beg your
<pb n="15" facs="17"/>
pardon for alarming you; being in a melancholy Humour, I had forgot the Statue stood upon the Table, and looking that way on the sudden took it for a naked Man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> Tim.</speaker>
<p>Oh! did you so, good Daughter! I see very well what you would be at; this Excess of your Folly betrays the Lewdness of your Thoughts. Let's see, that Rascal Jew beat off my Spectacles—oh! here they lie—Well, I vow this is a very curious piece of Sculpture, no real Flesh and Blood could appear more lively. If that Knave <hi>Chissel</hi> had not sent it by a Jew, I could have been extreamly pleas'd with it. <stage>He views <hi>Cuttum</hi> all round, who expresses a great deal of Fear.</stage> But stay, I forgot to look whether I have not-hurt the Leg tho'—adso! what's here? I am sure this Limb does not stand as it did just now. Daughter, Daughter. <hi>Leon.</hi> Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> Tim.</speaker>
<p>Look here, is it the right Posture or no?</p>
<stage>While Sir <hi>Tim.</hi> turns to speak to his Daughter, <hi>Cut.</hi> puts his Leg as it was before.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>Right, Sir? Yes, pray what ails it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> Tim.</speaker>
<p>Ails it? 'Slife I am bewitch'd—I am sure the Devil's either in me, or my Spectacles; why 'twas but this moment the Leg stood here, and now—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cut.</speaker>
<p>Death, Sir, stand out of my way, or you're as dead as a door-nail. <stage>Aside.</stage> 'Slife, I'll be gone while I may; if I stay a quarter of an hour longer, I shall be pounded in a Mortar.</p>
<stage>He leaps down furiously and runs out.</stage>

<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> Tim.</speaker>
<p>Hey day! is my House become an enchanted Castle? What a plague, I shall be hooted at as I walk along the streets if this Jest passes on me. Here follow me, ye Rascals, I'll statue the Dog, I'll warrant him.</p>
<stage>He runs out with his Servants after <hi>Cuttum.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<p>What a wretched Condition has my Folly brought me to? if I slip this Opportunity of escaping while the House is in so great a Confusion, I shall be miserable for ever. I'll get out the back-way, and trust fortune for the Event of my Undertaking.</p>
<stage>She goes out.</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Toby.</speaker>
<p>Here have I crawl'd about this quarter of an hour, and can find no means to reach the Door, without being discover'd by some of the old Fellow's Maidenhead-watchers; and, if I stay here much longer, the danger will be equal. A Pox take Petticoats for <hi>Toby,</hi> if this be the Effect of following them. What shall I do?—let me think a little—adsbobs I have it, I have an old black Mask in my Pocket with Horns upon it, I'll tie it on, and creep down into yonder Well, it looks like a dry one; or if I am drown'd, 'tis a better Death than to be drubb'd to Destruction—I'll lie quietly all Night, and in the Morning bolt thro' the Door in my Vizor and black Wastcoat; it may so happen, that
<pb n="17" facs="19"/>
the Rogues will take me for the Devil that they say walks in this Neighbourhood, and give me free Passage—But first, down Cloak, that if the Well be deeper than ordinary, I may be sure to fall softly; I'll tie on the Mask when I'm safe at the bottom. So now for it, Neck or nothing, as the Proverb says.</p>
<stage>He throws down his Cloak, and gets into the Well.</stage>

<speaker><hi>Sir</hi> Tim.</speaker>
<p>Who would have thought that the four Rogues who brought in that Dog of a Statue, should have waited so cunningly to carry him off again upon occasion? Adzooks but we maul'd them in their Retreat. Go, ye Rogues, get ye into the Cellar, and drink your selves drunk, as a Reward for your Valour. <stage>The Servants go out bowing.</stage> Well, after all, this <hi>Sprightly</hi> is a brave bold Fellow, and deserves the Baggage heartily; for I never could imagine till now, that any Woman in the World was worth a Man's venturing a knock on the Pate for. My Daughter is afraid of a Reprof, and is crept silently into her Closet. I'll not disturb her till Morning, but go write an Account of this Nights Works to her good old Grandmother in the Country.</p>
