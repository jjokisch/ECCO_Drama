<head>To Mrs. JORDAN.</head>
<opener><salute>MADAM,</salute></opener>
<p>IN the Hours of Meditation, when the Mind was on its researches for a Patroness to the following Petit Drama, I was not long at a loss for One to whom I might with propriety pay my respects. The very conspicuous figure you have made upon the Stage, brought your Merits to my view, and from those I thought there could be no impropriety in my laying this Trifle at your feet. The tutelary Sisters, Melpomene and Thalia, who preside over all the Scenic Arts, have taken you by the hand and placed you on a pedestal so high, that Envy lowers her scowling front whene'er she casts her jaundiced Eye upon your exalted Station, for you justly assimulate the pathetic manners of the one, and fascinate with the
<pb facs="4"/>
bewitching archness of the other. This perhaps may look like flattery, but those who know me, know <hi>that flattery is a talent which I never yet possessed,</hi> and, for the want of which, perhaps I may have hatched some Snakes and Scorpions who have endeavoured to breathe their venom upon the blossoms of my reputation. In the present instance certain malevolant Competiters attempted to sting my rising hopes and disconcert the eminent and arduous exertions of the Performers, to whom I am so much indebted on this Piece's first assay;—yet I had the satisfaction to see it baffle all their Spleen, and now, Madam, I submit it to the APPROBATION of the PUBLIC, and hope it will receive your PROTECTION.</p>
<closer><signed>I have the Honor to Subscribe myself, MADAM, your most Humble and Obedient Servant, <hi>GEORGE SAVILLE CAREY.</hi></signed>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THE PRINTER begs leave to observe that the Reviewers of Theatricals in the MORNING HERALD and other respectable PRINTS, who saw the Representation as well as the Editors of the LONDON, EUROPEAN, NEW LADY'S, and other MAGAZINES, have spoken of this New Piece in very Respectful Terms. "That it is replete with wit, whim, and good humour, and exhibits a well timed satire on the bent of fanciful individuals, demonstrating that <hi>Every Man</hi> has his <hi>Hobby,</hi> and that all mankind, are, at some period of Life or other, the <hi>Dupes of Fancy.</hi> Upon the whole they pronounce this Farce to surpass mediocrity, and that its merits justly deserve that kind reception from the Public which it has experienced." The Author is well known to the world by his Lectures on Mimicry, Imitations, and other humourous writings;
<pb facs="6"/>
and all lovers of dramatic productions and the Public in general will be highly gratified by a sight and perusal of this Comic Piece.</p>
<p>On it's first appearance at the Hay Market, some objections were made to it's <hi>length,</hi> particularly in the Dinner Scene, but by the Author's Judicious curtailment for future Representation, every objection of this kind will be obviated. It is however printed as originally written, and such parts of it marked as were omitted in the representation. It is presumed it will be performed this Summer, at many of the Watering Places throughout the Kingdom, and that it will be brought forward with some amendment and alteration next Season at the King's Theatre.</p>

<stage>(THE ACTOR COMING ON THE STAGE AS IF IN ANGER
WITH THE PROMPTER.)</stage>
<l>I WISH your Prologues, all, were in the Sea,</l>
<l>You're sure to saddle ev'ry one on me.—</l>
<l>Each trembling Author, shews a frighten'd mind,</l>
<l>And cries to me—Pray will you be so kind</l>
<l>As say a word or two, to paliate</l>
<l>The apprehensions that around me wait.—</l>
<l>A pretty task!—and, nothing more, in brief,</l>
<l>Then feeling guilty, hollows out—"Stop Thief!"</l>
<l>Should the thing please—pray, what do I get by't?</l>
<l>I'll tell you what—I prologuise each night.—</l>
<l>Wit, like a Diamond, is bright and scarce,</l>
<l>Our Author's Wit (poor soul) is all <hi>a Farce</hi>;</l>
<l>You'll see it clearer ere the matter's ended,</l>
<l>But, saying little, is the soonest mended.—</l>
<l>I've got a part to play—'tis time to budge,</l>
<l>Hoping, that while you listen, you will judge</l>
<l>With Mercy—nor make absolute the <hi>Case,</hi></l>

<head>Scene I. <stage>The Kitchen.</stage></head>
<stage>GABY discovered tying on his neckcloth, and seemingly to be admiring himself in the Looking-glass, when DOLLY comes in and taps him on the shoulder.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>WHAT is that which you are taken with so much, Mr. Lazy-bones? why you have been looking at yourself this half-hour, and now you look as if you were frightened out of your wits!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Frighten'd!—frighten'd at what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>At yourself to be sure, and I do not wonder at it; why your head looks like a rumpled hen that has gone through a hedge backwards, and your face is as pale as a parsnip.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>You are making me out a strange creature forsooth, may'nt a body tie on one's neckcloth without being frightened out of one's wits at the looking-glass.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="10"/>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Tying on your neckcloth truly;—heavens what a sloven;—why you have not above half tied it;—I suppose you will be for making love to me with your collar open again.—You look in the face for all the world like the picture of the starved poet, in my master's dressing room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Faith and troth you are full of your skits, Mrs. Dolly; but for all that, I have heard people say, that to be careless is to be modish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Modish, modish, ha! ha! ha!—I never saw such a modish ninny as you before, it is enough to make one kill one's self with laughing, I am sure you shall never go into the parlour such a comical figure as that—only look at yourself again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Why, how would you have me look?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Like a man to be sure.—You that are drawn for the militia too—why you ought to look like a soldier!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>How in the name of patience am I to look like a soldier before I'm taught.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Let me put on your neckcloth, and I'll shew you how.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Ah, that you shall, and thank you too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Kneel down then, and you shall see what a comely figure I will make of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Kneel, aye, that I will and pray too, if you like it, my dear little chick-a-biddy.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(GABY kneels while DOLLY ties his neckcloth so tight, that it almost choaks him.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>There! there! there!—you seem now as if you had a little blood in your face, you look like a soldier now with a witness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p><stage>(Struggling)</stage> Murder! murder! murder!—Oh, pray!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="11"/>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha!—Well, now since I have brought you to your prayers I am satisfied, and you shall be releas'd—but it is a pity you had not been choak'd, you look'd so pretty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>And should you have lik'd to have seen me choak'd Dolly?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Choak me if I should not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Why Dolly, now that's so cruel of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Why?—because you're such a lazy, lubberly, slovenly creature.—Don't you know that this is Saturday, that Alderman Grub is coming to visit Master, and you've got nothing ready.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Lord help you, be'ant I always ready, what would the woman have me do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>What?—why there are all the knives to clean; my Master's new wig to comb out; the tobacco pipes to wax at the ends; and the sanddishes to be got in readiness—you know that they smoke like a couple of Turks!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Lord bless me I had forgot all that to be sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>I knew you had, you've a precious memory, but my Master would not be apt to forget you I fancy, if you had not got them all prepared in time;—you know he is never so happy as when surrounded with smoke.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Nor I neither, Dolly—Lord, it is my heart's delight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>I'm glad to hear that, for it convinces me that you will make a better soldier.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>What are they so fond of smoke then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Every good soldier is fond of the smoke of gunpowder to be sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I never lik'd that ever since I had like to have been blown up with it the last fifth of November; I'll tell you all about it;—you must
<pb n="12" facs="12"/>
know that I had got a whole pound of powder, and was making of squibs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Making of squibs was you, and so, I suppose, you went off in a cracker?</p>
<stage>[Bell rings.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Odds-bobbs! Master's bell rings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Aye, and if he catches you here with your gunpowder stories, he will be for blowing us both up.</p>

<head>SCENE II.</head>
<stage>(Mr. TINTEM is discovered in his morning gown and velvet cap, surrounded with garden pots, flower-sticks, and a pen stuck in his cap, with which he marks some of the labels.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>They say that every man has his hobby horse, and without one has something in pursuit, life is as insipid as tripe, without mustard or vinegar.—My hobby-horse is my flower-garden, and I can ride that with safety, for I shall never be afraid of that kicking me in the stomach, or breaking my neck with stumbling.—I expect my friend Grub here by and by, and think that I shall amaze him with the variety of colours, which I shall present to him in my amphitheatre.—Mr. Grub has his hobby-horse too, but his horse is a butter-fly;—I often tell him, that he is as fond of pursuing a fly, as a fish or a swallow.—But I must make haste, he will be here soon, and if we should not happen to have the dinner on table exactly at <hi>one,</hi> he will be for stinging me with reproaches, and buzzing in my ears like a gnat.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="13" facs="13"/>Enter GABY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Did you ring, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Yes, to be sure—yet one would have thought that you had forgot it, by your being so long in coming—What was you about?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Nothing, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>I suppose so—I should have been angry with you had you not told me the truth, for that is one of the hardest things in the world to get at.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, I always tell the truth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>You are mistaken, I am afraid, and have marr'd all; you only told me truth by way of accident, because you was too dull of invention, and had not time to tell me a falshood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>I never tell a falshood, Sir, but when I cannot help it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Well,—I hope Dolly told you that Alderman Grub was coming to dine with me to day?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>And are all things in readiness?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Yes—Sir;—No—Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir; no, Sir!—there seems to be a lie, and a true saying, both in a breath, which of them am I to believe?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Which you please, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>I suppose so—therefore I am inclin'd to believe that you have got nothing ready.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>'Faith, Sir, you have hit it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Hit it, have I?—Why you audacious Scoundrel, I have a good mind to hit you; I'll knock you down, you blockhead—Where is my Wig?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Upon the block, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="14"/>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>I wonder that <hi>you</hi> have it not <hi>on</hi> then; is it dress'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, not quite dress'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>I declare I have a good mind to give you a good dressing—go to your brother block and finish it immediately; it is insufferable to have two blockheads in the house at once. But first take this, and bid the gard'ner to place it in the Amphitheatre; the third row; between that of Arrogance and Indifference; being a modist flower, its blushes will be the more distinctly seen.</p>

<p> "What a strange thing is fear, it sits as Lord Chief Justice of our Conscience, and often extorts a falshood, or makes us tell the truth, by being over-aw'd from Apprehension of Conviction—This fellow of mine, take him in common, as a servant, is not a bad one;—he has always an inclination to tell the truth, yet his heart is never couragious enough to prevent his give way to a falshood.—But how goes time— <stage>(pulls out his watch)</stage> odds so, it is almost twelve o'clock, we shall have Master Grub here by <hi>one.</hi>"</p>

<p>Aye, how goes on the Dinner?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLY.</speaker>
<p>As fast as the Jack and Fire can make it, Sir;—Cook, Sir, is broiling away like a post-horse in the Dog-days.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>And if she should happen to be a minute too late, my friend Grub would have no more mercy upon her, than the hasty rider upon his jaded steed.</p>

<p>Cook, you know, Sir, is a little rough in her paces, if he were to fall foul of her, he might stand a chance to be flung, and get his bastings.</p>

<p>In her dressing room, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Tell her it is Twelve o'Clock—Mr. Grub will be here presently; bid her get ready to receive him, and not be behind hand as she generally is upon these occasions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Oh, never fear her, Sir; she may be ready to receive him in order to please you, but she will be the more glad to get rid of him to please herself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean by that you impudent baggage,—hey?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>I can hardly tell what I mean, myself, Sir;—but there is a certain old gentleman that will acquaint you soon enough I warrant you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>An old Gentleman!—What old Gentleman, Huzzy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>Why Sir, the old gentleman that goes see-saw, see-saw in the face of our clock, who has got only one lock of hair on his forehead, and a scythe in his hand;—old Master Time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Was there ever such insolence.—Away with you then, and don't stay loosing <hi>your</hi> time here, but mind your business, and take care that every thing be properly placed.</p>

<sp>
<p>Here is the place, and this the Temple wherein resides the Goddess of my affections:—while I like a poor and devoted Pilgrim have wander'd hither thus disguis'd, to render up my offerings, and soothe those pangs of love which rankle in my breast—I have taken this disguise, lest I should be discover'd by the imperious and avaricious eye of one that is fix'd by fate as a guard to check the inclinations of her lenient bosom.—Therefore will put my little stratagem into execution, by singing an old English Ballad, and see if I cannot attract the notice of some of the Domestics; to whom, I may communicate my purpose, and thro' whom I may perhaps have an opportunity of seeing the beloved object of my heart.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Charming! you are a dear good creature and I love you for it.—But what is to be done; I know not what to do, or what to say—I am all confusion; I that should at this moment be nothing but contrivance and manoeuvre, am, by the present unaccountable flurry on my spirits, rendered incapable of every thing, that might be the means of my future happiness.</p>

<p>Don't make yourself uneasy, Miss, I was neither so foolish or so brutish, but I had thought enough about me to take proper care of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>In what respect?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>In respect to his dinner—for I have sent him up a cold <hi>Collection</hi> as they call it, and provided him with some veal and ham; the cold giblet pye, some cold pudding, by way of settling his love, and a bottle of wine to wash it down whenever he pleases.</p>
</sp>

<p>Excellent!—you delight me.— <stage>(Bell rings.)</stage> that is my uncle's bell.—Go, and ask what he wants, and let me know immediately.</p>
<stage>[Exit DOLLY.</stage>
<p>I am delighted with the frankness and attachment of this good natured girl, but extreamly aggitated at the state of poor Mr. Willingford; sure it is the most provoking and tantalizing situation in the world.—The man I love, and whom I have not seen this month, to have him under the very roof with me, and even there depriv'd the sight of him, when instead of receiving him as I ought, to have him lock'd up in a state of apprehension and fear, is hard indeed!</p>

<p>No, indeed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>No not I—Besides they are such a set of imposing Rascals, that they would often charge me Six-pence for a half-penny's worth of Small beer, and you know one can get a quart of good sound porter in London for three-pence half-penny.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>

<p>I beg pardon, Master Grub, but you can't help being entertaining.</p>

<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart, and I dare say my little intended will not refuse to join me.—I'll give you a toast, if I can remember one—odds-bobbs I have it—I'll give you, "Love without Interest."</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Nay, don't be cruel to her, don't banish her this time; her laughing was perhaps only an innocent frolick—a liberty, you know, that lovers will take with one another, now and then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>"Sir, she must not be indulged in this way—but console herself alone, 'till she can behave better."</p>

<p>"Ah, Master Tintem, you are a wag—you seem to know how to manage the Ladies to a nicety—perhaps it may be all for the best.—My dear little intended don't you mourn—don't you get piping now by yourself—a little absence, they say, is sometimes a great <hi>sedement</hi> to love—is it not deary?"</p>

<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>A fine chearful afternoon I protest!</p>
</sp>

<p>The weather is chearful enough it is true, but as to myself, I am melancholy enough.</p>

<p>I am sorry for that—why should you be melancholy—what's the matter?</p>

<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>No!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>No—there is very litttle affection, I am afraid, about that tittering heart of her's—I doubt she does not love me truly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM</speaker>
<p>Not love you?—never trouble yourself about that—I'll make her love you.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>She is in my power at present, and <hi>shall</hi> marry you whether she will or not, and when she is yours, you know what you have to do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>What is that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Why you have nothing to do then but to keep her under your thumb.</p>

<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>Under his thumb! and if he does, I wish she may not slip through his fingers. <stage>(aside)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB</speaker>
<p>I am told there is a Mr. Willingford, a young spark, to whom she turns a willing ear, if so, it will be a difficult matter to wean her of him.</p>

<p>You are right enough there old Gentleman. <stage>(aside)</stage></p>

<p>Oh, never let that give you any concern; he is nothing but a Boy, and a Beggar.</p>

<p>As to his being a Beggar, that will be no impediment, especially if he has been ingenious enough to coax her Heart from her.</p>

<p>Confound your capering apprehensions I say—Why, you talk like a Simpleton—what can you be afraid of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>There was a confounded Stag's head, and an aukward pair of horns in your hall, which look'd butt in my face as I entered your house to day, and I cannot help thinking them <hi>omnious.</hi></p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>No, no—I don't say that either, your Niece is young and beautiful, a little sweet creature any body might be fond of, and I will do her the justice to say that I think she would like any young fellow better than me.</p>

<p>I think so too, and therefore let us go and amuse ourselves with a sight of your Hobby-horse, as you call it.</p>

<p>I do not doubt but you will be polite enough to resolve me then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. WILLINGFORD.</speaker>
<p>Most certainly, and that from my heart—ah, me! I wish that you were mine, but that you know already, and your asking me to tell you now, seems as if you doubted me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>I do not doubt; but, when I consider the present state of things, I am rather surprised that you should persevere in running after me, especially when I shall tell you what a formidable rival you have to encounter.</p>

<p>A rival? is it possible!</p>

<p>I dare say they will quarrel, I am sure it would be the highest entertainment to you both, were you to go and listen to their comical conversation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>M. WIL.</speaker>
<p>Is this Mr. Grub, as you call him, the gentleman you signified to be my rival?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>The same; I promised that you should see him; therefore we can go and stand with safety and unseen behind the old yew hedge near the amphitheatre, where you may at once behold his delicious person, and hear his bewitching conversation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. WIL.</speaker>
<p>Agreed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>"Dolly, you must be sure to take care, should we be put to flight, to find a ready shelter again for Mr. Willingford."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>
<p>"Put to flight!—I know of no shelter in such a case, that would be so convenient as a tight post chaise and four good horses, to hurry you both out of harms way in an instant."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. WIL.</speaker>
<p>"An excellent thought."</p>

<sp>
<speaker>MISS TINTEM.</speaker>

<speaker>DOLLY.</speaker>

<head>SCENE III.</head>
<stage>(The Garden, with a view of the Amphitheatre)</stage>
<stage>Enter MR. TINTEM and GRUB.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Here they are Mr. Grub—here are my beauties—there's a display for you—there's an arrangement, all the colours of the rainbow; the eye is ravished with beholding, and the nose with smelling.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>This is truly a fine sight, Master Tintem.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Fine indeed! though I say it, Mr. Grub;—this is nature in her holiday-cloaths; you say you are fond of flowers Mr. Grub.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>So fond of them, that I always buy a halfpenny nosegay when I can, and stick it in my bosom whenever I go to church on a sunday.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha!—a halfpenny nosegay Mr. Grub?—I beg your pardon, but you make me laugh—a halfpenny nosegay truly—they must have been weeds my good friend;—weeds—what sort of flowers could they have been?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Sometimes a bunch of primroses, or the lillies of the valley; at other times I have treated myself with a few pale snow-drops, or yellow crocuses; which in my opinion, are the first of flowers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>The first of flowers—ha! ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>You must acknowledge that they are generally the first in the season.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="41" facs="41"/>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>I will acknowledge that they are the first colour'd weeds which the spring throws up; but we do not place them under the denomination of Flowers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>No!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>No—you talk of putting a whole bunch of Flowers in your bosom for a halfpenny; when many a single root of some of the Flowers now before you, have cost me, ten, twenty, nay thirty pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Mercy on me;—why you make me tremble at the very Idea.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Why should you tremble about it, when I have told you it is my Hobby-horse; and there are many of your high-flying dashers of the Turf, will give you a thousand or fifteen hundred guineas for a Hobby-horse, that shall crack a hole in the Fortune, or break the neck of his Rider, before he has had him a Week.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Mercy on us;—when I think on the follies and extravagancies of the age, I bless my stars, that I happen'd to be born with so much prudence about me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, Mr. Prudence, do not arrogate so much to your own merit;—you have got your Hobby-horse too;—I am told that you had the liberality, when you was at Mr. Lottum's Auction the other day, to give twenty guineas for a frame of dead Butterflies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Why that is <hi>neither here or there,</hi> as the saying is—We will not talk of <hi>them there</hi> things just now, but <hi>as to the matter of that,</hi> I don't know why I should not have my Hobby-horse, as you call it, as well as any body else.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="42" facs="42"/>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>To be sure—to be sure;—yours you know is a fly, and mine is a flower, that is the difference—so we will drop the present parley, and look before us.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter MR. WILLINGFORD, MISS TINTEM, DOLLY and GABY, behind the Yew Hedge.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>There they are, hard at it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MISS TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Hold your impertinence, Mr, Simpleton, if we should be discovered, it will mar all. <stage>(aside)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Here Mr, Grub, here's a flower for you, what do you think I call this.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I can't tell.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Did you never see a sign which bore a resemblance to this.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>A sign?—I have seen the sign of the <hi>Flower-de-Lucey</hi>; the Rose and Crown, and the Scotch Thistle, which I suppose is one of the Flowers of <hi>Edinborough.</hi></p>
<stage>[an inward laugh from behind.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Aye, but that is not the Idea—did you never see the sign of a General like this flower?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>A General!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Aye, a General?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>No truly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Why then, I'll tell you—That is the Duke of Cumberland.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>The Duke of Cumberland!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Aye, the Great Duke of Cumberland;—that flower made its first appearance in the Botanical world, in the Rebellion, Forty-five;—was nam'd in honor of the British hero of that day, and such a flower as this is enough to immortalize the memory of any General in the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="43" facs="43"/>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>What, is it an <hi>Evergreen,</hi> then?</p>
<stage>[a tittering from behind.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>An Evergreen?—Bless the man—Why, you seem to have no Idea of vegetation at all;—no more taste for a flower, than I have for a dead butterfly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I have generally got a good taste for them, when they produce a good smell to me, <stage>(smelling)</stage> but this flower seems to have no smell at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Psha;—what the Duce has smell to do with the beauty of a Flower;—it is the Colour we look at—the colour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Odds so,—I suppose so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GABY.</speaker>
<p>What a couple of comical creatures, ha, ha, ha. <stage>(from behind)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Wist, Wist!—I heard a strange kind of noise just now—you hav'nt any <hi>Varment</hi> about the Garden, have you—no Pole-cats or Weasels—I am strangely fearful of those kind of gentry;—and as to a Rat!—the very sight of a Rat would turn my whole <hi>mast</hi> of blood into a posset. <stage>(shews great apprehensions, which causes a laugh from behind)</stage> There again! I am sure there are <hi>Varment</hi> about us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Vermin—the Devil!—'Tis only some of those cursed Magpies who pestre the garden every day for the sake of the cherries.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Magpies! I hate your Magpies, they are the most hateful <hi>omnious</hi> bird that flies.—I was at Cuckold's point the other day, when I happened to be cross'd by one of those infernal Chatter-boxes, and in a minute or two after, I had the misfortune to break both my shins over a Hog-trough at my Cousin Crumplet's the Baker's door, which laid me up for a week.</p>
<stage>[a laugh again.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="44" facs="44"/>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>There again—there are certainly <hi>Varment.</hi><stage>(shews much fear.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>The Magpies, I tell you, the Magpies,—Look you here my friend Grub; since you are fond of a flower that has got a smell—Here is one I fancy that will tickle your taste, and your smell at the same time <stage>(Grub takes up the flower pot)</stage> Aye, that's right—take it up and smell to it—Put on your Spectacles, and look at it—there is a Turban, there is your Furr, there is the very Sash and Sabre of the Emperor himself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Emperor!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Aye, Emperor;—that is the Emperor of Morocco!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>The Emperor of Morocco; why you deal in nothing but grand names—This flower, I perceive has got a charming smell, this is something like a Flower; the Emperor of Morocco;—grand, very grand,—a fine sounding name, I protest. <stage>(Grub turns up his eyes with a kind of rapsodical ardour, and by accident discovers a fine butterfly, lets drop the flower pot, and tumbles over it, then gets up in a hurry with his hat in his hand, pursuing the butterfly, and crying out)</stage> Damme there goes the King of Bohemia!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p><stage>(In a great rage, runs and picks up the broken pot and the flower, crying)</stage> Damn your King of Bohemia.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
<p>Damn your Emperor of Morocco! I would not have lost my king of Bohemia, for all the Emperors in the world—no, not the Emperor of the Moon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>You wretch, you Nonentity, you thing without an Idea!</p>

<p>You fool, you Frantic, you Dasey-hunter, you stem of a Dog-rose, you bud of a Crocus,

you stinking root of a Daffy down-dilly; I would not have lost my King of Bohemia for all the nonsensical flowers in your garden.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MR. TINTEM.</speaker>
<p>Why, you Catterpiller, you Bug, you Beetle, you Gnat, you Grub—I would not have had my Emperor destroy'd for all the contemptible collection of Insects which you have been scraping together these thirty years;—and give me leave to tell you, Sir, that you behave like a dirty fellow.</p>
