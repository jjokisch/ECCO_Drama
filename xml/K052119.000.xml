<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Delamour <hi>and</hi> Thady <hi>in travelling dresses, meeting Young</hi> Woodville.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Young <hi>Woodville.</hi></speaker>
<p>HA! <hi>Delamour!</hi> welcome from <hi>Paris,</hi> my dear friend <stage>(embrace;)</stage> and honest <hi>Thady,</hi> how dost do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tha.</speaker>
<p>Je vous remercies; I am bravely, sir, thank your axing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Del.</speaker>
<p>The sight of my dear <hi>Woodville,</hi> in good health, gives me infinite pleasure. I am well,
<pb n="2" facs="4"/>
you see; but my heart, ah, <hi>Woodville,</hi> not all the sparkling beauties of the <hi>Louvre</hi> have had power to efface my charming <hi>Emily's</hi> dear, dear idea. But how does the lovely girl?—say, is she in town, that I may fly—ha! what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. <hi>Wood.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am extremely sorry that I am oblig'd, like your evil genius, to meet you with ill news on your arrival; but all the consolation I can afford my dear friend, is an assurance of my sister's constancy—To keep you no longer in suspense—my father has promis'd her hand to Sir <hi>Geofry Ginkle</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Del.</speaker>
<p>Cursed, infernal avarice! What motive else could have induced, the hitherto kindest parent, to make a sacrifice of his darling, his blooming <hi>Emily,</hi> to such an old—By Heaven I'll go this instant, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tha.</speaker>
<p>Arrah sir, sir, your putting yourself into passions, and flurries, is mighty silly—might silly; upon my soul—Couggar—I'll be bound to put you in a way, that you may have your own game with him. I'll tell you, d'ye see, I'll watch this Mr. <hi>Gingle,</hi> if it's <hi>Gingle</hi> you call him, and Manumshandoul, if I don't put the speak out of him,—and then, when the old divil is quiet in his grave, you may cuckold him as fast as you please. Eh, sir, <stage><hi>(turning to</hi> Woodville,)</stage> wou'dn't there be some fun in that? <stage><hi>(All this while</hi> Delamour <hi>walks about in great disorder.)</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Y. <hi>Wood.</hi></speaker>
<p>What, <hi>Thady,</hi> sure you would not commit murder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tha.</speaker>
<p>Murther, arrah fat, murther, an ould son of a whore that has one leg already in the grave, and if I trip the other after it, is that murther? Oh the devil a murther in that, sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. <hi>Wood.</hi></speaker>
<p>Come, come, <hi>Delamour,</hi> don't be so uneasy, your case is not desperate, the indissoluble knot is yet to be tied.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Del.</speaker>
<p>Happy <hi>Woodville,</hi> happy in being conscious you possess my sister's heart unrivall'd, free from the harsh injunctions of an obdurate parent to thwart your loves—but I—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. <hi>Wood.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ah, <hi>Delamour,</hi> I am no object to be envied, and far from having an assurance of <hi>Florimel's</hi> affections; happy, then, indeed should I be; but she is still the same gay, unthinking, lovely, witty rogue; if in the most unfeign'd rapture I breathe my love, the return is a loud laugh, an opera tune, or a ridiculous simile, which, faith, sometimes makes me look very silly; indeed, in her more serious moments, which are but few, she, perhaps, gives me an hearing, when all at once a crowd of gayer thoughts rush on, and kill at once the hopes wherewith I was elated a few minutes before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Del.</speaker>
<p>You shall find me a powerful advocate in your cause, but excuse me for deviating from the maxims of our modern professors of the law; my proceedings in your favour, will not be
<pb n="4" facs="6"/>
wholly disinterested; you must give me all the assistance in your power, to break the measures of your father and Sir <hi>Geofry;</hi> but how such a notion enter'd into his doating brain, is to me amazing. I've often heard him express the utmost abhorrence to matrimony; but then, when I reflect upon my <hi>Emily</hi>'s beauty, I can't wonder at his being caught; old goat—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. <hi>Wood.</hi></speaker>
<p>Love is far from being the sole motive of Sir <hi>Geofry</hi>'s addresses to <hi>Emily;</hi> the vain hopes of having an heir of his own begetting, to inherit his estate, (which, you know, is considerable,) and to mortify his nephew; these are the spurs which prick him on, in the road which has hitherto appear'd so dreadful to him. I dare say, you know this nephew; as Sir <hi>Geofry</hi> had no children of his own, and intended never to marry, he bred him up under his own care, placed his chief felicity in having him receive those accomplishments, proper for a person, who (as he was to inherit Sir <hi>Geofry</hi>'s estate after his decease) probably might make a figure in the great world; these accomplishments, join'd to a natural fine genius, a graceful person, and a beneficent courteous disposition, gain'd him the esteem of all who knew him—He was the darling of his uncle. But in this happy state, he, following the dictates of love before those of his interest, unknown to his uncle, espous'd a young lady whose only want was a fortune sufficient to render
<pb n="5" facs="7"/>
her a match suitable for the heir of Sir <hi>Geofry.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tha.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word I commend his notion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. <hi>Wood.</hi></speaker>
<p>This imprudence of the young gentleman so exasperated the old knight, that, when he heard of it, he swore he should never be a shilling the better for him; refus'd to see him; and now this unfortunate couple are oblig'd to subsist upon a small patrimony, left him by his father, in a remote part of <hi>Cornwall.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Del.</speaker>
<p>By your account, I really pity them, and wish with my soul, for their sake as well as my own, the current of his affections cou'd be turn'd to its former channel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. <hi>Wood.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh 'tis the most inflexible, positive Curmudgeon; you might as soon persuade a <hi>Jewish Rabbi</hi> to turn <hi>Jesuit.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tha.</speaker>
<p>A Rabbit turn Jeshit—upon my soul a comical change. Howsomever, they've very pretty boroughs; where we were they call 'em Colleges.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. <hi>Wood.</hi></speaker>
<p>He's so fix'd on the completion of this marriage, that, to make sure of my father's consent, he has offer'd to take <hi>Emily</hi> without a portion; there he touch'd the vein; my father, at first, shock'd at such an odd proposition, gave his old friend very little encouragement; but the mention of no fortune, together with Sir <hi>Geofry</hi>'s great estate, stifled all parental tenderness, and he now exerts all his authority, to
<pb n="6" facs="8"/>
oblige poor <hi>Emily</hi> to name the day, and, till then, to look upon Sir <hi>Geofry</hi> as a gentleman, whom his prudence has destin'd her for a husband. You may judge the distress these commands gave her, and the conflict she suffers, between her aversion to Sir <hi>Geofry,</hi> and the consequence of her acquiescence to her father's will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Del.</speaker>
<p>Poor dear girl! But cou'd I not get a sight of her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Oh, by no means, if my father knew of your arrival, 'twould bar all access to your future happiness, as he'd oblige her to marry Sir <hi>Geofry</hi> immediately; as yet, I'll not inform <hi>Emily</hi> you're in town; I'll meet you this evening at <hi>Fynmore</hi>'s in <hi>Pall-mall,</hi> where, I hope, we'll think of some expedients, for our mutual advantages; adieu, dear <hi>Delamour.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Del.</speaker>
<p>Farewel, you'll not fail. Come <hi>Thady:</hi></p>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Delamour.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tha.</speaker>
<p>Sir, Sir—Sir, I've one favor to beg of your Honor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wood.</speaker>
<p>Well, <hi>Thady</hi> let me hear; if it's in my power to do you one, you may command me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tha.</speaker>
<p>I want to know, sir—you'll, pardon my boldness—But—Sir, are you sure she is not—</p>

<p>Am I sure she is not; who is not—what, or who do you mean?</p>

<p>Oh—<hi>Thady,</hi> I understand you; why <hi>Thady</hi> you're very far gone in love; and is little <hi>Betty</hi> so happy as to be the object of your flame?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tha.</speaker>
<p>Burn me, sur, but I'm in a flame, sure enough; but, sur, may be some ould crab-jaw'd fellow or other, with a long purse, has laid a claw over her, as well as her mistress—Ogn, I am very fond of <hi>Betty.</hi></p>
</sp>

<p>Well, <hi>Thady,</hi> to comfort you, I believe Mrs. <hi>Betty</hi> has kept both heart and hand for you.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Tha.</speaker>
<p>Oh, upon my word, she loves me well enough; oh, that the poor devil does.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. <hi>Wood.</hi></speaker>
<p>Farewel, honest <hi>Thady</hi>—But you must not think of seeing your little <hi>Betty,</hi> as 'twould be contrary to your master's interest, for any of our family to know he's in town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tha.</speaker>
<p>Oh, never fear, sur; I'll be bound she shan't know I'm in <hi>London;</hi> no, no; but, sur, if you'd give your kind love, and surreverance to her for me, I'd—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. <hi>Wood.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, why <hi>Thady,</hi> that wou'd be letting her know I had seen you.</p>

<head>SCENE II.</head>
<stage>A Chamber in Sir <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, House, <hi>Emily</hi> is discovered sitting melancholy.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Emily.</speaker>
<p>How cruel is it for fathers to assume so unjust a prerogative, as to oblige children to marry who they please.—Because they are the means of bringing us into the world, they think to be ever after the sole disposers, and masters of our inclinations, and will make us happy, or miserable, according to their capricious tempers. Ah, unkind <hi>Delamour!</hi> after repeated vows of inviolable constancy, to leave me to the perils I now suffer—on the eve of being torn from you for ever.—But here comes my father and my wrinkled Strephon—Heigh ho—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Old</hi> Woodville <hi>and Sir</hi> Geofry Ginkle.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Ant.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why, how now child,—<hi>Milly,</hi>—what, still melancholy. <hi>Milly</hi>—what the plague, you'll make me angry at last.—Come, receive Sir <hi>Geofry</hi> as you ought.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>But, dear sir, consider.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Ant.</hi></speaker>
<p>I tell you I'll consider nothing, only—Sir <hi>Geofry,</hi> I beg your pardon; I was talking with my daughter, about some affairs relative to the marriage.—I must step to the <hi>Bedford</hi> Coffee-house for half an hour, or so—to meet a gentleman—Sir <hi>Geofry,</hi> as you'll eat a bit of
<pb n="9" facs="11"/>
dinner with us; I hope to find you here when I come back; bye, bye, <hi>Milly</hi>—Servant, Sir <hi>Geofry.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Geo.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, Sir <hi>Anthony;</hi> here, in the sun of my <hi>Emilia</hi>'s presence, will I bask till thy return.</p>

<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emil.</speaker>
<p>I wou'd, sir, that sun had sufficient power to melt you into pity. (I must summon all my little rhetoric, to turn this persecution from me, <stage>aside.</stage>) Think, sir, the violence you are doing me, in separating me for ever from the man I love; affinity in years, sentiment, circumstances, with him, all, all conspire to render me unhappy, in marrying you; if so, you shall have my hand alone; as my heart is the property of another, you can't expect it.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Geo.</hi></speaker>
<p>Zounds! at that rate she'd think nothing of giving the possession of her whole body to him that has her heart, if she'd a good opportunity; one comfort, he's in <hi>Paris;</hi> wou'd to heaven some testy Monsieur wou'd run him through the body.</p>
<stage>Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emil.</speaker>
<p>What, sir, am I not worthy of an answer?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Geo.</hi></speaker>
<p>Madam, I hope you'll pardon me. But I was considering, whether I should be married in a suit of brocade, (which, I assure you, is a very elegant suit,) or a suit of white
<pb n="10" facs="12"/>
and silver: Oh! the white and silver is very pretty, very pretty, indeed! Now, Madam, I'd consult your taste, which I know is exquisite; which do you think most proper?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p><stage>Aside.</stage> The monster mocks me; well, I'll serve him in his turn.—Oh, sir, white and silver, by all means, (I'll pluck up my spirit;) how unfortunate am I, to be prepossiess'd in favour of another; numbers of ladies of beauty and rank would be rejoiced, and with extasy accept of the honor of being lady <hi>Ginkle;</hi> setting your fine person, your graceful figure, your polite address, your—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Geo.</hi></speaker>
<p>Dear madam, where are you going? (Ay, the girl's in love with me, that's poz, tho' she won't own it, or how could she find out my perfections? She's a fine girl!)</p>
<stage>He struts about with an air.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>I say, sir, setting aside these irresistible perfections, your vast estate might captivate some gambling Dowager of threescore. Ha, ha, ha! since I can't bring him to reason, I'll give him a furfeit of my company; I wish <hi>Florimel</hi> were here to help me out. <stage>(Florimel <hi>sings without</hi>)</stage>.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Geo.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ah, zounds! I wish I was out of the house; now will they cut me up; they'll have no more mercy upon me, than an alderman would have upon a Turtle, at a city feast.</p>

<p>Oh, bless me—<hi>Emily</hi>—where got you this figure? Oh, at the sale at Spring-gardens, I suppose; 'tis very pretty, quite antique, moves admirably; by clockwork, to be sure; the nose, for all the world, like a bunch of Grapes.—</p>

<p>As I live and breathe, Sir <hi>Geofry Ginkle;</hi> my dear knight, pardon me; I heard that <hi>Williams,</hi> the Chinaman, had imported some new figures as large as life, and as I knew <hi>Emily</hi> was, there yesterday, I protest, I took your worship for a purchase she had made; your head went admirably <stage>(mimicks)</stage> better than any Mandarin, tho' you look more like an odious, old fashioned British Druid; no, no, you do not neither, for sweet simplicity sits on each contracted feature of that reverend visage; I'll tell you; stand you two together, as I live, you put me in mind of <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s Tale of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>May.</hi></p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>Oh, my dear, mad girl, let me hear what project has enter'd into that fertile brain of thine, to serve me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Project! I have, indeed, a project; but before you know it, I must have your promise of compliance to my directions—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>Oh, with pleasure, for I'm sure, it must be for my good; let me hear, my dear Sibyl—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Not so fast; act as I instruct you, and I'll lay my life sir <hi>Geofry</hi> shall be as eager for breaking off the match, as ever he was to forward it—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, I'm all attention—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Well, then, how wou'd you like a gallant? Wou'd you take that gallant to your arms, to your bed—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>Fye, fye, <hi>Florimel,</hi> insult not the afflictions of your friend?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Remember your promise; a gallant
<pb n="14" facs="16"/>
you must have; but I'll turn traitor to you, and bring your father and sir <hi>Geofry;</hi> to a thorough conviction of the freedoms between this spark and you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>Sure, my dear <hi>Florimel</hi>'s not in earnest—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I see, madam, you've no occasion for my advice, or assistance; I wish your ladyship a good morning—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I'll submit to whatever you propose for my freedom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! I see, <hi>Emily,</hi> you have not such an aversion to a youthful sprightly gallant; but faith you'll be deceiv'd, for, behold that gay young fellow before you; what, my dear, wou'd you be afraid to venture between a pair of sheets with me; you'll find me as harmless a bedfellow as Sir <hi>Geofry</hi> himself—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>Dear romantic girl, but what can all this tend to?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Can you trust your maid <hi>Betty?</hi> if so, she'll be necessary—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>With my life—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Well, then, you had better call her, to receive her instructions—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>Who's there? <stage>[<hi>Enter</hi> Footman]</stage> Send <hi>Betty</hi> here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Now, pray don't interrupt me. Sir. <hi>Geofry,</hi> notwithstanding his devoirs to you, has an aversion to the sex, which, by the flattering hopes of an ample revenge upon his nephew,
<pb n="15" facs="17"/>
and your beauty, <stage>(curtsies,)</stage> has been greatly abated: Now, I think our only way is, to revive that aversion, by some very flagrant proofs of your levity. <stage><hi>(Enter</hi> Betty.)</stage> How d'ye do, Mrs. <hi>Betty?</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bet.</speaker>
<p>At your ladyship's service, me'm—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Now, if our petticoat triumvirate does not counterplot, and defeat, the prudent schemes of our brace of wise grey beards, may my doom be to die an old maid; but to business.—I'll immediately write an anonymous letter to Sir <hi>Geofry,</hi> as it were from an unknown friend—I'll let him know, that the person he designs for his wife, is unworthy of that honor, by having, criminal connection with a certain gentleman;—To corroborate this, I'll appoint a time, when he may have ocular demonstration of her dishonour; he'll immediately fall into his old opinions, and, receiving this as orthodox, fly to the place of appointment. Now I've two or three suits of <hi>Delamour</hi>'s cloaths—one suit remarkably rich—these will I put on, and at the time appointed, which may be some very unseasonable hour, will come, and be let in by <hi>Betty</hi>—Then you shall see me, <hi>en cavalier;</hi> and you must own a figure less agreeable wou'd create a jealousy, in one more proof against deception, than your old lover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>Oh, my dear <hi>Florimel,</hi> the first thing he'll do, is certainly to tell my father, and I
<pb n="16" facs="18"/>
dread the effects of his rage.—In his first transports of fury, he'll turn me out of doors, then my imaginary shame will be publick. No, I could not bear to be esteemed what I most abhor.—Ah, <hi>Florimel,</hi> you have my sincere thanks, but I must not, cannot think of putting your scheme into execution.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, I must use you as a kind nurse would a froward child, force you to what's for your good.—You must, can, and shall carry this inimitable scheme into execution.—Faith, like a poor poet, I must praise the productions of my own brain, since I can get no other to do it.—Eh, Mrs. <hi>Betty</hi> what do you think?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bet.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, ma'am, I think your scheme is <hi>unlimitable,</hi> as your ladyship says; and I thinks as how, if my lady knows what's what, she'd stop at nothing to give sir <hi>Geofry a gust</hi> to her—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>A disgust, you mean.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bet.</speaker>
<p>Yes, ma'am; and when the truth is afterwards known, it will resound to your ladysihp's credit, and won't hurt your character; no, not in the least.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Oh! <hi>Emily,</hi> 'twould be a precious husband, <stage><hi>(Coughs, and mimicks Sir</hi> Geofry,)</stage> with his flannel night cap and drawers—"Oh, this damn'd gout—I'm almost tipsy with all the Port I've drank—yet no ease.—<hi>Mily,</hi> come to bed, dear;" then, says you, "You know, sir, I'm engag'd to my lady <hi>Cheatwell</hi>'s rout."

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emi.</speaker>
<p>Well done, <hi>Florimel;</hi> you've frightened me so much, by your picture of the connubial state with Sir <hi>Geofry,</hi> that I'll submit to whatever you'll have me.</p>

<p>Sir <hi>Geofry,</hi> Sir <hi>Geofry,</hi> is this a time for your cool, and your proper reflections?—Very well, sir, very well.—Sir, sir, let me tell you, you've used me ill, in the tenderest point, sir, and don't think it shall pass with impunity—But, sir, I see, I see thro' the shallow gloss you've given it; I see your mean, fordid reason for recanting, your repentance of the offer you made me of taking my child without a portion; there, sir, is your reason. Fye! fye! fye!</p>

<speaker>Sir <hi>Geo.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ungenetous man! to put such an evil construction upon and concealing that, which you shall know to your confusion; since I've no other means of justification, know, sir, your daughter's a prostitute; now, sir; you know my reason, <hi>Delamour</hi>'s the man who has dishonoured her; I saw him let into this house at two o'clock this morning; there's the mandate he obey'd; there, sir, read that, perhaps you know your daughter's hand; <hi>Delamour</hi> accidentally dropt it out of his pocket, and I pick'd it up; besides, I heard it all from his servant.</p>

<p><stage>[Reads]</stage><hi>Come this night, exactly at two o'clock, and</hi> Betty <hi>will conduct you to the longing arms of</hi> Emily.—Oh, unhappy girl! wretched, wretched father!—My friend, forgive me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Geo.</hi></speaker>
<p>From my soul.—I knew the effect the knowledge of this unfortunate affair would have on you, therefore I intended you should never know a syllable of it from me.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Ant.</hi></speaker>
<p>Here, <stage>[Going to the wing,]</stage> here, who's there? I'll turn the ungracious wretch out of my doors this instant, to meet the infamy she deserves—what, to make my house a brothel—As for her seducer, I'll—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Geo.</hi></speaker>
<p>No, no, hear reason, get the better of your choler; your exposing her in that manner would be wrong, quite wrong. Give me leave to advise you—Keep the whole a secret,
<pb n="29" facs="31"/>
even from your servants; as for <hi>Betty,</hi> she has been her confidant; send immediately to <hi>Delamour,</hi> found him about a marriage with <hi>Emily</hi>—I know his circumstances perfectly, as some of his land borders upon mine. He has a very pretty estate, but a little encumbered, owing to some extravagancies incident to young men of his volatile disposition. The fortune which I refused with <hi>Emily,</hi> will help to clear his estate, and pay off his sister <hi>Florimel</hi>'s fortune; these considerations, joined to an innate principle of honour, which I never knew him deviate from till now, perhaps may influence him to accept of your offer; but don't you mention the least knowledge of their intercourse—What think ye?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Ant.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why, I don't know, my dear friend, you're too good, too good, indeed; and so should I be to follow your advice—But though she has gone astray, yet she is still my child.—Were I sure he'd cover her shame by marriage, with pleasure I'd double her portion—But 'tis most amazing—I did not think <hi>Delamour</hi> was return'd from <hi>France</hi>—Oh, sure, if I knew he was in the same kingdom, I should have taken better care of her; but, however, I'll send for him immediately—But 'tis to no purpose—a likely thing, a young fellow, like him, would tye himself for life to one he has gained upon such easy terms; and as for trusting to his honour, the young
<pb n="30" facs="32"/>
fellows of this age use the bare word as an instrument of deception on the weaker sex; the practice to them is a mere jest: Indeed her fortune, I don't know what that may do; I won't see her till I try my success with him, which is so much the better for her, for I don't think but I should dash her brains out, were I to see her. I'll instantly send to him.</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Geo.</hi></speaker>
<p>Do. Well, my friend Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> I can't say but you're rightly serv'd, for preferring the love of your pelf, to the future peace and happiness of your child. Zounds! what an old, blind fool I must be, to think of marrying a girl of eighteen, as if I did not know the sex perfectly—I, that am now—let me see, how old am I now?—eh—adod, I'm upwards of threescore; aye, I shall be sixty-two the eighteenth of next—aye, <hi>September</hi>—I'm greatly afraid that young dog <hi>Delamour</hi> will not marry the girl—I wish he wou'd—I pity her, from my soul—Well, well, I'll send to <hi>Cornwall</hi> for my poor nephew and my pretty niece, and reinstate him in my favour—Poor <hi>Ned</hi> was always a good lad, and how can I blame him for doing a thing I was upon the point of doing myself; more excusable in him, because of his youth—Farewel matrimony—Well, if ever I marry, may this foolish sconce of mine be adorn'd with a pair of horns, each as long as a barber's pole.</p>

<p>Mr. <hi>Delamour</hi> I am glad to see you—</p>

<p>I shou'd think myself extremely happy in the good wishes of friendship of Sir <hi>Anthony Woodville</hi>—But as things have happen'd, since my leaving <hi>England,</hi> I protest I can't account a reason for having the honour of seeing him by him own command—</p>

<p>Why, Mr. <hi>Delamour,</hi> to wave all superfluous ceremony, I've a proposal to make to you, which, as I'll make it entirely your interest to accept, you won't refuse.</p>

<p>Sir, I'm attention.</p>

<p>Well, then, Mr. <hi>Delamour,</hi> if none of the <hi>Parisian</hi> girls has your heart in keeping, what wou'd you think of a wife of your own country, a plain <hi>English</hi> girl, with a good fortune? I say, what think you of my <hi>Emily;</hi> you were once fond of her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Oh, heavens, sir, your <hi>Emily!</hi>—I have always, and do still think of her, as the supreme object at which all my hopes of future felicity are pointed—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Ant.</hi></speaker>
<p>Very well, sir; the fortune I intended to have given with <hi>Emily,</hi> if married with my consent, was six thousand pounds; now, sir, as I am conscious of your extraordinary merit, whereby I think you are not indifferent to her, if you love her well enough to marry her, I'll double that sum; what say you, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Del.</speaker>
<p>This happiness so unexpected—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Ant.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh, sir, then you won't—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Del.</speaker>
<p>With the most unfeign'd joy, with rapture, sir, I accept your offer, free from a lucrative view; and my future study shall be to convince you your goodness was not ill-plac'd—</p>

<speaker>Sir <hi>Ant.</hi></speaker>
<p>I take you at your word; and now, <hi>Delamour,</hi> as I see you're a man of honour, I forgive you what's past. Ah, <hi>Delamour!</hi> be kind to my poor child, use her well—Oh happy change!—Here, <hi>Betty,</hi> call your mistress—</p>

<speaker>Flor.</speaker>
<p>Then, sir, since your sagacity's not of a sufficient length to reach the bottom, I must give you a line to eke it out, and to right my innocent friend, who has suffered so much in your opinions. Now, Sir <hi>Geofry,</hi> and you, Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> look upon <hi>Emily</hi> in a different light than what you've lately done—She had a gallant, 'tis true, and here he stands, in the circumference of this simple petticoat, to hinder a preposterous match between Sir <hi>Geofry</hi> and my dear <hi>Emily,</hi> which would render her inevitably miserable. I wrote you, Sir <hi>Geofry,</hi> that anonymous letter, to which you gave so much credit; and in that suit of cloaths, which now my brother wears, I personated your imaginary rival, dropt the billet of assignation, which you found and shew'd Sir <hi>Anthony.</hi> These machinations of mine having had such happy effects, and as my real motive for deceiving you both, proceeded from my eagerness to serve my dear <hi>Emily,</hi>—I hope you'll both forgive me.</p>

<p>Ay, ay, you were a party concern'd: Well, I forgive you.</p>
