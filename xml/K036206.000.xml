<p>EUGENIA: A TRAGEDY. As it is ACTED at the THEATRE-ROYAL, IN <hi>DRURY-LANE.</hi> By His MAJESTY's Servants.</p>
<p><hi>LONDON:</hi> Printed for A. MILLAR, over-against <hi>Catharine-street,</hi> in the <hi>Strand.</hi> MDCCLII. (Price 1<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi>)</p>

<head>To the Right Honourable The COUNTESS of <hi>Lincoln.</hi></head>
<opener><salute>MADAM,</salute></opener>
<p>I Truly wish this Play were more worthy of your Ladyship's Name. Yet I do not presume to offer it to you for its poetical Merit. I dedicate to you, Madam, the Virtues of your Sex. Whatever seems to me most amiable and estimable in Woman, I have endeavoured to shew in the Characters of <hi>Eugenia</hi> and <hi>Orphisa.</hi> In <hi>Orphisa,</hi> that Fortitude of Spirit, that Dignity of Sentiments, that exalted Understanding, which, in my Ideas, form the Woman of Quality; and in <hi>Eugenia,</hi> that Purity of Heart, that Gentleness of Disposition, that filial Piety, which give to Youth its best, its truest Loveliness.</p>
<p><pb n="vi" facs="3"/>
Whether I have succeeded, your Ladyship, in your own Feelings and Experience, can best determine. If I have, let me be bold to expect your Patronage. It is for the Interest of that Virtue, which you love; for it is not sufficient, Madam, to practise her Precepts in your own private Life; you must come forth and do her Honour by a public Appearance in her Favour. In her Name, I expect your Protection; in her Name, let me dare to promise, my future Life, and its best Gratitude shall deserve it.—I am,</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written and spoken by Mr. <hi>GARRICK.</hi></byline>
<lg>
<l>TO damn, or not—that is the Question now,</l>
<l>Whether 'tis best to deck the Poet's Brow;</l>
<l>With Hands and Hearts unanimous befriend him,</l>
<l>Or take up Arms, and by opposing end him—?</l>
<l>But hold, before you give the fatal Word,</l>
<l>I beg that I, as Council may be heard,</l>
<l>And what few Council ever yet have done,</l>
<l>I'll take no Bribe, and yet plead <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con.</hi></l>
<l>First for the Town and Us—I see some Danger,</l>
<l>Should you too kindly treat this reverend Stranger;</l>
<l>If such good Folks, these Wits of graver Sort,</l>
<l>Should here usurp a Right to spoil your Sport;</l>
<l>And curb our Stage so wanton, bold and free!</l>
<l>To the strict Limits of their Purity;</l>
<l>Should dare in Theatres reform Abuses,</l>
<l>And turn our Actresses to pious Uses!</l>
<l>Farewell the joyous Spirit-stirring Scene!</l>
<l>Farewell the—the—you guess the Thing I mean!</l>
<l>If this wise Scheme, so sober and so new!</l>
<l>Should pass with us, would it go down with you?</l>
<l>Should we so often see your well-known Faces?</l>
<l>Or would the Ladies send so fast for Places?—</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now for the Author—His poetic Brat</l>
<l>Throughout the Town occasions various Chat;</l>
<l>What say the Snarlers?—'Tis a <hi>French</hi> Translation.</l>
<l>That we deny, but plead an Imitation,</l>
<l>Such as we hope will please a free-born Nation.</l>
<l>His Muse, tho' much too grave to dress or dance,</l>
<l>For some Materials took a Trip to <hi>France;</hi></l>
<l>She owns the Debt, nor thinks she shall appear,</l>
<l>Like our spruce Youths, the worse for going there:</l>
<l>Tho' she has dealt before in sportive Song,</l>
<l>This is her first Stage-Flight, and t'would be wrong,</l>
<l>Nay poaching too, to kill your Bards too young.</l>
<l>Poets, like Foxes, make best Sport, when old,</l>
<l>The Chase is good, when both are hard and bold;</l>
<l>Do you, like other Sportsmen then, take heed,</l>
<l>If you destroy the Whelps, you spoil the Breed;</l>
<l>Let him write on, acquire some little Fame,</l>
<l>Then hunt him, Critics, he'll be noble Game.</l>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>IT may not be improper to tell an <hi>English</hi> Reader some Circumstances of this Play. The Character of <hi>AEMILIA,</hi> consequently her Scenes with <hi>MERCOUR,</hi> is wholly new. The Fable, excepting some Alterations, which seemed necessary, with regard to the Difference of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Stage, is taken from a Comedy published last Year by Madame <hi>Grafigny.</hi></p>
<p>Let me be permitted to take this Opportunity of returning my best Thanks to the several Performers, for the Chearfulness, with which they went through the Fatigue of Rehearsing and Acting. The Public is the best Judge of their Merit, and its Favour the best Proof of it.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> is intitled to my sincerest Gratitude, for his Performance as an Actor, and for his Punctuality, as a Manager; but his Assistance in a thousand Alterations, his strong good Sense, with that Spirit of Theatrical Criticism, which is his peculiar natural Genius, give him a Right to a great Share of that Applause, with which this Play was received. The rest is Friendship and Esteem.</p>

<head>ACT I.</head>
<stage>MERCOUR crosses the Stage; sees AEMILIA; endeavours to avoid her. She looks at Him some Time; then speaks.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIA.</speaker>
<l>AH! what a Look was there! How his Eye started</l>
<l>As from a Thing of Horrour! I am lost;</l>
<l>Abandon'd to an unavailing Penitence,</l>
<l>To the Upbraidings of my own weak Heart,</l>
<stage>[Looking after him.</stage>
<l>To Virtue's keen Reproaches. MERCOUR, MERCOUR—</l>
<l>For all the promis'd Joys of Love and Constancy,</l>
<l>Oh! teach me not to feel what now I am,</l>
<l>Or to forget what late I was, how bless'd</l>
<l>With Innocence—Alas! now lost for ever.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="7"/>
<speaker>MERCOUR</speaker>
<stage>speaking as he exters.</stage>
<l>It was the Musick of AEMILIA's Voice,</l>
<l>Tho' much untun'd from its delightful Sounds</l>
<l>When harmonis'd by Love. Tell me, my Heart,</l>
<l>Why did AEMILIA call me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIA.</speaker>
<l>Did I call you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MERCOUR.</speaker>
<l>Repeatedly; with Accent most alarming.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIA.</speaker>
<l>It was the Voice of Sorrow and Despair,</l>
<l>Not mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MERCOUR.</speaker>
<l>Despair! But how can it approach you,</l>
<l>By Friendship guarded in the Arms of Love?</l>
<l>Yet whence those Startings of the Soul, that rend</l>
<l>The labouring Breast? Why melts your Eye upon me?</l>
<l>Whence is that Paleness on my Fair-one's Cheek,</l>
<l>Where rosy Love, with Pleasure's Blushes glowing,</l>
<l>Was wont to dwell, amidst the Smiles of Beauty?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIA.</speaker>
<l>And sure—forbid it Love—you're alter'd too.</l>
<l>Are you the same? as constant to our Friendship—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MERCOUR.</speaker>
<l>As you are beautiful. Why doubts AEMILIA</l>
<l>Her wondr'ous Power of charming?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIA</speaker>
<l>Yet even now</l>
<l>Your Eye meets mine with Pain. Some secret Purpose</l>
<l>Turns it aside, and that once dear Protesting,</l>
<l>(Which Love was wont to warm with his own Language,)</l>
<l>Falls feebly from your Tongue. Yet treat me nobly.</l>
<l>For such a Waste of Tenderness and Truth,</l>
<l>Is it too much—for all that I have suffer'd,</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="8"/>
For all I'm still to suffer—to expect</l>
<l>A little kind Sincerity?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MERCOUR.</speaker>
<l>AEMILIA!</l>
<l>Can she suspect the Heart, that she has form'd;</l>
<l>Where fits her Image, in the Power of Beauty,</l>
<l>To rule its Passions, and inspire its Wishes?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIA.</speaker>
<l>Tell me my Fate; nor fear, that I'll upbraid you.</l>
<l>Nor shall my Rage, nor shall my Tears upbraid you,</l>
<l>Nor even my Love. I'll find a thousand Reasons</l>
<l>To justify your Change. I'll tell my Heart,</l>
<l>'Midst its resenting Beatings, that your Passions</l>
<l>Are not your own; that Love's inconstant Pleasures</l>
<l>Are sacred to your lordly Sex; that Men,</l>
<l>However just to Honour with each other,</l>
<l>Should scorn their fond Engagements with a Woman.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MERCOUR.</speaker>
<l>I would be just to both. For some Days past,</l>
<l>I own my Thoughts have been perplex'd, confus'd;</l>
<l>A thousand varying Projects for your Happiness—</l>

<l>Oh! my Soul's highest Pride,</l>
<l>Does it become the Dignity of Love,</l>
<l>To steal into your Arms; to hide our Joys</l>
<l>In Darkness and Concealment? I'll no longer</l>
<l>Bear these uncertain, casual Hours of Bliss,</l>
<l>But let the World behold and envy me</l>
<l>The rich Possession of AEMILIA's Beauties—</l>
<l>I'll make you mine for ever.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIA.</speaker>
<l>Your's for ever!</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="9"/>
Oh! let my Heart pour forth its Joy in Thanks.</l>
<l>Forgive th' unkind Suspicions; the Reproaches—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MERCOUR.</speaker>
<l>They were Suspicions, that arose from Love.</l>
<l>But will you hear?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIA.</speaker>
<l>My Soul is listening to you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MERCOUR.</speaker>
<l>My Father, to support his Country's Honour,</l>
<l>And his own noble Birth, in foreign Embassies</l>
<l>Consum'd a fair Estate, and left his Sons,</l>
<l>(My Brother and myself) dependant vilely</l>
<l>Upon my Uncle's Bounty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIA.</speaker>
<l>Oh! how nobly</l>
<l>Has he discharg'd the sacred Trust of Friendship,</l>
<l>And Duty of a Parent!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MERCOUR.</speaker>
<l>True; his Duty;</l>
<l>Then how are we oblig'd? Curse on the Name</l>
<l>Of Obligation. How my Soul disdains</l>
<l>This Insolence of Goodness, that enslaves</l>
<l>The free-born Mind! Is not his every Act,</l>
<l>An Insult on our Wants? Has he not gain'd,</l>
<l>From our Distress, the Name he most delights in,</l>
<l>The Name of Good? Methinks a rich Return</l>
<l>For trivial Benefits, without the Slavery</l>
<l>Of endless Gratitude.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AEMILIA.</speaker>
<l>Surely you mean</l>
<l>T'insult my Understanding. As for me,</l>
<l>He took me in Distress of Infancy,</l>
<l>The Orphan of his Friend. With every Tenderness,</l>
<l>Even of a Parent's Care, he form'd my Youth,</l>
<l>Alas! in vain, to Sentiments of Virtue.</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="10"/>
Here were no Ties of Blood, no Sense of Duty;</l>
<l>'Twas innate Goodness, and my grateful Soul</l>
<l>Through all its Feelings thanks him. But forgive me;</l>

<l>I have no Time to waste in idle Arguments</l>
<l>On visionary Subjects. Let me rather,</l>
<l>Demand your Aid; th' Assistance of your Friendship</l>

<l>Most exquisitely just, this purpos'd Insult.</l>
<l>And mark it, ye unhappy Ones, like me,</l>
<l>Thus shall it ever prove, who first betrays,</l>
<l>Will first insult our Weakness. Hear me, Sir,</l>
<l>Fall'n as I am from Honour, lost to Fame,</l>

<l>Sir, you hold me honest,</l>
<l>Nor would I lose my own, my Self-Esteem,</l>
<l>Or bear the Woundings of a secret Baseness,</l>
<l>Even for EUGENIA's Beauties. Then imagine,</l>
<l>Whether I could presume, without your Leave,</l>
<l>To talk to her of Love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DORIMOND.</speaker>
<l>Still truly just.</l>
<l>I own, I meant to give her to your Brother.</l>
<l>His Gayety of Youth, I thought, might charm</l>
<l>The fancy of a Girl; but as ye both</l>
<l>Divide my Heart, and share my best Esteem,</l>
<l>It is to me indifferent, who gains her.</l>
<l>I will propose you to her, and shall plead</l>
<l>Your elder Claim of Birth-right, as of Love.</l>

<sp>

<l>May Love's own Eloquence inspire your Tongue.</l>
<l>Paint the pure Passion of my Love, refin'd</l>

<l>The Aids of Art to paint th' unconscious Passion?</l>

<l>MY Morning's Joy, may all its dearest Blessings,</l>
<l>As fall its Dews on Earth, descend upon you.</l>
<l>Sure my EUGENIA, rising with the Morn,</l>
<l>Steals her Complexion from her. Why those Blushes!</l>
<l>A Father's Praise is but th' Excess of Fondness,</l>
<l>The Over-flowing of a Heart, that loves you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIA.</speaker>
<l>And can I wish it more? This tender Proof,</l>
<l>That your EUGENIA's not displeasing to you,</l>
<l>Is far beyond all Praise.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DORIMOND.</speaker>
<l>My Life's first Blessing;</l>
<l>But yet its tender Care, and soft Anxiety—</l>
<l>For while my Heart, with pleasurable Fondness,</l>
<l>Pours its Affections o'er you, still it trembles</l>

<l>That dwell with wedded Love; where holy Friendship</l>
<l>Inspires the mutual Wish; where equal Interests</l>
<l>Produce an equal Bliss; where each is happy</l>
<l>In th' other's Happiness?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIA.</speaker>
<l>Sir, may I own,</l>
<l>If the Acquaintance of a Man of Worth</l>
<l>Be truly valuable, how much more dear</l>
<l>Must his Alliance be, his kindred Virtues?</l>
<l>To have my Understanding form'd, improv'd,</l>
<l>Enlarg'd by his superior Sense; to share</l>
<l>In the Esteem, that's paid him by his Friends,</l>
<l>Or by the public Voice, that speaks his Worth—</l>
<l>If there were such a Man—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DORIMOND.</speaker>
<l>There is, there is.</l>
<l>Whom his own Sex esteems for manly Virtue,</l>
<l>And yours might love for every softer Art,</l>
<l>Which makes that Virtue amiable.</l>
<l>But as the highest Proof how dear I hold him,</l>
<l>(For Nature bids me love him, as my Kinsman)</l>
<l>I dare to trust him with EUGENIA's Happiness.</l>

<l>Then take him from my Hand, my Heart, my Judgment,</l>

<l>It was not in the Power of Artifice,</l>
<l>Sure not in my Simplicity to hide,</l>
<l>Or to disguise it. While my Tongue stopp'd, faultering,</l>
<l>Unknowing how to answer; every Feature</l>
<l>Too strongly told th' Aversion of my Soul.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ORPHISA.</speaker>
<l>Whence this Aversion? In the World's Opinion,</l>
<l>(Which seldom judges wrong, when it commends)</l>
<l>MERCOUR has Merit; an extensive Knowledge,</l>
<l>In Letters and in Men, with every Elegance,</l>
<l>That's form'd and polish'd by the Arts of Courts.</l>
<l>May I not fear, that MERCOUR's greatest Fault</l>
<l>Is CLERVAL's being amiable?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIA.</speaker>
<l>No, Madam.</l>
<l>It is not that my Judgment disesteems him.</l>
<l>There's somewhat in him, that my Nature starts at,</l>

<speaker>ORPHISA.</speaker>
<l>I do; I must; without your Father's Knowledge.</l>
<l>The Maid, who loves her Innocence, should blush</l>
<l>If e'er her wandering Eye excite the Hope</l>
<l><pb n="22" facs="27"/>
Of secret Love; 'tis ev'n a Crime to please,</l>
<l>Which Virtue startles at. Oh! would EUGENIA</l>
<l>Exert the Spirit of Virtue; let the Sense</l>
<l>Of filial Piety inspire her Breast,</l>
<l>And at the Marriage-Altar offer up</l>
<l>The Passions of the Heart; that noblest Sacrifice,</l>
<l>Worthy of her, of Virtue, and of Heaven—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUGENIA.</speaker>
<l>And will high Heaven be mock'd with such a Sacrifice?</l>
<l>And shall I give my Hand, that sacred Pledge</l>
<l>Of Love and Truth, to him my Soul abhors?</l>
<l>Shall I deceive even him? Shall I profane</l>
<l>The Altar and its Rites with Vows of Falshood?</l>
<l>There shall I learn Dissimulation? there</l>
<l>First speak a Language, foreign to my Heart?</l>
<l>Ye blessed Saints and Angels, shall ye hear</l>
<l>My unhallow'd Lips pronounce the solemn Promise</l>

<l>All holy Things forbid. I durst not think it.</l>

<l>The generous DORIMOND—For I no more,</l>

<l>Beneath its Weight. Frighted, I call'd for Help,</l>

<l>Our Actions are our own; their Consequence</l>

<l>I will indulge to Nature, and her Sorrows.</l>
<l>I never shall have Cause to weep again,</l>
<l>And I'll enjoy it now.</l>
</sp>

<l>Unnerve its Strength, and sink it to Despair.</l>

<l>Why should I not despair? Have I not lost,</l>

<l>Can Virtue stain it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MERCOUR.</speaker>
<l>Yes, the vulgar Virtue,</l>
<l>Which low-born Spirits practise. This ORPHISA—</l>
<l>This Governess—and well she fill'd her Station,</l>
<l>For she was equal to it—Say, what Virtues</l>
<l>Can take their Rise from her? Is the Source foul,</l>
<l>And can the Stream be pure? But you're a Lover,</l>
<l>And Love can change th' unerring Course of Nature.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLERVAL.</speaker>
<l>And yet, till this unhappy Morn, your Heart,</l>
<l>Your Tongue, at least, confess'd EUGENIA's Merit.</l>
<l>Like me, you saw her with a Lover's Eye.</l>
<l>But the perverse and haughty Maid, it seems,</l>

<l>(Whose Bosoms beat with Passions, which they feel not)</l>

<l>Gave Way to my Resentment, and with Threats—</l>

<lg>
<l>OF all the various Wonders Wit can do,</l>
<l>(Whether to please the Many, or the Few)</l>
<l>None charms an Audience—like a Stroke, that's new.</l>
<l>Now this choice Secret found, I dare engage,</l>
<l>Has brought our solemn Champion to the Stage,</l>
<l>As if, to reach this Merit, were no more,</l>
<l>Than just to write—as none e'er wrote before.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Why here's a Play now—of what Kind to call it</l>
<l>I know no more than—of what will befal it—</l>
<l>Whether the <hi>Critics</hi> Praise—or bolder <hi>Bucks</hi> shall maul it;</l>
<l>In <hi>France</hi> 'twas Comedy; but here 'tis Tragic!</l>
<l>And all by dint of pure poetic Magic—</l>
<l>Mistake me not, I don't by this aver;</l>
<l>That <hi>ev'ry</hi> Poet is a Conjurer;</l>
<l>Ours is all Sentiment, blank Verse, and Virtue,</l>
<l>Distress—But yet no Bloodshed to divert ye.</l>
<l>Such Plays in <hi>France</hi> perhaps may cut a Figure;</l>
<l>But to our Critics here they're mere <hi>Soup-meagre;</hi></l>
<l>Tho' there they never stain their Stage with Blood;</l>
<l>Yet <hi>English</hi> Stomachs love substantial Food.</l>
<l>Give us! the Lightning's Blaze, the Thunder's Roll!</l>
<l>The pointed Dagger, and the pois'ning Bowl!</l>
<l>Let Drums and Trumpets Clangor swell the Scene,</l>
<l>Till the gor'd Battle bleed in ev'ry Vein.</l>
<l>We love the Muses animating Spark,</l>
<l>Till Gods meet Gods and justle in the Dark!</l>
<l>This now did something in the Days of Yore,</l>
<l>When Lungs heroic made the Galleries roar.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>As for our Bard, the fatal Die is thrown,</l>
<l>And now the Question is—What says the Town,</l>
<l>Has he thrown in, or is the Dupe undone?</l>
<l>Yet on your Justice boldly he relied,</l>
<l>No Party form'd, no partial Friendship tried.</l>
<l>Tho' Love of Praise his inmost Soul inflame,</l>
<l>All feign'd, or forc'd Applause he dares disclaim,</l>
<l>Your Candour—no—Your Judgment be his Fame.</l>
