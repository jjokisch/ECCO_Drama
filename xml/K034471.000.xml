<byline>Spoken by Mr. BENSLEY.</byline>
<lg>
<l>TELL me, ye Gods, ye arbiters of wit,</l>
<l>Who rule the heavens, or who lead the pit, <stage>addressing the gallery and pit,</stage></l>
<l>Whence comes it, in an age refin'd by taste</l>
<l>By science polish'd, and by judgement chaste,</l>
<l>We see the Muse, in dignity sublime,</l>
<l>Led on by prologue, ape-ing <hi>pantomime;</hi></l>
<l>Whose sportive fancy, and whose comic skill,</l>
<l>All must applaud—where <hi>Roscius</hi> guides the quill;</l>
<l>Yet when <hi>Melpomene</hi> in grief appears,</l>
<l>Her suff'ring virtue bath'd in sorrow's tears,</l>
<l>From Tyrant laws, or jealous love oppress'd,</l>
<l>Swelling with silence in her tortur'd breast.</l>
<l>How can the heart her genial impulse shew,</l>
<l>Feel as she feels, or weep another's woe;</l>
<l>When gay <hi>Thalia</hi> has so late possess'd</l>
<l>The laughing transports of the human breast?</l>
<l>Let each her province keep, let jocund mirth</l>
<l>To Epilogue alone give happy birth;</l>
<l>Ease the struck soul from ev'ry anxious fcar,</l>
<l>And wipe from beauty's check the silent tear.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Twice <hi>Metastasio</hi>'s wings have borne our Bayes,</l>
<l>And safely brought him o'er the critic seas;</l>
<l>Fir'd with success, he dares this awful night,</l>
<l>Cheer'd by your smiles to take a bolder flight;</l>
<l>Nor longer stoop beneath a foreign shade,</l>
<l>Like Dian shining from a borrow'd aid;</l>
<l>But comes impregnate with <hi>Icarian</hi> pride,</l>
<l>To stretch his pinnions, and forsake his guide;</l>
<l>Yet doubtful flies, lest vapours damp his force,</l>
<l>And one black cloud should stop his airy course,</l>
<l>To awful heights his proud ambition soars,</l>
<l>And the dread regions of applause explores;</l>
<l><pb facs="3"/>
No sun he fears—but courts its warmest ray</l>
<l>'Tis yours to raise—or sink him in the sea.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Let <hi>Candour</hi> then proceed to try the cause,</l>
<l>That <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of dramatic laws!</l>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by a Friend, to have been spoken in the character of the Tragic Muse.</byline>
<p>Designed for Mrs. BARRY.</p>
<lg>
<l>JUDGES of Genius! from whose hands a bard</l>
<l>This night awaits the laurel of reward!</l>
<l>To you, the Tragic Muse, in <hi>Britain</hi>'s name,</l>
<l>Comes to announce the merits of his claim.</l>
<l>'Tis I have led him timorous to this field,</l>
<l>And bade him dare his country's guantlet wield;</l>
<l>Bade him aspire to vault her fiery breed,</l>
<l>Nor humbly stoop to mount the manag'd steed.</l>
<l>Long had I seen his patient merit toil,</l>
<l>In culling chaplets from a foreign soil;</l>
<l>Whilst, here, transplanted by his skilful hand,</l>
<l>Italia's honours bloom'd in <hi>Albion</hi>'s land.</l>
<l>Long had I mark'd, as such exotic boughs</l>
<l>Content he wove to veil his modest brows,</l>
<l>A spirit that in paths untrod before</l>
<l>Might snatch the nobler foliage of this shore.</l>
<l>Pleas'd with the hopes, that I had now descry'd</l>
<l>A future son, from whom the buskin's pride</l>
<l>To this my favourite Isle, again might rise;</l>
<l>I touch'd his ear, and pointed out the prize.</l>
<l>"Wither my honours in this clime (I said)</l>
<l>"Buds here no bounteous leaf to deck thy head?</l>
<l>"Are these once fosiering skies so over-cast,</l>
<l>"That Genius dares not brave th' inclement blast?</l>
<l>"Come, let me lead thee, where my sons of yore</l>
<l>"In Fancy's fields amass'd their laureate store;</l>
<l><pb facs="4"/>
"With active powers, aloft, bestrode the clouds</l>
<l>"Inspir'd by kind acclaims of shouting crowds.</l>
<l>"Turn thee, where Shakespear wav'd the mystic rod,</l>
<l>"And saw a new creation wait his nod.</l>
<l>"Behold where Terror, with eccentric stride,</l>
<l>"Bursts, like a torrent from the mountain's side!</l>
<l>"Behold where gentle pity heaves the sigh,</l>
<l>"Sluicing the fruitful conduit of the eye!</l>
<l>"See love at whose approach, the airy Wiles</l>
<l>"Of Mirth and Freedom, or the jocund Smiles</l>
<l>"Of sweet content, dispers'd in wild affright,</l>
<l>"Mount on their silken wings and take their flight.</l>
<l>"See Jealousy his hideous form uprear,</l>
<l>"Tine the quick brand, and shake the vengeful spear:</l>
<l>"While, close behind, fell Anguish aud Disdain</l>
<l>"Stalk sullen by; and swell his gloomy train.</l>
<l>"Mark where Despair points to some distant ground;</l>
<l>"On blasted yews, where Night-birds shrick around,</l>
<l>"Where yawning Tombs add horror to the night,</l>
<l>"And Meteors flash their momentary light.</l>
<l>"Here mark thyself, what various objects rise,</l>
<l>"Nor trust the medium of another's eyes.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>I spoke—and Genius strait began to spread</l>
<l>His ready Plumage, and my voice obey'd,</l>
<l>Adventurous, thence he dares this night aspire</l>
<l>To stamp the vivid scene with native fire.</l>
<l>'Tis yours, ye Britons, then, with kind applause,</l>
<l>To fan the flame I kindled in your cause:</l>
<l>Nor be it said, when on your mercy thrown,</l>
<l>You foster every spark, but what's your own.</l>
<l>From your dread sentence, crown'd with laurels won,</l>
<l>I ardently expect to greet a Son:</l>
<l>The Palm I have deposited with you,</l>
<l>And trust your hearts to give it where 'tis due.</l>

<stage>TERAMENES, AGENOR.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>TERAMENES.</speaker>
<l>AGENOR, still Bithynia must retain</l>
<l>The sword unsheath'd, and still remov'd afar,</l>
<l>Shall Peace, in vain desir'd, mock every hope,</l>
<l>Of dear domestic happiness—the leagues</l>
<l>Of factious princes, whose associate force</l>
<l>Has vex'd this bleeding land, now yield indeed</l>
<l>To Lycomedes' arms, or rather shrink</l>
<l>Before the genius of your noble friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agen.</speaker>
<l>Arsetes, bred in distant realms, and long</l>
<l>A wanderer o'er the face of earth, must hail</l>
<l>The hour that led his steps to tread your soil,</l>
<l>And gave him Teramenes for his friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tera.</speaker>
<l>Tho' now the rage of civil strife is past,</l>
<l>Full well thou know'st, to-morrow's sun declin'd,</l>
<l>His next returning beam lights up the day</l>
<l>That ends the truce with Pontus, and demands</l>
<l>Our strongest force to meet a mightier foe,</l>
<l>In Artabasus.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agen.</speaker>
<l>Five returning suns</l>
<l>Have chang'd your vernal groves, since as the breath</l>
<l>Of Fame declares, your armies met and fought</l>
<l>On Hippias' banks, what time your martial powers</l>
<l>(Forgive me, if report mislead my tongue,)</l>
<l>Bow'd to a foreign standard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tera.</speaker>
<l>Lycomedes,</l>
<l>Whose thirst of glory in his vigorous life</l>
<l>Compell'd the neighbouring states to bend beneath</l>
<l>Bithynia's yoke; when creeping time had clogg'd</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="7"/>
The vital springs, and kept his age from scenes,</l>
<l>Of active valour, by his generals still</l>
<l>Maintain'd the field, and thro' the nations spread</l>
<l>His martial terrors, till that fatal day,</l>
<l>When Hippias, down his current, dy'd with blood,</l>
<l>The frequent corse and glittering ensign bore:</l>
<l>Then, midst the slaughter, fell a sacrifice</l>
<l>To iron war, our king's lamented son;</l>
<l>A youth, the early darling of his sire,</l>
<l>The soldier's hope, and nursling of the field.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agen.</speaker>
<l>Oft have I heard Polemon's name, whose brave</l>
<l>Unpractis'd arm encounter'd Artabasus,</l>
<l>And from his sword receiv'd a glorious death.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tera.</speaker>
<l>But tho' the time's necessity compell'd</l>
<l>Bithynia to the truce, still, still the thought</l>
<l>Of his Polemon rankled in the bosom</l>
<l>Of our afflicted monarch, still the hope,</l>
<l>Tho' distant hope of vengeance, glow'd within,</l>
<l>And fed eternal hatred in his soul.</l>
<l>While now to Pontus' bounds, his army spreads</l>
<l>Its conquering legions, he forgoes the state</l>
<l>Of Nicomedias' palace, to reside</l>
<l>Amidst this city, whose opposing bulwarks</l>
<l>Rise on the kingdom's edge, and dare the foe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agen.</speaker>
<l>Fame speaks your rival great, and gives the praise</l>
<l>Of might and wisdom to the king of Pontus;</l>
<l>And more, 'tis said, his son, amidst the files</l>
<l>Of Rome's immortal legions, distant far</l>
<l>From Pontus, learns the rugged trade of war,</l>
<l>And gathers laurels in his blooming age,</l>
<l>That veterans view with envy: his return</l>
<l>Gives earnest of new triumphs.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tera.</speaker>
<l>Let him come;</l>
<l>Would yet Arsetes aid Bithynia's cause</l>
<l>His sword with brave Orontes join'd, whose hand</l>
<l>Must sway the scepter of Bithynia's realm,</l>
<l>Might fix th' unsteady wing of victory</l>
<l>To Lycomedes' bands.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agen.</speaker>
<l>Orontes' valour</l>
<l>Your sovereign deems to merit Cleonice,</l>
<l>Whose piety forsakes the pomp of courts,</l>
<l>The splendid ease of female life, to attend</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="8"/>
A father's steps, amidst the clang of war.</l>
<l>But for Arsetes, thou rememberest well</l>
<l>When first he join'd to thine his social arms,</l>
<l>He pledg'd his faith for five returning moons</l>
<l>To abide your welcome guest, and now the tenth</l>
<l>Wanes in her silver orb.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tera.</speaker>
<l>What says Agenor?</l>
<l>My mind, tho' loth, recalls each circumstance.</l>
<l>But still I hop'd Arsetes might be won</l>
<l>To breathe our friendly air, still mix'd among</l>
<l>Bithynia's warlike sons, now hovering o'er</l>
<l>The verge of hostile Pontus, when the time</l>
<l>And place concurr'd to pour with sudden inroad</l>
<l>The storm of conquest on our hated foe,</l>
<l>To avenge a form, a worth so like his own—</l>
<l>—But see, he comes—</l>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ARSETES.</stage>
<l>Belov'd Arsetes, welcome!</l>
<l>Youth, at thy presence, buds with bloom renew'd,</l>
<l>Such as I was, when, on Arabia's sands,</l>
<l>I crush'd the wandering robbers of the desert.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arse.</speaker>
<l>My lord, too partial friendship ever finds</l>
<l>New praise for your Arsetes; if I claim</l>
<l>Of merit aught, here Heaven receive my thanks,</l>
<l>That bade me wield the sword for Lycomedes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tera.</speaker>
<l>And yet Arsetes now methinks forgets</l>
<l>To prize our country's honours; while the bond</l>
<l>Of friendship holds no more his changing heart;</l>
<l>That heart, which once I press'd with transport here,</l>
<l>Which seem'd with mutual transport to receive</l>
<l>The love I proffer'd, when my bosom glow'd</l>
<l>With warmth of gratitude to him, whose arm</l>
<l>Snatch'd Teramenes from impending death,</l>
<l>As fierce Lysippus aim'd the threatening blade</l>
<l>At my defenceless head, when you rush'd in,</l>
<l>(Till then unknown) and sav'd me from the foe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ars.</speaker>
<l>'Twas sure some happy star, that led my steps</l>
<l>At that blest moment—if I sav'd the life</l>
<l>Of Teramenes, I preserv'd indeed</l>
<l>A faithful counsellor for Lycomedes,</l>
<l>An army's chief, but for myself a friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tera.</speaker>
<l>And wilt thou, my Arsetes, now forsake</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="9"/>
The bands, that late pursued the glorious task</l>
<l>Of conquest, taught by thee—now when the great,</l>
<l>Th' important moment comes, on which depends</l>
<l>Our monarch's fame, our vengeance—led by thee</l>
<l>And brave Orontes, we have stemm'd the tide</l>
<l>Of inbred tumult: every rebel head</l>
<l>Now lies subdued, and flush'd with great success,</l>
<l>Our soldiers now demand, with loud acclaim,</l>
<l>To pour their fury o'er yon hostile bounds,</l>
<l>Beneath Arsetes and Orontes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arse.</speaker>
<l>Heaven</l>
<l>Be witness here, compulsive honour long</l>
<l>Has chanlleng'd my departure—yet, till now</l>
<l>I wav'd obedience to the frequent calls</l>
<l>Of duty; but the flame of civil broils</l>
<l>At length subsiding thro' your troubled state,</l>
<l>I must (forgive me, chief, forgive me, friend,)</l>
<l>Yield to the powerful voice, and quit Bithynia.</l>
<l>By every toil my sword has known in battle,</l>
<l>But most the toils I shar'd with Teramenes,</l>
<l>Unwilling and compell'd, I leave your clime,</l>
<l>And quit a country dearer than my own.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tera.</speaker>
<l>Farewell, Arsetes; think that Teramenes</l>
<l>Feels from his in most soul the fix'd resolve</l>
<l>Of him, whom once he fondly deem'd by fortune,</l>
<l>From all mankind selected for his friend.</l>
<l>I'll seek the king—no less will he regret</l>
<l>Arsetes' loss, whose presence might insure</l>
<l>His wish'd revenge, and fix his kingdoms glory.</l>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
<stage>ARSETES, AGENOR.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Agen.</speaker>
<l>Why droops Arsetes? O! discover all</l>
<l>Thy secret grief and let Agenor share it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arse.</speaker>
<l>Indeed thou dost—my every thought is thine,</l>
<l>My other self, my bosom's counsellor!</l>
<l>What needs there more to rend my heart, to fill</l>
<l>My tortur'd soul, while loitering here I wrong</l>
<l>My native soil, the voice of filial duty</l>
<l>Chides my delay, yet Love, the powerful God</l>
<l>Reigns in my breast, and mocks each settled purpose:</l>
<l>Come, my Agenor, with thy friendly aid</l>
<l>Confirm my thoughts, and teach me yet to tread,</l>
<l>Yet to resume the path my seet have left;</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="10"/>
To quit the land, where all my joys are center'd,</l>
<l>To tear myself from love and Cleonice—</l>
<l>—O! never!—never—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agen.</speaker>
<l>Yet again reflect,</l>
<l>Think who you are, to what has Heaven reserv'd</l>
<l>Your virtues—Shall a kingdom's heir—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arse.</speaker>
<l>Go on—</l>
<l>'Tis honest chiding—Shall a kingdom's heir,</l>
<l>(Thus would'st thou say) on whom th' expecting eyes</l>
<l>Of thousands look for happiness, on whom</l>
<l>A father fixes every dearest hope</l>
<l>To see himself renew'd to distant times,</l>
<l>Shall he, forgetting all the claims of glory,</l>
<l>Forgetting all the ties of filial duty,</l>
<l>Defraud his longing people of their prince,</l>
<l>And from his sire with-hold a darling son?</l>
<l>Say—shall Bithynia's hostile lands detain,</l>
<l>From Artabasus' sight his loved Pharnaces?</l>
<l>O! no—Agenor—thou hast fir'd my soul;</l>
<l>My father!—yes, I will embrace the knees</l>
<l>Of him, whose love reproaches my delay.</l>
<l>Yet never, Cleonice, shall this breast</l>
<l>Forget its wonted flame:—Is it a crime</l>
<l>To adore the sum of all her sex's graces,</l>
<l>Tho' wayward chance has plac'd the hopeless bar</l>
<l>Of lineal enmity between our loves?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agen.</speaker>
<l>And yet, my prince; the indulgent hand of fate,</l>
<l>Perchance may weave your future web of life</l>
<l>With threads of brighter dye; even love itself</l>
<l>May find a way to clear the gloomy prospect:</l>
<l>Discord perhaps may once again extinguish</l>
<l>Her hated torch that fires the rival nations,</l>
<l>And Cleonice be the bond of peace:</l>
<l>Too long, already, strangers have we lived,</l>
<l>Alien from friends and home: tho' Artabasus</l>
<l>Sent you beneath my father's guardian care,</l>
<l>To learn hard lessons in the school of glory,</l>
<l>Yet sure the parent suffer'd in that absence,</l>
<l>Which, as a king, his virtue deem'd would raise</l>
<l>Your fame, and fit you for a people's weal.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arse.</speaker>
<l>Yes, my Agenor, oft his tenderest greetings</l>
<l>Have warn'd me to return, when circling time</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="11"/>
Had brought the period fix'd for my departure;</l>
<l>Or when the pause of arms, or honour's duty</l>
<l>Permitted me to quit the host of Rome.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agen.</speaker>
<l>And yet—my prince—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arse.</speaker>
<l>And yet—too true, Agenor,</l>
<l>I feel each just reproach—the land indeed</l>
<l>I left, and journey'd o'er a length of soil,</l>
<l>When fate (for sure 'twas more than common fortune)</l>
<l>Prompted my steps to tread Bithynia's realm,</l>
<l>Where Lycomedes wag'd intestine war</l>
<l>With rebel arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agen.</speaker>
<l>Thy generous valour then,</l>
<l>Warm'd by the common cause of kings, to assert</l>
<l>A prince's rights, forgot thy country's foe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arse.</speaker>
<l>Full well thou know'st I vow'd to every God,</l>
<l>By all the solemn ties that bind mankind,</l>
<l>Ne'er to reveal, while in this hostile land</l>
<l>My country or my birth; this, urg'd by thee,</l>
<l>I swore, when first I told thee my design,</l>

<l>A father's nature</l>

<l>Receive this pledge of friendship—still be thine</l>
<l>Bithynia's crown, nor claim I aught from conquest</l>
<l><pb n="53" facs="52"/>
But mutual peace—some other time shall tell</l>
<l>This work of fate—But who shall search the ways</l>
<l>Of Heaven inscrutable, or dare to question</l>
<l>Why the same power beheld Polemon fall,</l>
<l>And sav'd Pharnaces for a father's love?</l>
<l>'Tis ours with humble praise to take from Jove</l>
<l>The cordial draught of joy, nor murmur when</l>
<l>He deals the cup of woe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lyco.</speaker>
<l>O, Artabasus!</l>
<l>No longer now my foe—this honour'd hand,</l>
<l>This hand now free from my Polemon's death,</l>
<l>Confirm the brother's union—balmy peace</l>
<l>Rest with his manes, and remembrance ever</l>
<l>With odorous praise surround his laurell'd tomb!</l>
<l>But yet I have a son—in thee he lives,</l>
<l>Lives in Pharnaces— <stage>[embraces]</stage> —Yes; my more than brother,</l>
<l>Our friendship knit shall plant the welcome olives</l>
<l>Thro' both our lands, and bless their sons with peace!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phar:</speaker>
<l>It must, it must—some genius whispers now</l>
<l>Oblivion to my cares, and bright-wing'd Hope,</l>
<l>Like Cleonice, points my soul to bliss!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lyco.</speaker>
<l>If bliss be Cleonice, she is yours.</l>

<l>My daughter—every God</l>
<l>Propitious smile to crown your virtuous love!</l>

<l>Speak, Cleonice! does thy heart refuse</l>
<l>To own the mighty rapture?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cleon.</speaker>
<l>O, Pharnaces!</l>
<l>Think how my bosom throbs with various tumult</l>
<l>Of mingled joy and grief—My brother's fate</l>
<l>Still labours here, 'spite of the bliss that fills</l>
<l>My conscious heart; for bliss it is to avow</l>
<l>My boundless passion—wife of my Pharnaces,</l>
<l>Or rather that dear name which first subdu'd</l>
<l>My virgin heart—my ever-lov'd Arsetes!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lyco.</speaker>
<l>To thee, my son Pharnaces, I resign</l>
<l>Bithynia's crown, while I, retir'd in ease,</l>
<l>Steal gently down the peaceful vale of life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arta</speaker>
<l>Behold the latent treason brought to light!</l>
<l>Tho' hid from mortal eye, the Eternal Mind</l>
<l>Pervades the deepest gloom—Confess, my brother,</l>
<l><pb n="54" facs="53"/>
The dazzling meteor that misled thy youth,</l>
<l>And even seduc'd thy age: the monarch fir'd</l>
<l>With false ambition for a conqueror's name,</l>
<l>Is but the lash of Jove to scourge mankind.</l>
<l>For thee, my son, by Lycomedes rais'd</l>
<l>To guide, with early hand, the reins of empire,</l>
<l>Remember what the duty of a king</l>
<l>Exacts, while each domestic bliss shall crown</l>
<l>Thy private hours, to watch thy people's weal,</l>
<l>And share, like Heaven, thy happiness with all.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. BULKLEY.</byline>
<lg>
<l>OUR author, all submission, sends me here,</l>
<l>To make excuses for your simple cheer;</l>
<l>And I, that have no interest in his scenes,</l>
<l>Must bear the train of tragic kings and queens.</l>
<l>Shall I support the weakness of his Muse?—</l>
<l>Egad—if so—I'll fit him with abuse—</l>
<l>I'll soon dissect his fine-spun work, and show</l>
<l>That all his plot has more of farce than woe.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>For, after all, the creature's much deceiv'd,</l>
<l>If e'er he thinks his tale can be believ'd.</l>
<l>So tame and so inanimate his maid is—</l>
<l>How very different from our modern ladies!—</l>
<l>What, could a blooming lass with ripen'd charms,</l>
<l>Be held so long from her admirer's arms?—</l>
<l>If such were truths in prudish Heathen climes,</l>
<l>Examples vary in our later times—</l>
<l>Then for theatric play—how poor! how cold!</l>
<l>A heroine's language should be nobly bold,</l>
<l>Outstrip the decency of vulgar life,</l>
<l>Mouth at the Heavens, and set the Gods at strife.—</l>
<l>Time was indeed, an antiquated bard</l>
<l>Paid to that beldame, Nature, some regard,</l>
<l>And drew his females with such simple features,</l>
<l>That all, who saw, believ'd them human creatures.</l>
<l>Plain <hi>Desdemona</hi> bore no trace of art,</l>
<l>And <hi>Portia</hi> play'd a wife's domestic part;</l>
<l>While <hi>Constance</hi> shew'd, but what before we knew,</l>
<l>And only griev'd, as real mothers do.—</l>
<l>Shall this stale poet give the Drama law,</l>
<l>Who poorly copied only what he saw?</l>
<l>Nay, stole from life, in every clime and age,</l>
<l>The characters that fill his boasted page?—</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="55"/>
<l>Well! as I live, 'tis he!<stage>—(looking out)—</stage>O, axe you come?</l>
<l>Does all go well?—poor devil!—seal his doom.</l>
<l>This live-long night he watches every eye,</l>
<l>Talks, like his heroes, in soliloquy—</l>
<l>Then starts aside—"What! something goes amiss?—</l>
<l>"Sure 'tis the distant murmur of a hiss!"—</l>
<l>Alas! kind soul!—I pity his condition,</l>
<l>And will in his behalf this House petition:—</l>
<l>To you, good folks above, for ever ready</l>
<l>To serve a friend, all English hearts and steady!</l>
<l>To you, ye men of candour, sense, and wit,</l>
<l>Who fill the circle of this awful pit;</l>
<l>To you, ye ladies, ever prone to spare</l>
<l>The bard, who love and beauty makes his care;</l>
<l>I here commend him—take him to your favour,</l>
<l>And I'll be surety for his good behaviour.</l>
