<p>FALSTAFF'S WEDDING, A COMEDY: AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</p>
<p>BEING A SEQUEL TO THE SECOND PART OF THE PLAY OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH.</p>
<p>WRITTEN IN IMITATION OF SHAKESPEARE, BY W. KENRICK.</p>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THE success, which a juvenile sketch of this Play hath met with in publication, having induced the Author to bring it on the stage; he flatters himself the alterations, which were thought necessary to accommodate it to a theatrical audience, will not give less satisfaction to the reader than such scenes as he was obliged on that account to reject.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. DODD, in the Character of MERCURY.</byline>
<stage>[Mercury descends from the clouds, flying across the stage: Re-enters, followed by a servant, carrying a counsellor's gown and wig.</stage>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>A LA MERCURE, <hi>equipp'd from top to toe,</hi></l>
<l>My godship's name and quality you know.</l>
<l>Commission'd from Apollo, I come down</l>
<l>T'attend this bench of justices, the town.</l>
<l>Assembled here; all members of the quorum:</l>
<l>To lay a matter of complaint before 'em.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The errand's not in character, 'tis true;</l>
<l>But what our betters bid us, we must do.</l>
<l>Therefore, t'appear with decency at session,</l>
<l>I've stole, you see, the garb of the profession.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>This gown and band belong to serjeant Prig—</l>
<l>And this—our brother Puzzle's learned wig.—</l>
<stage>[Putting on the gown, &amp;c.</stage>
<l>Dress makes the man, Sirs, <hi>vestis virum facit</hi>—</l>
<l>So—now to business—Hem!—<hi>si vestris placet</hi>—</l>
<l>May't please your worships—Forgery, which is grown</l>
<l>To such a height as ne'er before was known—</l>
<l>I say, a forgery hath been committed,</l>
<l>By which king Pluto's mirmidons, outwitted,</l>
<l>Certain choice spirits, in theatric shape,</l>
<l>Have suffer'd from Elisium to escape;</l>
<l>Of Shakespeare's offspring and ideal train,</l>
<l>Sprung, Pallas like, from an immortal brain!</l>
<l>Their names—I have 'em down—but, to be brief,</l>
<l>Shall only just enumerate the chief.</l>
<l>Imprimis, with Madeira swell'd, and sack,</l>
<l>There's Sir John Falstaff, alias call'd Plump Jack;</l>
<l>Next, captain Pistol, a notorious bully;</l>
<l>And Miss Dol Tearsheet, fam'd for jilting cully;</l>
<l>The widow Quickly, vintner, bawd and whore.</l>
<l>With Bardolph, Peto, Nym and—several more;</l>
<l>Link'd in a gang, each cut-purse with his crony,</l>
<l>All arrant thieves and <hi>Dramatis Personae</hi>;</l>
<l>Bent, as suppos'd, to prostitute to shame</l>
<l>Th' aforesaid Shakespeare's honour, name and fame.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>I shall not trespass on your worship's time,</l>
<l>T' explain at full the nature of this crime:</l>
<l>But, Poets having an exclusive right</l>
<l>To bring their mental progeny to light,</l>
<l>This right's invaded by the party 'peach'd;</l>
<l>Who, <hi>vi et armis,</hi> hath th' old bard o'er-reach'd.</l>
<l><pb facs="4"/>By counterfeiting of his hand, do ye see,</l>
<l>Feloniously to set these vagrants free;</l>
<l>With base design t'adopt them for his own,</l>
<l>Tho' Shakespeare's property, and his alone.</l>
<l>Such is the fact.—A critic were an ass,</l>
<l>No doubt, to let such imposition pass;</l>
<l>Nor could a cheat so palpable succeed,</l>
<l>But that the captain of the guard cou'dn't read—</l>
<l>No, not for laughing, tho' to've sav'd his soul;</l>
<l>The scene and circumstances were so d roll.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Pistol, with yellow night-cap patch'd with red,</l>
<l>With Mother Quickly was retir'd to bed;</l>
<l>And, waking, swore, by Styx, he would not come,</l>
<l>Sans preparation, pike and beat of drum.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Of <hi>aqua-vitae</hi> having stole a flaggon,</l>
<l>Bardolph and Nym were playing at snap-dragon;</l>
<l>Sometimes proceeding from hard words to blows,</l>
<l>As by mistake Nym seiz'd on Bardolph's nose.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>With Falstaff sat Dol Tearsheet, cheek by joll,</l>
<l>And while she buss'd his chin and scratch'd his poll,</l>
<l>Slipp'd from his thumb his grandfire's copper ring,</l>
<l>For love, not for the value, of the thing:</l>
<l>Then stole his empty purse; but no abuse;</l>
<l>'T was only done to keep her hand in use:</l>
<l>He swearing, he'd be damn'd as soon as trust his</l>
<l>Round belly more with Hall, or his chief-justice.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But this is wandering from the point.—They're here,</l>
<l>And on your summons ready to appear:</l>
<l>Please to proceed then to examination;</l>
<l>And be attentive to their information.</l>
<l>If, as your judgment cannot be erroneous,</l>
<l>You take this forgery to be felonious,</l>
<l>The author meaning fraud, I need not mention</l>
<l>Your issuing warrants for his apprehension;</l>
<l>And when you've caught and into pieces tore him,</l>
<l>Hang up his mangled carcase <hi>in terrorem</hi>;</l>
<l>In flagrant crimes the process should be short;</l>
<l>The law is clear—I leave it with the court.</l>

<stage>Enter Sir JOHN FALSTAFF, solus.</stage>
<sp>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT a scurvy quarter is this? Not a bush, or a blind Cupid, in the neighbourhood! 'sblood, my legs will fail me ere I reach a tavern. Phoo—Phoo—It is some comfort, however, I escap'd with my life. The green-apron'd rascals, crouding after the procession, had well nigh made an end of me.</p>

<head>SCENE II.</head>
<stage>Enter BARDOLPH.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>O, Sir John, I'm glad I have found ye. I was in the fearfullest quandary for you in the world. I hope your honour has got no hurt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Not its death's wound, I hope; though Hal, indeed, look'd somewhat cold upon me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Cold, Sir John! I am a-fear'd we shall be in limbo shortly: for my Lord-chief-justice—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="7"/>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Hold thy ill-omen'd croaking. If faithful services are thus requited, I will turn cordwainer; yea, cobler, and heel piece old shoes, ere I have to do with blood-royal again. Ingratitude! I hate it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>To be sure, Sir John, what you say is right; for, as the song says, ingratitude is worse than the sin of witchcraft. But I hop'd your honour got no personable harm in the mob: you was carried off the terras, for all the world, like a danghil from Mill-bank by a spring-tide.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Bardolph, away with thy filthy comparisons! I am ill at ease, and more dispos'd to spleen than to merriment. I prythee, look out, and see if there be a bawdy-house at hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>What here, so near the court, Sir John?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Where better? 'Sblood, dost think there are no whores at Court? Are there no dames of honour? Dost think Hal hath banish'd them too? Look out, look out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>I will, Sir John.</p>

<head>SCENE III.</head>
<stage>Sir JOHN FALSTAFF, solus.</stage>
<sp>
<p>I would I were in East-cheap. Mine hostess hath a most excellent cordial; and I never stood in more need of it than now. The gross indignity Hal hath put on me, sticks in my throat; and, in the end, may go near to choak me. I shall never gulp it down: that's flat: unless, indeed, a full cup of sherris help to clear the way. And then, how I shall stomach it; how I shall digest it, heaven knows! At present, both my person and knighthood are in jeopardy; my Lord-chief-justice, to whose care I am commended, holding me not altogether in good liking. But no matter—if I am to be provided for, what avails it who is my caterer? I could wish, nevertheless, old white wine stood higher in his Lordship's favour; that I may not be stinted at table, or in my by-drinkings. I like notsuch splenetic temperaments; such phlegmatic constitutions; grey-beards, that never make allowances for the continual waste of radical moisture.—'Sblood,
<pb n="3" facs="8"/>
I am as foundered and as sore as a blind horse in a mill.—Bardolph! where a plague art thou gotten to, caterwauling?</p>

<head>SCENE IV.</head>
<stage>Enter Mrs. QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>O, Sir John Falstaff!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doll.</speaker>
<p>O, sweet Sir John!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>How! mine hostess, and my good vestal Mrs. Tearsheet! save ye gentlewomen both, good-morrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Host.</speaker>
<p>Godild ye, Sir John—well I vow and protest an I didn't say he would take as civil notice of his old acquaintance: nay, tho'f he was created by my lord-mayor of London.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doll.</speaker>
<p>What talk ye of lord-mayors and fusty citizens, gossip Quickly? Sir John is a courtier, and to be sure we must gratulate him now as one of the greatest knights in the nation.—O sweet Sir John!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Truce with your formalities, Mrs. Dorothy. Pray, have you seen none of our followers by the way? Pistol, nor Peto!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>No verily, Sir John, not one.—We have seen nothing of any of them to day. They are all gone to the coronation, I warrant; and indeed we should have been there too, hadn't it been for that wicked villain, constable Fang, that, by a mistake of the beadle of our ward, would have carried us to Bridewel this morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>How! mine hostess and my fair Dorothy to Bidewel!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Even to Bridewel, I can assure ye.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>But how; how? dame Quickly to Bridewel! a decent church-going widow and a modest maiden, I should say, single gentlewoman, to a house of correction! why, what—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>So I said, Sir John. Nuthook, Nuthook, says I, do you know what you do, says I?—Have me to Bridewell, says I,—I say to Bridewel indeed! a ruptable house

keeper, that has paid scot and lot, and born the burthen of half the parish any time these twenty years.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>That thou hast, hostess; of the male half, I'll be sworn for thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Besides, says I, do you know Sir John Falstaff! says I.—Touch a hair of Mrs. Dorothy's head, says I, and Sir John will make you smart for it, says I, ev'ry bone in your skin, says I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>And what said the rascal to that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Said, Sir John! he stood mumchance, and spoke never a living syllable, but set his vinegar-visag'd catchpoles upon us; who fastened their claws into Mrs. Tearsheet's best kirtle, and tore it into as many rents and tatters, as there were in the old tapestry hangings I pawn'd to fit your honour out for the last expedition.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>Yes indeed, Sir John, made a mere tatterdemallion of me. But we did so tongue the leather-ear'd vultures—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>That they were glad to loose their gripe to get rid of you, I suppose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir John, I was obliged to perduce an angel to convince them we were not the parties indicted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Infidel rogues! would nothing less than the testimony of an angel convince them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Ay, I knew how Sir John would take it. O, how soundly will the knave constable be swing'd for this! a jack-in-office rascal! we shall cure the blue-skin'd runnion of his itch for whipping, I warrant ye.</p>
</sp>
</div3>
<div3 n="5" type="scene">
<head>SCENE V.</head>
<stage>Re-enter BARDOLPH.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Bard.</speaker>
<p>I have been looking all about, Sir John, but I cannot find one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>What is it Sir John wants, Mr. Bardolph?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>A bawdy-house, mistress.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>O Jesu-Maria! Mrs. Dorothy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>How, sirrah! what call'st thou a bawdy-house
<pb n="5" facs="10"/>
I sent thee to look out for a house of civil entertainment, where I might repose myself after my fatigue? Why, what, you rogue, would you make of me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Marry come up indeed! a bawdy-house truly! but as to a house of civil entertainment, Sir John; here is one hard by, where the knights and lords, and all the great gentlemen of the court, are entertained, both by night and by day, as civilly as at their own homes; and by gentlewomen as kind to them, I warrant ye, as their own ladies themselves.—A house of civil entertainment, a bawdy-house! Why, I keep a house of civility myself, and I would have you to know Mr. Bardolph—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, 'tis all one: what Sir John pleases.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Yes, by my truly, and so I think it ought, for if Sir John recommends you to the king—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>Nay, were I Sir John, I'm sure I would never promote such a clown as Bardolph at court.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Ah! Dol, Dol, I am afraid our promotion will be at the gallows. If Sir John has any interest with the hangman, he may get me preferr'd, perhaps, to the top of the ladder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>Why, how now varlet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Do you hear? do you hear, sweet Sir John?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Ay, hostess, Bardolph is somewhat blunt: but, as for the king—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Heav'ns bless him! a sweet young prince he was; and, to be sure, a gracious king he is. But what of him, Sir John?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Why, marry,—hang him, hostess—Treason must out as well as murder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>I am 'maz'd Sir John; why, how is this? what a goodness! when—where—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>How is this, good Bardolph?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Why, I will tell ye how it is. That same ungrateful, speaking, pitiful rascal, we are speaking of, is turn'd fanatick.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Fanatick! the king a fanatick!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Ay, fanatick, presbyter, bishop, if you will. Let his crown be his mitre; I care not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>We don't take your meaning, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>You must know then, Dol, that after having, in pure love and affection, ridden post day and night fourscore and odd miles, to congratulate him on his accession, and condole with him on his father's death; instead of bidding me welcome to court, he preached me my own funeral sermon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>A funeral sermon!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Ay, hostess: for at the end of his discourse he order'd me to be buried alive, at ten miles distance from the court. And, to make this unnatural interment the surer, he has appointed my Lord-chief-justice his undertaker, to see to the disposal of my corpse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Buried alive, quoth he! what, what is in all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>In plain terms, dame Quickly, your gracious king hath banished me the presence; and, till he grows a graceless prince again, I am forbidden to approach his person, within ten miles, on penalty of being hang'd, Take ye me now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>O Jesu! is it possitable?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>Ah, ha! is it so? sits the wind in that quarter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Well, as I am an honest woman, who would have thought it? it is a world to see!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>And so, Sir John is in disgrace; still plain Jack Falstaff and one of us! ha! ha! ha! poor blown Jack!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>A sad disappointment, indeed, Sir John! but, in good faith, things fall out so odd, and the world goes so wrong, and the times are so hard; that here, there, why, no longer ago now than yesterday, was I obliged to pay the lord-knows-what-all away for one thing or other: and then my misfortune to day; an angel to the constables; and besides this comes the day after to morrow, when I must make up a sum for the wine-merchant: wherefore if your honour would but discharge your score in East-cheap; because, as why, your honour knows—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>How's this, dame Quickly?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Because, I say, as why, your honour knows, seventy odd pound is a great deal of money for a poor widow woman to lose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>What talk you of losing, hostess?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>True, Sir John, as you say, to be sure, I shall not be willing to lose it: for the law is open, and I know which way to get my money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>I am glad thou dost, hostess: as in that case I need not give myself the trouble to pay thee. The law is open, say'st thou? Ay, like a mouse-trap, on the catch for nibbling clients. Enter thy action, and I will hold thee a gallon of sack, thy departed husband will get out of purgatory ere thou out of the hands of thy lawyer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir John, you need not twit me upon that. You need not fling my poor husband's soul in my teeth. He has not been gone so long; tho' for the matter of that he might have been in heav'n before now, hadn't I lent you the money Mr. Dumb should have had to say masses for him. Yes, Sir John, you have put into that great belly of yours what should have got my poor husband out of purgatory, and now you reproach me for it. Had he been still alive you would not have us'd his disconsolate widow thus. You wouldn't, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>No, I'll be sworn I should not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Well then, Sir John, out of charity, if it were nothing else, you ought to repay the money. Nay, if you don't, I'll pray night and day that you may be haunted by his ghost. Heav'n rest his soul. I would he might never sleep quietly in his grave, till he has made you pay me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Go to, thou art a foolish woman: with good words thou may'st be paid.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir John, good words will not do. I must have money Sir John. The priests won't get a soul out of purgatory without money. Besides, Sir John, good words are no payment, I can get no body to take them: good words will not do with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, I say you may be paid—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>May! Sir John, I must.—You have thus shuffled off and on me, a good while; but I must, I must be paid, I must—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Heigh! heigh! wilt thou raise the neighbourhood on us? If thou art clamorous, I will have thee duck'd
<pb n="8" facs="13"/>
in the Thames, for a bawd. What, a-plague, art thou drunk? On the honour of my knighthood thou shalt be paid. Dost thou doubt mine honour?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir John, to be sure, no-body would scruple to conside in your honour's honour: but then you know Sir John (no-body better) what honour is. It will buy neither coals nor candles; nor will my landlord take it for rent, nor the merchant for sack or sherry. But would you give me only the half in money, and leave the rest to honour; so that a body might keep open house, Sir John. That would be doing something.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if thou wilt be advis'd, I will do more for thee.—Bardolph! forget not to go (when I send thee) to the cashier, with whom I left a thousand pound this morning, and tell him to satisfy Mrs. Quickly forthwith.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>A thousand pound!</p>

<p>The times are not so bad, hostess (thanks to our friend Shallow) but we may yet have a merry bout in East cheap.—How says my Dol!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>Nay, you know, sweet Jack, I was always at your pleasure there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>That I will say for her, and a sweeter-natur'd better hearted creature never lay by the side of a true man Bat, goodness heart! why do we tarry here, when Sir John complain'd of his being fatigued, and was looking for a house of civil entertainment? I will shew you the way incontinently, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I thank thee, hostess; I am now somewhat recruited, and will endeavour to reach Eastcheap. And ye a cap of sack, by the way, I think, would not be amiss</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>No indeed, Sir John, your honour spoke of fatigue; but did not descend to particles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Well then. I will tell ye now. Give me first a glass of sherris. <stage>(<hi>Drinks</hi>)</stage> You must know that, after the king (hang him for a sheep-stealing cur) gave me that rebuff I told you of; he stalk'd majestically away, and left me to the mercy of the multitude: when, as I stood parleying with mine antient; mine arms a kembo thus; a knot of elbowing carls bore me down before them, with the impetuosity of a torrent. Lo! there was I, jamm'd fast in the midst of a vile groupe of mechanics, as if we had grown together in a body corporate: and in this jeopardy was I carried along; sometimes bolster'd up on all sides, at the confluence of several turnings, like a May-pole; and at others, wire-drawn between two stone walls, as if they meant to make chitterlings of me: now this fair round beliy taking the form of a Christmas pye, and by and by press'd as slat as a pancake. It is a miracle I did not burst in the midst of them. Had it nor been for the sufficiency of my buff doublet, I should have certainly bursted.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>If you had, Sir John, you would have went off with a report like a bladder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>A bladder, ye jade, a demi-culverin at least. I should have died an hero: my exit would have made some noise in the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="18"/>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Heav'n forbid, Sir John, you should ever die a virulent death, I say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>I hope, indeed, sweet knight, you will never be press'd to death. That must be an odd end, and yet methinks I could bear much.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>I'll be sworn thou could'st, Dol: but thou art a woman, and made to bear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Yes, in good sooth, poor woman is made to bear ev'ry thing. She must suffer all a man's ill humours; let 'em lie never so heavy upon her: and, by my truly, some men are nothing else. But, to be sure, Sir John, you was most unhumanly used. Would no body take pity upon you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Pity! the most remorseless rascals! they made no more of me than if I had been a lump of dough, they were kneading to make dumplings of: and to expostulate with the villains, would have been preaching to the winds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>Why did not you exert your courage, Sir John? draw upon them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Draw, sayst thou? I could not come at my rapier, to be master of a kingdom. And as for good words, in return for the few I gave them, they let fly their jests so thick at me, and pepper'd me so plaguly with small wit, that I was dumbfounded.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>I thought you could never have been overmatch'd that way, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Yet so it was, Doll. They were holiday-wits, and came loaden with choke-pears: bur, indeed, I was overcower'd by numbers. Two to one, Doll, you know—They pelted me from all quarters. Will you hear? I wiil give you a spice of their farcasms; a sample of the gibing pellets they threw at me. As I was thus stemming the tide, and crying out for the lord's sake, a dried eel's-skin of a fishmonger ask'd me how I could complain of the croud. Is a porpoise ill at ease, said he, amidst a glut of sprats and herrings? I had not time to answer the smelt, before a barber-surgeon, the very model of the skeleton
<pb n="14" facs="19"/>
in his glass-case, offered to tap me for the dropsy; and to make us all elbow-room by letting out a puncheon of canary, at my girdle. Right, cries a third, at the word canary, I'll be hang'd if any thing be in the doublet of that fat rogue but a hog's-skin of Spanish wine; and incontinently they roar'd out, on all sides, Tap him, there,—tap him, master surgeon.—'Sblood; I was forc'd to draw in my horns, and be silent; lest the villains, being thirsty, should force the shaver to operation. The knave, indeed, was five weavers off, and so could not well come at me; I might otherwise have been drunk up alive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>And pray how cam'st thou off at last, Sir John?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>By mere providence: for, after the barbarous rascals had squeez'd the breath out of my body, they buffetted me because I could not roar out, God save the king. At length, I know not how, they threw me down in the cloisters, where, falling cross-wise and the way being narrow, I fairly block'd up the passage: upon which (for they could not straddle over me) they took, another way (a plague go with them!) for fear of losing the show. And thus was I left to take in wind, and gather myself up at leisure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>And did the mangy villains so play upon thy sack but? a parcel of sapless twigs! dry elms, fit only for fuel! I would I had the burning of them.</p>

<p>Wouldst thou fire them, Dol? Ha! art thou touch wood still, Dol?</p>

<p>Nay, Sir John, not so.</p>

<p>No, I'll be sworn, Sir John, to my carnal knowledge, if there be truth or faith in medicine. But Sir John, what would your honour please to have supper?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Another glass of sherris—fill me out, Bardol I cannot eat. I have lost my appetite by the way. Put egg into a quart of mull'd sack, and give it me when a-bed. I will to sleep.</p>

<p>I will go; but I fear my mission will prove as fruitless as that of many other Apostles, sent among Infidels. As there is no danger of martyrdom, however, I am content.—Persuade Sir John Falstaff to turn monk! could I work miracles, indeed, and, like St. Thomas, turn an Ethiop white, something might be said for it: bur, as it is, I despair of converting an old deboshee from two such prevailing heresies as the whore and the bottle.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Two found naps, of eight hours a-piece, have something recruited me. Bardolph, my morning's whet. Is it prepar'd?</p>

<sp>

<p>'Tis here Sir John.</p>

<p>Here's to our better fortune.</p>
<stage>[Drinks.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Sir John, I am afeard our fortune hath been at its highest stood. We have seen our best days.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>So the world goes Bardolph. Up and down! But is it not hard now? I that have—but that's nothing. I hate boasting. It is, however, well known what pains I have taken to make a man of that Hal. Nay, you yourself are privy to many the good offices I have done him. Before the younker knew me, he could not drink sack; made conscience of going to church on holidays; and blush'd like a scarlet cloak, at entering a bawdy-house. I instructed him in all the manly exercises. I was content to win his money, to teach him gaming: to get drunk myself to try to make him so. Nay, setting rotten limbs and dignity aside, have I not even pimp'd for the bashful rogue?
<pb n="20" facs="25"/>
Such a prince of Wales! by my troth, I was asham'd of him. Had it not been for me, the milk-sop might have been crown'd before he had lost his maiden-head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>And that would have been a pity, Sir John, to be sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>It was I first taught him to way-lay the true-man; for I knew him when he durst not cry <hi>stand</hi> to a turkey-cock; nay, a gander, of the ordinary size of a greengoose, had it met him on a common, would have made him run for it. I went farther yet; and not only embolden'd his actions, but taught him the manly arts of conversation. In the stile military, for instance, or swearing.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Sir John, I believe, there you forget yourself; the prince wanted no assistance of you in that; for when he was a little crack, he would swear ye as well as a man six foot high.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Right, Bardolph, you are right. I remember me; swearing indeed he knew: for, tho' but a king's son, he would, as thou say'st, rap out an oath like an emperor. But then for the quintessence of all elocution, the use of the hyperbole, vulgarly call'd lying; there I am a master, yet what a deal of pains it hath cost me to teach Hal to lie▪ and all thrown away upon him. He would never do it roundly. He had no genius that way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>You know, Sir John, the prince never could away with lying. He us'd to say 'twas beneath a gentleman and a soldier.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, he will never shine in the recital of his own exploits as Xenophon, Caesar, and I, have done.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir John, to be sure, you have done something.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Something! the services I have done him and his father are out of number. Methinks my behaviour, in the ever memorable action at Shrewsbury, should make him blush at his ingratitude. Who kill'd Hotspur? Did not I give him his death's wound in the thigh? Was it not I who took prisoner that fiery dragon Coleville? and that even alive! And am I thus requited? Is this the
<pb n="21" facs="26"/>
guerdon of my great atchievements? Hang valour, I'll hack my sword no more▪ Thus has it ever been the fate of merit to be rewarded. Alcibiades and Bellisarius for that!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir John, they were tall fellows: they were sadly us'd indeed: I have heard of them. But that was in king John's time, I think.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>They were the Falstaffs of antiquity, Bardolph.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Like enough, Sir John: they were before my time, to be sure; though Pistol told me, t'other day, that general Bellisarius was his god father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Pistol is an ignorant braggard; an ass: I have injur'd my dignity by associating with rascals, not worthy to wait at my heels. What tell'st thou me of Pistol?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir John, I meant no harm. I do think you deserve to be made a lord of indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>I expected nothing less, I can assure ye. And then, for my well-known oeconomy, to have had the sole management of the exchequer at least.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>And instead of that to be banish'd—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>I know not if I heard the word banish. I was forbidden indeed to come near the king's person by ten miles; but I was not at that distance when those injunctions were laid on me. Quere now (it might pose a casuist, let me tell ye) whether I am thereby injoin'd to march right out, ten miles an end; whether the negative, <hi>not come,</hi> amounts to the positive, <hi>go.</hi>—I will not understand it so; and, if that be my lord chief-justice's construction, by the Lord, I will put him to the trouble of carrying of me: I will be laid up with the gout ere I budge a foot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir John, the king did say, banish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Admit it: unless he means to reside for ever in a place, and be in his own proper person as immoveable as a church, I hold my life on a damn'd precarious tenure. He must give me timely notice of his motions, that I may regulate mine accordingly; otherwise, if he be travelling my way, we may happen to encounter, and I get myself hang'd through inadvertency. I do not think it safe, therefore, to stir out of town, without more explicit orders. Give me another draught.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="22" facs="27"/>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>The tankard is out, Sir John, Shall I replenish?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>No. I'll toward St. Paul's: a gentle perambulation this morning may refresh me.</p>

<head>SCENE V. <stage>A Street.</stage></head>
<stage>Enter Justice SHALLOW, Master SLENDER, and a LAWYER.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Well, master Pleadwell, are you still of that opinion. If so, my money's gone?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, I am still of that opinion, justice Shallow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>What! how! that my money's gone?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I know not that. I say, I am of opinion you should have taken a bond, or obligation, at the time of lending it, friend Shallow. A thousand pound on the bare word of a courtier; and that courtier Sir John Falstaff! ne'er an alderman in the city of London would have lent a thousand pence on such security.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Slen.</speaker>
<p>Oh, that ever a country 'squire should have less wit than a city alderman!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>A thousand pound, Mr. Shallow, is—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>A thousand pound. I know it is, master Pleadwell, I know it well. But pray now, is there no method in the law to recover it? He cannot have spent it yet: cannot we compel him to restitution? Arrest him—arrest him, Mr. Pleadwell.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>But, should he deny the debt, how will you prove it? and who knows, on such an emergency, what Sir John Falstaff will not do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Nay, he will lye: that's the truth on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Slen.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Coz, and that most consumedly too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>I can prove his receipt of the money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>But the conditions, justice Shallow—What have you to shew that he is engag'd to return it? and when?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Nothing: I was weak enough to lend it him on his bare word.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="23" facs="28"/>
<speaker>Slen.</speaker>
<p>Nay, cousin Shallow, not so neither. I'll be sworn he borrow'd it upon his oath. He swore upon the honour of a true knight, to give him a thousand pound again; and besides that, the comings-in of a better thing, in his majesty's court at London.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Master Slender, these knights have just honour enough to swear by; but, for any thing further, I am apprehensive we shall find him one of those honourable knights, whose word is as good as their oath. But see, if I mistake not, yonder he comes; this encounter may perhaps save us the trouble of attending him at home. Let us speak him fair, and persuade him, if possible, to sign an obligation for the money. If we can do that, we may trounce him. Let me alone with him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Slen.</speaker>
<p>O would you could, Mr. Pleadwell! what would I give methinks to see him well trounc'd! if it was only for giving me once a bloody coxcomb.</p>

<p>Ha! what mine old acquaintance Master Wheedlepoint! how is it with your health, Master Wheedlepoint?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>Pleadwell is my name, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Right.—I cry you mercy—Roundabout Pleadwell, think. My memory is not so retentive as—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="24" facs="29"/>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>No offence, Sir John, that is not the case.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Marry but it is, Mr. Pleadwell; a treacherous memory is my great defect: and a misnomer in law thou knowest—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>Would be matter of consequence, Sir John. But that is not our business at present. Mr. Shallow here hath put a case.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Master Shallow should know something of the law too. Was not he at Clement's inn when thou wert first enter'd there? That must be many years ago, Mr. Pleadwell.—Let me see. How many years ago must that be, Master Shallow?—Why you carry your age well, Mr. Pleadwell.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Pretty well, pretty well, Sir John, but that—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Nay marry, I say, very well, Master Shallow. And pray what is become of young Puzzlecause, and Dick Silvertongue, your fellow-students there? they were call'd to the bar, I suppose. That Dick was a prate-a-pace rogue? and a devil among the bona robas. He and Master Shallow here were two with the wenches. Ha, Master Shallow!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>No matter, Sir John, at present we would confer on other business.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Nay, gentlemen, if ye are on business, I crave your pardon, and leave ye. I am not used to be impertinent,</p>

<p>You are not going, Sir John; it is with you our business lies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Business with me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Yes, about the thousand pound, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>What mean you, Master Shallow?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>That you borrow'd of me, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Slen.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir John, the thousand pound you borrow'd of my cousin Shallow, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Take me with ye, gentlemen, both; let me understand ye. You presented me, indeed, with a thousand pound to promote your interest at court, Master Shallow and may depend on it, if I can serve you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="25" facs="30"/>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Fiddle, faddle, Sir John, I expect my money again: your interest at court is not worth a farthing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>I cannot help that; the more is my misfortune, Mr. Shallow; you see my heart is good.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>If so, Sir John, you will not refuse to give Mr. Shallow something to shew for his money, under your hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>How dost thou know that, Mr. Pleadwell? I must consult my counsel in this case.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>There is no need, Sir John; I will draw up a little instrument, to which thou wilt set thy hand immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Not while I have a head, Master Pleadwell, I like not running hand over head in these matters. By latter Lammas, or St. Falstaff's day, I may perhaps bethink me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>I know of no saint of thy family in the kalendar, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, there may be saints of a worse. Our merit hath not stood in the way of promotion; that's all: and yet there are as many whoremasters there as lawyers, I believe; Bun I cannot tarry now to hold farther question with thee; fatigued as I am, and earnest to reach my lodgings yonder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>If thou wilt there sign the instrument, Sir John, we will attend you thither.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou? it is a notorious bawdy-house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>No matter, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>No matter, sayst thou? Is it then no matter for one of the grave sages of the law to be seen in a public bawdy-house? Lord, Lord, what will this world come to! My conscience, however, is more tender: I should be sorry to give such occasion of scandal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>Please you, Sir John, to be serious. Let us rightly understand each other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart, good Master Pleadwell; then, to be plain with you, I find you do not know me. You talk to me of restitution and conditions; did'st thou ever know Sir John Falstaff make restitution on any conditions?
<pb n="26" facs="31"/>
And dost thou think me so unpractis'd a courtier as to return the perquisites of my calling, because I am turn'd out; or to restore the purchase of my good-will, because I am not likely to get in. What take ye me for a younker? a geck? Go to—you cannot play upon me.—Master Shallow, rest you content: your money is in good hands; and, if I do not spend it like a gentleman, never trust me with a thousand pound again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Oh! that I ever did trust such a caitiff!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>But, pray, were these the conditions, Mr. Shallow? Was you to be repaid by a place at court?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Slen.</speaker>
<p>To be sure. Why what do you think. Mr. Pleadwell, cousin Shallow was fool enough to lend a thousand pound for nothing? Why, I, myself, was to be made a great man too; and that into the bargain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Cousin Slender, speak in your turn, I pray you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>Were these terms specified?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Not indeed on parchment, <hi>signatum &amp; sigillatum,</hi> Mr. Pleadwell. A courtier's promise is not, indeed, very good in law. But I can tell ye the posts I should have procur'd for these noble 'squires: and by'r lady, thou wilt say they would have been well occupied. Having a little pique or so at my Lord-chief-justice, and Mr. Shallow, here, thinking himself qualified, I promis'd him my interest for his worship's removal from the quorum to his lordship's place on the bench. Was it not so, Mr. Shallow?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Don't belye me, Sir John, don't cheat me of my money, and laugh at me too. Robert Shallow esquire will not put up with that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Then for Mr. Slender here, I purpos'd, for his address and elocution, to have got him appointed orator to the house of parliament; or otherwise, in consideration of his figure and magnanimity, to have made him a staff officer, or captain of horse, at the least.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Slen.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir John, you did not tell me what; but I expected some notable place, I'll assure ye: for I look upon myself, plain 'squire as I stand here, to be somebody.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="27" facs="32"/>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Coz, coz, you are an ass, coz.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Slen.</speaker>
<p>Why, why, I didn't lend him the money; I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Law.</speaker>
<p>Justice Shallow, this is a very simple affair. I am sorry it is not in my power to serve you in it. Sir John, if you had either honour or honesty, you would restore the money; but, as you make pretensions to neither, I leave you.</p>

<p>Nay, rest you a moment, Dr. Caius, I would commune with you a little on the score of old acquaintance. Pray, master doctor, how came you to leave Windsor? You were, I thought, in some repute there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caius.</speaker>
<p>How Came I to leave Windsor! By gar dat Windsor did leave me.—Repute! Morbleu, I was in de best reputation du monde. In dree year, dare vas no less dan dree honderd patients of quality under my hands.—They did never complain of mal-treatment: and yet I did stay dere till I had no patients left.</p>

<p>That's much.—But did all your patients die? Say you? Not one survive to trumpet the fame of their doctor!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Caius.</speaker>
<p>Yes, by gar, derevas one Bourgeois fort riche et fort mal: he bring me more disgrace than all dose dat vas dead. I did exert all my skill for two, dree year; and he would not be cured.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Then why did you not let him go after the rest?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caius.</speaker>
<p>By gar he would not go. II a ètè fort entetè, cet homme la. I ave give him opiates, de narcotiques, stronger by gar dan Lethe itself. But he would not be composed; he would live to disgrace me. So he turn me off; and grew well himself, bientôt, presently, without any medicine in the world.</p>

<p>Right, master Caius; it is a damned thing when people will not die secundum artem; but live in spite of the doctor. But to the present concern, how is it with Peto?</p>
</sp>

<p>Sixteen ounces! Hast thou a design upon his life? What, a plague, wouldst thou kill him? He doth not weigh four pounds averdupoize, flesh, bones and all; and thou would'st take him away by quarterns, in a slop-bason.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Caius.</speaker>
<p>Vat is dat, Sir John? vill you instruct me in de patologie, de therapeutice, de indications et contra-indications? Monsieur Peto, must be bled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Bleed sick apes and hypp'd monkies. If Peto be not hang'd, he shall die a natural death. Thinkest thou I'll have his veins drained to fill a row of porringers in a barber's shop window! use bits of red cloth and be damn'd: ye shall have the blood of no follower of mine. Sixteen ounces! I tell thee, not Galen, Hippocrates, nor Esculapius himself, were they alive, should thus operate upon him. Phlebotomy! I will phlebotomize ye all with my rapier, by the Lord, if you offer to draw a lancet on him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Caius.</speaker>
<p>Eh bien done, Sir John; be not in one passion; ve vill take little less; but, by gar de patient vill die, if he no be bled. And let me tell you, Sir John, you vould do yell to lose little blood. En vcrité vous êtes crop phletorique.</p>

<head>SCENE III.</head>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Good day to you, master doctor apothecary. And yet I know not whether I ought to wish that neither; for a good day to him must be a bad one to some-body. A man of any conscience, or humanity, knows not how to salute fellows of such an occupation: for who would wish the rest of mankind lame and blind, sick and sorry, to find them employment, forsooth?—Poor Peto! I would not lose him, methinks; for, tho' he be a worthless knave, he is an old acquaintance; and I never could find in my heart to part with my old acquaintance merely because they were good for nothing. King Hal is another sort of a man to what I am, to abandon his old friends in his prosperity thus. Poor Peto!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Ecod, Sir John, it happen'd lucky for me, I can tell ye, that I came off so well as I did yesterday.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Ay, by'r lady, thou playd'st fair to get off in a whole skin, and leave thy friend and master in extremity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Nay, 'pon honour, Sir John, I did my utmost
<pb n="36" facs="41"/>
to keep up with you: but 'twas unpossible; and indeed it was very fortunable that I was not myself trod to death by the populous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Thou! tell me the moon is a Suffolk cheese, or a Windser pear. Thou! have I not seen thee clear the ring without a staff, at a bear-baiting? Thou might'st make thy way through a legion, nay the millions of a croisade: why, who would come within a fathom of that firebrand, thy nose? It is a flaming two-edged sword. Wouldst thou make me believe the villains would come near thee, to burn their holiday cloaths? Thou wouldst have set them a-blaz'ng like stubble, and have consumed the whole procession of heralds, like men of straw. A plague upon them, it was by their avoiding thee, I suppose, that I had like to have died a martyr to corpulency.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Sir John, you are always plaguing me about my face; what would you have me do with it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Do with it! If there were water enough in the Thames, I would have thee quench it. But water, I fear, can do nothing for thee; since I remember, when we rode last from Canterbury, when the rain beating full in our faces, thou cam'st into the Borough with thy nose and cheeks glowing red-hot, although they had been hissing all the way like a tailor's goose. God forgive me—but when thou runn'st behind the hedge, in fear of the officer; I could not help comparing him and thee to Moses and the burning-bush. But thou wilt in time be consumed: thy fire must out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>I would it were out, so be I might hear no more on't. In troth, Sir John, if I must always be your butt, I shall seek another service I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, good Bardolph, that must not be. I speak not in disparagement, heav'n knows: for I mean to cherish thee against the lack of fuel, or the visitation of a Dutch winter.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Give me good words then, Sir John. Why pumkin head, pray now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Hast thou never seen a scoop'd pumpion set over a candle's-end, on a gate post, to frighten ale wives from gossiping by owl-light? That is a type of thee—that is thy emblem: thy head being hollow, full of light, and easily broken; as thou shalt experience, if thou offer'st to fly thy colours till disbanded by authority. I shall need thee, I tell thee, to keep me warm under the coldness of the king's displeasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir John, burnt sack and ginger will do you more good: for whatsomever light I may give, I am fare, set aside choler, I am as cold as e'er a white-liver'd younker in town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Cold, sayst thou! thy face would condemn thee for an incendiary before any bench of judicature in the kingdom! thou wouldst carry apparent combustibles into court with thee. Tell not me of cold. Thou wouldst certainly have been hang'd long ago, had not the sheriff been afraid thou wouldst have fir'd the hangman or the gibbet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir John, I have been your attendant off and on these twenty years, come Candlemas; and I don't find I have had any such effect on you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>The cause, you rogue, the cause; am not I oblig'd to keep a pipe of Canary constantly discharging on me? Are not the tapsters perpetually employed? the sackbuckets for ever a going, to keep me from blazing? And yet at times my skin is shrivell'd up like an April pippin. Mark me but walking an hundred paces, with thee glowing at my heels, if I do not broil and drip like a roasting ox.</p>

<p>Then you must get a wife, Sir John, for your common fields, you know, never bear clover.</p>

<p>Marry! what to be made a cuckold of, I warrant ye?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Why, Sir John, if you should marry, you would not like to be singular, I suppose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal,</speaker>
<p>Nay, for the matter of that, all's one: but who will have me? Your dames of breeding are too fine and finicking tor me to bear with them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Ay, or for them to bear you either, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Nay, whoever has me, she must be no tenderling; she must be none of your gingerbread lasses, that will crumble to pieces in the towzling. She must be none of your wishy-washy, panada gentry neither; your curd and whey gentlefolks, that cannot support the embraces of a soldier, I must have a kicksy-wicksey of more substantial stuff.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir John, what say you to Madam Ursula, your old sweetheart? You have courted her to my knowledge these twenty years last past. I suppose you know her great aunt is dead, and has left her four hundred marks a year.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>No, by the lord, I heard nothing on't. She sent me a letter, indeed, into Gloucestershire; but I was over a bottle, and would not interrupt the glass to read it. I knew it was hers by the superscription, which by the way, however, was as unintelligible as the hand-writing on the wall. It had never reached me had not the bearer been a decypherer. Go, Bardolph, and fetch it; you will find it among other trumpery in my cloak bag.</p>

<p>Four hundred marks a year, quoth he! It were not an unreasonable competence were not sherries comparatively so dear. But if the female incumbrance on it should turn out a shrew; the Lord have mercy on me, in thus paying off the sins of my youth. Let me bethink me. Four hundred marks a year! I have, it is true, small hopes from Hal; and shall grow old some time or other. These aches in my limbs forebode it. I cannot hold out for ever; that's certain. Were it not good, therefore, to make a virtue of necessiry, and take up while I am in case to reap the credit of reformation?

I could have credited thee for subtlety, on account of that old friend to woman, the serpent: but how thou couldst remember for fifteen years together what money I owed thee—that indeed I cannot account for. I have myself forgot it long since. She tells me here, I have borrow'd five hundred pounds of her at times, as tokens of my love. By the Lord, and as I am a soldier, I will love her still, and she shall command semblable proofs of it. <stage>(Reads on)</stage> Hum—hum—Repayment of the money
<pb n="40" facs="45"/>
or the performance of my engagements! Hoo! am I then to be married on compulsion? That will go most damnably against the grain. But hold—if I marry, her money will be mine: if nor, she may cease to lend when she pleases: and the fortune of that man is always at the turning of the tide, who depends on the caprice of a woman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<p>Why, marry her, then, Sir John. I dare say she has heard nothing of your disgrace at court; so that she won't stand upon terms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Marry, Bardolph, and I am half resolved to do so. Yea, by the Lord, and I will too. She has besides two thousand pounds in money, I will courageously make the attack and mount the breach of matrimony. If I sall into the hands of Philistines; why, good night. It is but going into purgatory a few years before my time, Bardolph, get me pen and ink, in the cupid. Thou shalt be one of love's messengers.—I will write to her in trope and figure: metaphor and hyperbole carry all before them with the women. Let her resist lyes and nonsense if she can.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Well, my fair princess, see thy wand'ring knight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urs.</speaker>
<p>Welcome to London, Sir John; thou art indeed a wanderer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>A true knight-errant for thy sake.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urs,</speaker>
<p>For my sake, Sir John?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Ay, for thine, my Helen. Have I not encounter'd tremendous giants and fiery dragons, in the rebels of Northumberland and Wales? And then for magicians and enchanted castles: Owen Glandower and his Welch devils we put to the rout; and many a strong hold between here and West-Chester have I visited, releasing fair damsels and distressed 'squires from captivity. I brought two of the latter up to town; I would they were safely immur'd in the country again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urs.</speaker>
<p>And all these exploits for me, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>As I am a true knight, to lay my laurels at thy feet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urs.</speaker>
<p>Do you then still love me in sincerity, Sir John?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Do I love thee? Am I a soldier? Have I courage? Love thee; I will be thy Troilus, and thou shalt be my Cressida.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urs.</speaker>
<p>You have long told me so, indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>And can I lye? Thou shalt be sole possessor of my person and wealth. Thou shalt share in the honours done me at the court of the new king. Thou shalt—but what shalt thou not do? We will be married incontinently.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urs.</speaker>
<p>O, Sir John, you know your own power, and our sex's weakness: but indeed for decency I cannot so speedily consent. Besides, Sir John, I am not yet put into possession of my estate and monies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Nay then, as thou sayst, love, for decency's sake,
<pb n="44" facs="49"/>
we must bear with a short delay: but I will no longer be kept out of possession than thou art.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Urs.</speaker>
<p>You shall not, Sir John; and, in the mean time, our lawyers shall confer on the terms of our marriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>I hate lawyers. Let a priest suffice. Am not I a man of honour?</p>

<p>Not so, fair mistress. If to wed be good, the sooner married still the better sped. My assiduities will make you soon forget your former spouse.</p>

<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Quickly!—I thought your husband name was—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, and so it was; but I called him always Quickly, because he was ever so slow. He died, poor man, of a slow melancholy. Always asleep! night and day asleep!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Hah! addicted to somnolency.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Ay, so the doctors said. He died of a solemnity, and a solemn end, I warrant ye, he made of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>He was too fat and corpulent perhaps; I am leaner.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, he grew fat and burstened, by sotting with his guests, instead of minding the main chance and scoring double.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Shal.</speaker>
<p>Say you? Mistress!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>

<p>Oh, fy, Mr. Slender. You make me blush. Young maidens should not be told so, tho' it were true. But, pray, where learnt you now that I was in love with you? Who told you this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Slend.</speaker>
<p>Marry, that did my uncle Shadow's fencing master, the Don with the hard name. I should otherwise have blushed more by hals than you. Hang me if you had caught me at falling in love first. But one good turn deserves another, as we say in the country.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Peace be with you. Sir John, God save ye.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Thank thee good father. What is your reverence's will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>I think thou dost not know me, Sir John. It is indeed many years since our personal intimacy: your way of life and mine—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Were something different, father, to be sure: and tho' I may have seen you before, it is so long since I have been at shrift, that I must crave your pardon if I have totally forgot you. And yet your reverence may be ray ghostly father, for ought I know.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Fy, fy, Sir John, a man of your age and gravity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Hoh! if your business be to chide me, I shut mine cars.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>If you will not admit your wound to be prob'd; how can you expect to be cured, Sir John?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Cur'd! 'sblood, I took thee for a priest, and I find thou art a surgeon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>A spiritual one, Sir John; and such as your disorder requires.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Dost thou know my case then? A spiritual surgeon sayst thou? I am not given over by the surgeons bodily yet. Who call in the divine till they have sent out the doctor?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>I know your case well, Sir John. It is perhaps less your body than your mind that is infected.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Nay, like enough. I have indeed been damnably dispirited ever since the king's coronation. A confounded melancholy hangs upon me like a quotidian ague.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>It is that melancholy, and the cause of it, Sir John, I would remove.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>And how wouldst thou remove it? By providing
<pb n="49" facs="54"/>
me with a charge of horse, and restoring me to the king's favour. I know no other way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>By inducing thee to repent, and be restor'd to the favour of the King of kings; which thou hast forfeited by a dissolute and abandoned life. Dost thou not think thou art in a state of reprobation?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Pray, friar, by what authority dost thou take upon thee to catechise me? Dost thou come out of mere charity, or art thou employ'd by thy superiors?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Suppose the former, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Suppose the former, father friar, why then the devil is so strong in me, that I should be tempted to throw thee headlong down stairs for thy charitable impertinence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Thy ill-manners, Sir John, would be inexcusable, were it not to be supposed the consequence of an habitual antipathy to every thing that is good. But, I will not lay claim to greater merit than is my due. I am come by order of my Lord-chief-justice; who is so much your friend as to interest himself in your reformation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>My Lord-chief-justice! that's another matter. I cry thee mercy, reverend father. I find thou'rt not the man I took thee for. Your reverence does me honour; and I profess I am much indebted to his lordship's kind love and regard to my soul's health.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>You'll hear me then, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Yea, heav'n forbid I should not—what I said was meant against those officious zealots, who are so forward to pry into men's consciences that will not bear the looking into.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Sir John, we know your failings; and shall not put you to the trouble of auricular confession at present.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>There, friar, thou winn'st my heart. Come sit thee down. Wilt drink a glass of sack?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>I never do, Sir John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>I cry thee mercy, then. Here is to your reverence's health; and now, I'll tell thee what,—I do protest, I sit me now upon the stool of repentance, and have been honestly deliberating, some time past, to change my course
<pb n="50" facs="55"/>
of life. I am heartily tir'd of it. Indeed, I am, good father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>I am glad to find thee in such promising dispositions, and think thou couldst not do better than to betake thyself, agreeable to his lordship's intentions, to some monastery, where thou wilt be secluded from temptations, and have all spiritual assistance to encourage thee to mortify the desires of the flesh.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Hold thee there, good father. Let me understand thee. What! would his lordship make a monk of me? I must there beg his pardon. A monk; and to mortify the flesh! For heav'ns sake, good father, consider what a mortification indeed that must be to me, who have fix times the quantity of any other man. If I must be included within the pale of the church, why not make a canon of me (not indeed a minor canon) but a prebendary, or a bishop, now. Something might be said for either of these. But for a monk! I know not any thing I am less fit for; unless indeed his lordship had meant to make a running footman of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir John, his lordship will not use compulsion in this. He will not so far lay a restraint on your inclinations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>O, if I ever find myself that way inclin'd; his lordship may depend on it I shall be as ready as ever to follow my inclinations. But the lesson of lean and sallow abstinence is very long and hard, good father; I am not gotten half-way through the first chapter yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Some steps, however, Sir John, you must take, toward a more reputable way of life; and that speedily too: otherwise you will be stript of the honours of knighthood; and the king's sentence of banishment will be strictly put into execution against you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>As to the matter of knighthood; once a knight and always a knight, you know. The king may make as many knights as he pleases; but he will not so easily unmake them again. My title will not depend on the king's courtesy, but on that of my followers. I am, notwithstanding, very desirous to give his lordship satisfaction:
<pb n="51" facs="56"/>
and do assure thee, on the honour of a soldier, of the sincerity of my repentance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>And yet this may be only a transitory fit of penitence, owing to your late disappointment. What reason canst thou give me to hope this state of mind will continue?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Why, father, what I am shortly going to do is an act, that has confin'd many a man to a state of repentance, which hath continued to the last hour of his life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>This, Sir John, is saying something. Pray what are you going to do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>I have taken a resolution, father, to—What dost thou think now it is I have resolv'd upon?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Some commendable act of penance, no doubt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Nay, it may well be call'd so, I believe. I am determin'd, good father, to marry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Call you that an act of penance, Sir John? Is marriage a state of mortification?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>I wish I may not find it so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir John, marriage is a holy state; and in some degree I approve your resolution; but, in the estimation of the church, it is also an holy act, and ought not to be enter'd into unadvisedly. Your repentance should precede your receiving the benefit of that sacrament.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>O, doubt not but I shall repent me sufficiently afterwards.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Ah! Sir John, Sir John, I fear me you are no true penitent: but, however, it may be lawful to salve what cannot be effectually cur'd. I did not expect to make a convert at the first interview. If thou takest any measures that tend toward reformation, thou shalt have my prayers and best assistance therein. Another time I will hold farther conversation with thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>In the mean time, good father, let me stand fair in your report to my Lord-chief-justice and his majesty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fr.</speaker>
<p>Thou shalt stand fairer than I fear thou deservest. Farewel.</p>

<p>Not unlikely. But, believe me, the more you bustle in this business, the more you will expose yourself. The more you stir—you know the proverb, master Shallow, it is a little homely, so let that pass. Yet, let me advise thee; rest content.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>A challenge!—By the Lord, and it is a challenge. I am call'd upon here to meet him on Tower hill incontinently at single rapier. Hoo! what a turluru! In the name of common-sense is the fool turn'd madman? What means the simple tony by this? To get his money again? Does he think by running me thro' the pericardium to become my heir at law? The fearful stag is at bay, and become desperate. But let me see—what's to be done here? I am in person too much of a knight to engage with so little a 'squire.—I have it.—Bardolph, I being your master and a knight, thou art by the laws of chivalry no less than

<p>I, Sir John. He has no quarrel against me. The challenge is given to your honour.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Lay down my target, sayst thou? Who would be fool then? Look ye, master Shallow (since shallow thou wilt be) if I fight, it must be on equal terms. It is but equitable that my body should be secur'd, when I engage with an unsubstantial form; a thing that has none. Dost thou think me such a goose cap as to lay open this fair round belly to the point of thy rapier, when thou presentest not a mark for me. It were as good as pricking at a lottery, ten thousand blanks to a prize, to make a thrust at thee. It were indeed more than a miracle to hit what, rhetorically speaking, is impalpable. But come, if thou must fight with me, thou shalt not say I deal unfairly by thee. To draw my sword would be needless: for hit thee I never shall.—That's siat. Therefore Toledo rest thou in thy scabbard. This is my ward. <stage>(<hi>Stands on his desence with his target.</hi>)</stage> Carry thy point as thou wilt: if thou canst not come into me before thou art weary, the money is mine; if thou dost, and woundest: me, I will then—keep it to pay the surgeon.

<p>You, Sir John, can answer for me.</p>

<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>How now, you bare-fac'd strumpets! what do you mean? This is no brothel: play no gambols here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Marry come up, Sir John; you will not hinder my going to my husband. Mr. Shallow will protect me; my dear Mr. Shallow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>No, nor me neither, were he twenty Sir John Falstaffs. Sweet Mr: Slender.</p>

<p>Goody Quickly, loose your hold I pray you; I know you, Mrs. Quickly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Slen.</speaker>
<p>Ay, and I know you. too, Mrs. Dorothy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>O ho! do you so? What, Sir John hath blown us; hath he? But no matter; he cannot unmarry us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>No, truly, that he can't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Nor would I: for since whores and rogues have conforted, I have never seen four better matched.</p>
</sp>

<p>I to wise Justice Shallow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Not so, hostess; keep your distance, I pray you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Slen.</speaker>
<p>No, no, keep off, Dol, keep off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>Plain Dol! do you hear that Mrs. Slender?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>And hostess, truly! do you take that Mrs. Shallow?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Away—ye termagant jades: or I will demolish your frippery.—There are your cuckolds. Pistol, Nym, why stand ye there like mutes? Are you fascinated at the success of your mummery? Or are you ruminating on the comforts of cuckoldom by anticipation.—Take hence your crooked ribs.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Pistol <hi>and</hi> Nym <hi>go and take</hi> Quickly <hi>and</hi> Dol <hi>by the hand.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Quick.</speaker>
<p>What, has there been a trick, then, played on us in these disguises? Was I married to you, Pistol?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pistol.</speaker>
<p>Dame Quickly, thou art mine. The fates have cross'd us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I'll be sworn they have joined you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>And was I married to you, Nym?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nym.</speaker>
<p>Even so, Dol. I am heartily sorry for it; but luck hath turn'd tail upon us, that's the trick on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dol.</speaker>
<p>A very scurvy trick, indeed, but I had so many
<pb n="68" facs="73"/>
husbands before, that one more or less breaks no squares with Dol. Come, Mrs. Quickly, be of good chear: Pistol is better than nobody: he will protect thee, by outswaggering the swaggerers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pistol.</speaker>
<l>Contented I, since so the fates decree,</l>
<l>Soldier no more, a victualler I'll be;</l>
<l>The martial sword exchange for carving knife,</l>
<l>And cut out viands for the means of life.</l>
<l>No more in anger fight, but joyous dine,</l>
<l>And 'stead of drawing blood, draw sparkling wine;</l>
<l>Nay, should Sir John himself my service lack,</l>
<l>At the boar's head, he'll find a glass of sack.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>But wilt thou put no lime in it, Pistol?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pistol,</speaker>
<p>No, by Falernian Bacchus, for my knight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<p>Then will I be thy guest. Nay, by'r Lady, thou shalt for once, be mine too. I will not break off the thread of our quondam familiarity with so little grace as Majesty hath done. I do invite ye all, therefore, to supper with me. And if you cannot laugh over the success of your own contrivances, be merry on the consummation of my nuptials.</p>
<l>Come, spouse, tho' long indeed hath been our courting,</l>
<l>We're not quite past the days of love and sporting;</l>
<l>'Tis true, a younger bridegroom had you sped,</l>
<l>He might have been less prone to sleep in bed;</l>
<l>Yet, ev'n in autumn, some spring flowers may grow,</l>
<l>As there are lillies in September blow:</l>
<l>Youth's wild oats sown, 'tis ne'er too late to mend;</l>
<l>The worst once past, the better is the end.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. PRITCHARD.</byline>
<stage>Enters reading a Card.</stage>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>THE muse of Shakespeare's compliments!—A card</l>
<l>T'excuse this evening's enterprizing Bard!</l>
<l>Great his presumption, to confess the truth:</l>
<l>But, as he pleads the passion of his youth,</l>
<l>Together with the magick of her charms,</l>
<l>Attracting him resistless to her arms;</l>
<l>Tho' somewhat by surprize, she owns, she suffer'd,</l>
<l>Yet, as no actual violence was offer'd,</l>
<l>She's willing, if the audience should agree,</l>
<l>For this one time to set th'offender free.</l>
<l>We women soon forgive, if not forget,</l>
<l>The crimes our beauties make the men commit,</l>
<l>Especially when once we're past our prime,</l>
<l>And Shakespeare's muse, like me,'s the worse for time.</l>
<l>For, tho' she charm with fancy ever young,</l>
<l>Tho' heav'nly musick dwell upon her tongue,</l>
<l>Lost many an artless smile and dimple sleek,</l>
<l>Which sat alluring on her virgin cheek;</l>
<l>Beauties, that faded on the gazer's eye,</l>
<l>And no cold-cream of comment can supply.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>As for what Merc'ry in the Prologue told ye;</l>
<l>Pray, let not that from clemency with-hold ye.</l>
<l>That Hermes was of old a lying blade,</l>
<l>And practic'd in imposture, as his trade;</l>
<l>The patron he, or classic lore deceives,</l>
<l>Of cheats, forestallers, higglers, hucksters, thieves.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Besides,—to tell you a stage-trick of ours—</l>
<l>But you'll not spread the secret out of doors,—</l>
<l>The man was no more Mercury, than I am</l>
<l>Queen Hecuba, the wife of Trojan Priam.</l>
<l>A messenger from Phoebus! He a god!</l>
<l>I can assure you all, 'twas Mr. Dodd;</l>
<l>His dropping from the clouds, was all a sham;</l>
<l>And his pretended errand but a flam.</l>
<l>We've heathen gods of paste-board, made to fly</l>
<l>On hempen cords across the painted sky;</l>
<l><pb facs="75"/>Those canvass clouds, that dangle there above,</l>
<l>Inveloping the throne itself of love!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>His tale fictitious too, tho' told so glib;</l>
<l>For take it on my word, 'twas all a fib.</l>
<l>Old Falstaff in Elysium!—To my thinking,</l>
<l>So great his natural tendency to sinking,</l>
<l>That to the shades if he had once descended,</l>
<l>To bring him back, not Atlas had pretended.</l>
<l>Dramatic sprites (at least they tell me so)</l>
<l>Dwell not with saints above, nor devils below:</l>
<l>But, form'd th' imagination to engage,</l>
<l>During their short-liv'd passage o'er the stage,</l>
<l>As mere ideal characters exist,</l>
<l>And stand as cyphers mark'd on Nature's list;</l>
<l>To genius giv'n a delegated power</l>
<l>To form these transient beings of an hour,</l>
<l>Which, from this mimic world whene'er they go,</l>
<l>Are free to range in fancy's pimlico,</l>
<l>A limbo large and broad; which in the schools</l>
<l>Is call'd by some the Paradise of Fools.</l>
<l><hi>Feroe naturoe</hi> THERE, their preservation</l>
<l>Is purchas'd by no game association:</l>
<l>The poaching plagiary alone denied</l>
<l>A priviege, granted to each bard beside;</l>
<l>Who, tho' a cottager, to try his skill,</l>
<l>May shoot, or course, or hunt them down at will;</l>
<l>In his own paddock may the strays receive,</l>
<l>And scorn to ask a lordly owner's leave.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Not but that <hi>bere,</hi> the Author of the play,</l>
<l>By me begs leave submissively to say,</l>
<l>"None more than he reveres great Shakespear's name,</l>
<l>"Or glows with zeal to vindicate his same."</l>
