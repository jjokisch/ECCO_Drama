<stage><hi>CHARON</hi> and <hi>AESOP</hi> discover'd.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CHARON.</speaker>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>RITHEE, Philosopher, what
grand Affair is transacting upon
Earth? There is something of Importance
going forward I am sure;
for <hi>Mercury</hi> flew over the <hi>Styx</hi> this Morning,
without paying me the usual Compliments.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell thee, <hi>Charon</hi>; this is the
Anniversary of the Rape of <hi>Proserpine</hi>; on
which Day for the future, <hi>Pluto</hi> has permitted
her to demand from him something
for the Benefit of Mankind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Char.</speaker>
<p>I understand you;—his Majesty's
Passions, by a long Possession of the Lady,
are abated; and so, like a mere Mortal, he
must now flatter her Vanity, and sacrifice his
Power, to attone for Deficiencies—But what
has our Royal Mistress proposed in behalf of
her favourite Mortals?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>As Mankind, you know, are ever
complaining of their Cares, and dissatisfied
with their Conditions, the generous <hi>Proserpine</hi>
has begg'd of <hi>Pluto,</hi> that they may
have free Access to the Waters of <hi>Lethe,</hi> as
a sovereign Remedy for their Complaints—
Notice has been already given above, and
Proclamation made: <hi>Mercury</hi> is to conduct
them to the <hi>Styx,</hi> you are to ferry 'em over
to <hi>Elysium,</hi> and I am placed here to distribute
the Waters.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Char.</speaker>
<p>A very pretty Employment, I shall
have of it, truly! If her Majesty has often
these Whims; I must petition the
Court either to build a Bridge over the
River, or let me resign my Employment.
Do their Majesties know the Difference of
Weight between Souls and Bodies? However,
I'll obey their Commands to the best
of my Power; I'll row my crazy Boat over
and meet 'em; but many of them will be
relieved from their Cares before they reach
<hi>Lethe.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>How so, <hi>Charon?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
<speaker>Char.</speaker>
<p>Why, I shall leave half of 'em in the
<hi>Styx</hi>; and any Water is a Specifick against
Care, provided it be taken in Quantity.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Mercury.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<p>Away to your Boat, <hi>Charon</hi>; there
are some Mortals arriv'd; and the Females
among 'em will be very clamorous, if you
make 'em wait.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<p>I'll make what Haste I can, rather
than give those fair Creatures a Topick for
Conversation.</p>
<stage>Noise within. Boat, Boat, Boat!</stage>
<p>Coming—coming—Zounds, you are in a
plaguy Hurry, sure!—No wonder these mortal
Folks have so many Complaints, when
there's no Patience among 'em; if they were
dead now, and to be settled here for ever, they'd
be damn'd before they'd make such a Rout
to come over,—but Care I suppose is thirsty,
and 'till they have drench'd themselves with
<hi>Lethe,</hi> there will be no Quiet among 'em;
therefore I'll e'en to work; and so Friend
<hi>Aesop,</hi> and Brother <hi>Mercury,</hi> good bye to 'ye. <stage>[Exit <hi>Charon.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Now to my Office of Judge and
Examiner, in which, to the best of my Knowledge,
I will act with Impartiality; for I
will immediately relieve real Objects, and
only divert myself with Pretenders.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<p>Act as your Wisdom directs, and
conformable to your earthly Character, and
we shall have few Murmurers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I still retain my former Sentiments,
never to refuse Advice or Charity to those
that want either; Flattery and Rudeness
should be equally avoided; Folly and Vice
should never be spared; and tho' by acting
thus, you may offend many, yet you will
please the better few; and the Approbation
of one virtuous Mind, is more valuable than
all the noisy Applause, and uncertain Favours,
of the Great and Guilty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<p>Incomparable <hi>Aesop!</hi> both Men and
Gods admire thee! We must now prepare to
receive these Mortals; and lest the Solemnity
of the Place shou'd strike 'em with too
much Dread, I'll raise Musick shall dispel
their Fears, and embolden them to approach.</p>
<lg type="song">

<l>Ye Mortals whom Fancies and Troubles perplex,</l>

Rest;</l>

</sp>
<stage><pb n="6" facs="9"/>
Enter <hi>Poet.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>Sir, your humble Servant—your
humble Servant—your Name is <hi>Aesop</hi>—I
know your Person intimately, tho' I never
saw you before; and am well acquainted
with you, tho' I never had the Honour of
your Conversation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>You are a Dealer in Paradoxes,
Friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>I am a Dealer in all Parts of Speech,
and in all the Figures of Rhetorick—I am a
Poet, Sir—and to be a Poet, and not acquainted
with the great <hi>Aesop,</hi> is a greater
Paradox than—I honour you extremely, Sir;
you certainly, of all the Writers of Antiquity,
had the greatest, the sublimest Genius, the—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Hold, Friend, I hate Flattery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>My own Taste exactly;—I assure you,
Sir, no Man loves Flattery less than myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>So it appears, Sir, by your being
so ready to give it away.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>You have hit it, Mr. <hi>Aesop,</hi> you have
hit it—I have given it away, indeed—I did
not receive one Farthing for my last Dedication,
and yet would you believe it?—I
absolutely gave all the Virtues in Heav'n, to
one of the lowest Reptiles upon Earth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>'Tis hard, indeed, to do dirty Work
for nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir, to do dirty Work, and still
be dirty oneself, is the Stone of <hi>Sysiphus,</hi> and
the Thirst of <hi>Tantalus</hi>—You <hi>Greek</hi> Writers,
indeed, carried your Point by Truth and Simplicity,—
they won't do now a-days—our
Patrons must be tickled into Generosity—you
gain'd the greatest Favours, by shewing your
own Merits, we can only gain the smallest,
by publishing those of other People.—You
flourish'd by Truth, we starve by Fiction;
<hi>Tempora mutantur.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Friend, if we may guess
by your present Plight, you have prostituted
your Talents to very little Purpose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>To very little, upon my word—but
they shall find that I can open another Vein
—Satire is the Fashion, and Satire they shall
have—let 'em look to it, I can be sharp as
well as sweet—I can scourge as well as tickle,
I can bite as—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>You can do any thing, no doubt;
but to the Business of this Visit, for I expect
a great deal of Company—What are
your Troubles, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>Why, Mr. <hi>Aesop,</hi> I am troubled with
an odd kind of a Disorder—I have a sort of
a Whistling—a Singing—a Whizzing as
it were in my Head, which I cannot get
rid of—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Our Waters give no Relief to bodily
Disorders, they only affect the Memory.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>From whence all my Disorder proceeds—
I'll tell you my Case, Sir—
You must know, I wrote a Play some time
ago, presented a Dedication of it to a certain
young Nobleman—He approv'd and accepted
of it, but before I could taste his
Bounty, my Piece was unfortunately damn'd:
—I lost my Benefit, nor could I have Recourse
to my Patron, for I was told that his
Lordship play'd the best Catcall the first
Night, and was the merriest Person in the
whole Audience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Pray, what do you call damning a
Play?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>You cannot possibly be ignorant,
what it is to be damn'd, Mr. <hi>Aesop?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Indeed I am, Sir—We had no
such thing among the <hi>Greeks.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir!—No Wonder then that
you <hi>Greeks</hi> were such fine Writers—It is
impossible to be describ'd, or truly felt, but
by the Author himself—If you could but
get a Leave of Absence from this World for
a few Hours, you might perhaps have an
Opportunity of seeing it yourself—There is
a Sort of a new Piece comes upon our Stage
this very Night, and I am pretty sure it will
meet with its Deserts; at least it shall not
want my helping Hand, rather than you
should be disappointed of satisfying your
Curiosity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>You are very obliging, Sir;—but to
your own Misfortunes, if you please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>Envy, Malice and Party destroy'd
me—You
must know, Sir, I was a great
Damner myself, before I was damn'd—So
the Frolicks of my Youth were return'd to me
with double Interest, from my Brother Authors—But,
to say the Truth, my Performance
was terribly handled, before it appear'd
in publick.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>How so, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>Why Sir, some squeamish Friends
of mine prun'd it of all the Bawdy and Immorality,
the Actors did not speak a Line of
the Sense or Sentiment, and the Manager
(who writes himself) struck out all the
Wit and Humour, in order to lower my
Performance to a Level with his own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Now, Sir, I am acquainted with
your Case, what have you to propose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>Notwithstanding the Success of my
first Play, I am strongly persuaded that my
next may defy the Severity of Criticks, the
Sneer of Wits, and the Malice of Authors.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>What! have you been hardy enough
to attempt another?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>I must eat, Sir—I must live—but
when I sit down to write, and am glowing
with the Heat of my Imagination, then—this
damn'd Whistling—or Whizzing in my
Head, that I told you of, so disorders me,
that I grow giddy—In short, Sir, I am
<pb n="10" facs="13"/>
haunted, as it were, with the Ghost of my
deceas'd Play, and its dying Groans, are for
ever in my Ears—Now, Sir, if you will
give me but a Draught of <hi>Lethe,</hi> to forget
this unfortunate Performance, it will be of
more real Service to me, than all the Waters
of <hi>Helicon.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I doubt, Friend, you cannot possibly
write better, by merely forgetting that
you have written before; besides, if, when
you drink to the Forgetfulness of your own
Works, you should unluckily forget those of
other People too, your next Piece will certainly
be the worse for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>You are certainly in the right—
What then would you advise me to?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Suppose you could prevail upon the
Audience to drink the Water; their forgetting
your former Work, might be of no small Advantage
to your future Productions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Sir! if I could but do that—
but I am afraid—<hi>Lethe</hi> will never go down
with the Audience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Well, since you are bent upon it, I
shall indulge you—If you please to walk in
that Grove, (which will afford you many
Subjects for your poetical Contemplation) till
I have examin'd the rest, I will dismiss you
in your Turn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<p>And I in return, Sir, will let the
World know, in a Preface to my next Piece,
that your Politeness is equal to your Sagacity,
<pb n="11" facs="14"/>
and that you are as much the fine Gentleman
as the Philosopher. <stage>[Exit <hi>Poet.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Oh! your Servant, Sir—In the
Name of Misery and Mortality, what have
we here!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter an <hi>Old Man,</hi> supported by a <hi>Servant.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>Oh la! oh! bless me, I shall
never recover the Fatigue—Ha! what are
you Friend? Are you the famous <hi>Aesop?</hi>
And are you so kind, so very good to give
People the Waters of Forgetfulness for nothing?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I am that Person, Sir; but you
seem to have no need of my Waters; for
you must have already out-liv'd your Memory.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>My Memory is indeed impair'd,
it is not so good as it was; but still it is better
than I wish it, at least in regard to one
Circumstance; there is one Thing which
sits very heavy at my Heart, and which I
would willingly forget.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>What is it, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>Oh la!—oh!—I am horribly
fatigued—I am an old Man, Sir, turn'd of
Ninety—We are all mortal, you know, so
I would fain forget, if you please—that I am
to die.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>My good Friend, you have mistaken
the Virtue of the Waters: They can cause
<pb n="12" facs="19"/>
you to forget only what is past; but if this
was in their Power, you would surely be
your own Enemy, in desiring to forget what
ought to be the only Comfort of one, so poor
and wretched as you seem. What! I suppose
now, you have left some dear loving Wife
behind, that you can't bear to think of parting
with.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>No, no, no; I have buried my
Wife, and forgot her long ago.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>What, you have Children then,
whom you are unwilling to leave behind
you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>No, no; I have no Children at
present—hugh—I don't know what I may
have.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Is there any Relation or Friend, the
Loss of whom—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>No, no; I have out-lived all my
Relations; and as for Friends—I have none
to lose—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>What can be the Reason then, that
in all this apparent Misery you are so afraid
of Death, which would be your only Cure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>—Oh, Lord!—I have one
Friend, and a true Friend indeed, the only
Friend in whom a wise Man places any Confidence—I
have—Get a little farther
off, <hi>John</hi>— <stage>[Servant retires.]</stage>
I have, to say the Truth, a little Money—
it is that indeed, which causes all my Uneasiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="20"/>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Thou never spok'st a truer Word
in thy Life, old Gentleman— <stage>[Aside.]</stage>
But I can cure you of your Uneasiness immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>Shall I forget then that I am to
die, and leave my Money behind me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>No—but you shall forget that you
have it—which will do altogether as well—
One large Draught of <hi>Lethe,</hi> to the Forgetfulness
of your Money, will restore you to
perfect Ease of Mind; and as for your bodily
Pains, no Waters can relieve them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>What does he say, <hi>John</hi>—eh?
—I am hard of Hearing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>He advises your Worship to drink to
forget your Money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>What!—what!—will his
Drink get me Money, does he say?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, the Waters are of a wholsomer
Nature—for they'll teach you to forget
your Money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>Will they so?—Come, come,
<hi>John,</hi> we are got to the wrong Place—
The pool old Fool here does not know what
he says—Let us go back again, <hi>John</hi>—
I'll drink none of your Waters, not I—
Forget my Money! Come along, <hi>John.</hi></p>
<stage>[Exeunt.</stage>

<p>Was there ever such a Wretch! If
these are the Cares of Mortals, the Waters

cost nothing—so I don't care if I drink a little
of your Waters—Let me see—ay—I'll
drink to forget how I <hi>got</hi> my Money—
And my Servant there, he shall drink a little,
to forget that I have any Money at all—and,
d'ye hear, <hi>John</hi>—take a hearty Draught. If
my Money must be forgot, why e'en let <hi>him</hi>
forget it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Well, Friend, it shall be as you
would have it—You'll find a Seat in that
Grove yonder, where you may rest yourself
till the Waters are distributed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old Man.</speaker>
<p>I hope it won't be long, Sir, for
Thieves are busy now—and I have an Iron
Chest in the other World, that I should be
sorry any one peep'd into but myself—
So pray be quick, Sir.</p>
<stage>[Exeunt.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Patience, Patience, old Gentleman.
—But here comes something tripping this
Way, that seems to be neither Man nor Woman,
and yet an odd Mixture of both.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter a <hi>Fine</hi> Gentleman.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>Harkee, old Friend, do you
stand Drawer here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="22"/>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Drawer, young Fop! Do you know
where you are, and who you talk to?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>Not I, dem me! But 'tis a
Rule with me, wherever I am, or whoever
I am with, to be always easy and familiar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Then let me advise you, young
Gentleman, to drink the Waters, and forget
that Ease and Familiarity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>Why so, Daddy? wou'd you
not have me well bred?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Yes; but you may not always meet
with People so polite as yourself, or so passive
as I am; and if what you call Breeding,
shou'd be constru'd Impertinence, you may
have a Return of Familiarity, may make
you repent your Education as long as you
live.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>Well said, old Dry-beard, egad
you have a Smattering of an odd kind of a
sort of a Humour; but come, come, prithee
give me a Glass of your Waters, and keep
your Advice to yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I must first be informed, Sir, for
what Purpose you drink 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>You must know, Philosopher,
I want to forget two Qualities—My <hi>Modesty,</hi>
and my <hi>Good-nature.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Your Modesty and Good-nature!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir—I have such a consummate
<hi>Modesty,</hi> that when a fine Woman
(which is often the Case) yields to my Addresses,
egad I run away from her; and I am
<pb n="16" facs="23"/>
so very <hi>good-natured,</hi> that when a Man affronts
me, egad I run away too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>As for your Modesty, Sir, I am
afraid you are come to the wrong Waters;—
and if you will take a large Cup to the Forgetfulness
of your Fears, your Good-nature, I
believe, will trouble you no more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>And this is your Advice, my
Dear, eh?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>My Advice, Sir, would go a great
deal farther—I should advise you to drink to
the Forgetfulness of every thing you know.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>The Devil you would; then
I should have travell'd to a fine Purpose
truly; you don't imagine, perhaps, that I
have been three Years abroad, and have made
the Tour of <hi>Europe?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Yes Sir, I guess'd you had travell'd
by your Dress and Conversation: But, pray,
(with Submission) what valuable Improvements
have you made in these Travels?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I learnt Drinking in <hi>Germany,</hi>
Musick and Painting in <hi>Italy,</hi> Dancing,
Gaming, and some other Amusements, at
<hi>Paris</hi>; and in <hi>Holland</hi>—faith, nothing at all;
I brought over with me the best Collection
of <hi>Venetian</hi> Ballads, two Eunuchs, a <hi>French</hi>
Dancer, and a Monkey, with Tooth-picks,
Pictures and Burlettas—In short, I have skim'd
the Cream of every Nation, and have the
Consolation to declare, I never was in any
<pb n="17" facs="24"/>
Country in my Life, but I had Taste enough
thoroughly to despise my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Your Country is greatly obliged to
you,—but if you are settled in it now, how
can your Taste and Delicacy endure it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>Faith my Existence is merely
supported by Amusements; I dress, visit,
study Taste, and write Sonnets; by Birth,
Travel, Education, and natural Abilities, I
am entitled to lead the Fashion; I am principal
Connoisseur at all Auctions, chief Arbiter
at Assemblies, profess'd Critick at the
Theatres, and a fine Gentleman—every
where—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Critick, Sir, pray what's that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>The Delight of the Ingenious,
the Terror of Poets, the Scourge of Players,
and the Aversion of the Vulgar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, (for I fancy your Life
must be somewhat particular) how do you
pass your Time; the Day, for Instance?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>I lie in Bed all Day, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>How do you spend your Evenings
then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>I dress in the Evening, and go
generally behind the Scenes of both Playhouses;
not, you may imagine to be diverted
with the Play, but to intrigue, and shew myself—I
stand upon the Stage, talk loud,
and stare about—which confounds the Actors,
and disturbs the Audience; upon which the
<pb n="18" facs="25"/>
Galleries, who hate the Appearance of one
of us, begin to <hi>hiss,</hi> and cry <hi>off, off,</hi> while I
undaunted, stamp my Foot so—loll with my
Shoulder thus—take Snuff with my Right-hand,
and smile scornfully—thus—This
exasperates the Savages, and they attack us
with Vollies of suck'd Oranges, and half
eaten Pippins—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>And you retire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>Without doubt, if I am sober
—for Orange will stain Silk, and an Apple
may disfigure a Feature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I am afraid, Sir, for all this, that
you are oblig'd to your own Imagination, for
more than three Fourths of your Importance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>Damn the old Prig, I'll bully
him— <stage>[Aside.]</stage> Lookee, old Philosopher,
I find you have pass'd your Time so
long in Gloom and Ignorance below here,
that our Notions above Stairs are too refined
for you; so as we are not likely to agree, I
shall cut Matters very short with you—Bottle
me off the Waters I want, or you shall
be convinc'd that I have Courage, in the
drawing of a Cork;—dispatch me instantly,
or I shall make bold to throw you into the
River, and help myself—What say you to
that now? eh?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Very civil and concise! I have no
great Inclination to put your Manhood to
the Trial; so if you will be pleas'd to walk
in the Grove there, 'till I have examined
<pb n="19" facs="26"/>
some I see coming, we'll compromise the
Affair between us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fine Gent.</speaker>
<p>Yours as you behave,—au Revoir!<stage>[Exit <hi>Beau.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Tatoo.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tatoo.</speaker>
<p>Why don't you come along,
Mr. <hi>Tatoo?</hi> what the deuce are you afraid
of?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Don't be angry, young Lady; the
Gentleman is your Husband, I suppose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>How do you know that, eh?
What, you an't all Conjurers in this World,
are you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Your Behaviour to him is a sufficient
Proof of his Condition, without the Gift
of Conjuration.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>Why, I was as free with him
before Marriage, as I am now; I never was
coy or prudish in my Life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I believe you, Madam; pray how
long have you been married? you seem to be
very young, Lady?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>I am old enough for a Husband,
and have been married long enough to be
tired of one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>How long, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>Why, above three Months; I
married Mr. <hi>Tatoo</hi> without my Guardians
Consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20" facs="27"/>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>If you married him with your own
Consent, I think you might continue your
Affections a little longer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>What signifies what you think,
if I don't think so?—We are quite tired of
one another, and are come to drink some of
your Le—Lethaly—Leithily, I think they
call it, to forget one another, and be unmarried
again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>The Waters can't divorce you, Madam;
and you may easily forget him, without
the Assistance of <hi>Lethe.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>Ay; how so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>By remembering continually he is
your Husband, there are several Ladies have
no other Receipt—But what does the Gentleman
say to this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>What signifies what he says? I
an't so young and so foolish as that comes
to, to be directed by my Husband, or to care
what either he says, or you say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Tat.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I was a Drummer in a Marching
Regiment, when I ran away with that
young Lady—I immediately bought out of
the Corps, and thought myself made for
ever; little imagining that a poor vain Fellow
was purchasing Fortune, at the Expence of
his Happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>'Tis even so, Friend; Fortune and
Felicity are as often at Variance as Man and
Wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="21" facs="28"/>
<speaker>Mr. Tat.</speaker>
<p>I found it so, Sir—This high
Life (as I thought it) did not agree with
me; I have not laugh'd, and scarcely slept
since my Advancement, and unless your Wisdom
can alter her Notions, I must e'en quit
the Blessings of a fine Lady and her Portion,
and for Content, have Recourse to Eight-pence
a Day, and my Drum again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Pray who has advis'd you to a Separation?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>Several young Ladies of my Acquaintance,
who tell me they are not angry
at me for marrying him, but being fond of
him now I have married him; and they say
I should be as compleat a fine Lady as any
of 'em, if I would but procure a <hi>separate
Divorcement.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Madam, will you let me know
what you call a fine Lady?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>Why, a fine Lady, and a fine
Gentleman, are two of the finest Things
upon Earth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I have just now had the Honour
of knowing what a fine Gentleman is; so
pray confine yourself to the Lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>A fine Lady before Marriage,
lives with her Papa and Mama, who breed
her up till she learns to despise 'em, and resolves
to do nothing they bid her; this makes
her such a prodigious Favourite, that she
wants for nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="22" facs="29"/>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>So, Lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>When once she is her own Mistress,
then comes the Pleasure!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Pray let us hear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>She lies in Bed all Morning,
rattles about all Day, and sits up all Night;
she goes every where, and sees every thing;
knows every body, and loves no body; ridicules
her Friends, coquets with her Lovers,
sets 'em together by the Ears, tells Fibs,
makes Mischief, buys China, cheats at Cards,
keeps a Pug-dog, and hates the Parsons; she
laughs much, talks aloud, never blushes, says
what she will, does what she will, goes where
she will, marries whom she pleases, hates
her Husband in a Month, breaks his Heart
in four, becomes a Widow, slips from her
Gallants, and begins the World again—
There's a Life for you? What do you think
of a fine Lady now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>As I expected—you are very young
Lady! and if you are not very careful, your
natural Propensity to Noise and Affectation,
will run you headlong into Folly, Extravavagance,
and Repentance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>What would you have me do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Drink a large Quantity of <hi>Lethe</hi> to
the Loss of your Acquaintance; and do you,
Sir, drink another to forget this false Step of
your Wife; for whilst you remember her
Folly, you can never thoroughly regard her,
and whilst you keep good Company, Lady,
<pb n="23" facs="30"/>
as you call it, and follow their Example, you
can never have a just Regard for your Husband;
so both drink and be happy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>Well, give it me whilst I am
in Humour, or I shall certainly change my
Mind again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Be patient, till the rest of the Company
drink, and divert yourself, in the mean
time, with walking in the Grove.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Tat.</speaker>
<p>Well, come along, Husband,
and keep me in Humour, or I shall beat you
such an Alarum as you never beat in all your
Life.</p>

<p>I hate the Wise; but who are
you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I am <hi>Aesop,</hi> Madam, honour'd this
Day by <hi>Proserpine</hi> with the Distribution of
the Waters of <hi>Lethe</hi>; command me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>Shew me to the Pump Room
then, Fellow—where's the Company—I
die in Solitude.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>What Company?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>The best Company, People of
Fashion! the <hi>Beau Monde!</hi> shew me to none
of your gloomy Souls, who wander about in
your Groves and Streams—shew me to glittering
Balls, enchanting Masquerades, ravishing
Operas, and all the polite Enjoyments of
<hi>Elysian.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>This is a Language unknown to
me, Lady—No such fine Doings here, and
very little good Company (as you call it) in
<hi>Elysium</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>What! no Operas! eh! no
<hi>Elysian</hi> then! <stage>[<hi>Sings fantastically in</hi> Italian.]</stage>
<hi>'Sfortunato Monticelli!</hi> banish'd <hi>Elysian,</hi> as
<pb n="29" facs="36"/>
well as the <hi>Hay-Market!</hi> Your Taste here,
I suppose, rises no higher than your <hi>Shakespears</hi>
and your <hi>Johnsons</hi>; oh you <hi>Goats</hi> and
<hi>Vandils!</hi> in the Name of Barbarity take 'em
to yourselves, we are tir'd of 'em upon
Earth—one goes indeed to a Playhouse sometimes,
because one does not know how else
one can kill one's Time—every body goes, because
—because—all the World's there—but
for my part—call <hi>Scarroon,</hi> and let him take
me back again, I'll stay no longer here—
stupid Immortals!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>You are a happy Woman, that have
neither Cares nor Follies to disturb you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>Cares! ha! ha! ha! Nay, now
I must laugh in your ugly Face, my Dear:
What Cares, does your Wisdom think, can
enter into the Circle of a fine Lady's Enjoyments?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>By the Account I have just heard
of a fine Lady's Life, her very Pleasures are
both Follies and Cares; so drink the Water,
and forget them, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>Oh gad! that was so like my
Husband now—forget my Follies! forget the
Fashion, forget my Being, the very <hi>Quincettence</hi>
and <hi>Emptity</hi> of a fine Lady! the Fellow
wou'd make me as great a Brute as my
Husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>You have an Husband then, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="30" facs="37"/>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>Yes—I think so—an Husband
and no Husband—Come, fetch me some of
your Water; if I must forget something, I
had as good forget him, for he's grown insufferable
o'late.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I thought, Madam, you had nothing
to complain of—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>One's Husband, you know, is
almost next to nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>How has he offended you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>The Man talks of nothing but
his Money, and my Extravagance—won't remove
out of the filthy City, tho' he knows I
die for the other End of the Town; nor
leave off his nasty Merchandizing, tho' I've
labour'd to convince him, he loses Money
by it. The Man was once tolerable enough,
and let me have Money when I wanted it;
but now he's never out of a Tavern, and is
grown so valiant, that, do you know—he
has presum'd to contradict me, and refuse
me Money upon every Occasion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>And all this without any Provocation
on your Side?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>Laud! how shou'd I provoke
him? I seldom see him, very seldom speak
to the Creature, unless I want Money; besides,
he's out all Day—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>And you all Night, Madam; Is it
not so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>I keep the best Company, Sir,
and Day-light is no agreeable Sight to a polite
<pb n="31" facs="38"/>
Assembly; the Sun is very well and comfortable,
to be sure, for the lower Part of the
Creation; but to Ladies who have a true
Taste of Pleasure, Wax Candles, or no Candles,
are preferable to all the Sun-beams in
the Universe—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Preposterous Fancy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>And so, most delicate sweet
Sir, you don't approve my Scheme; ha! ha!
ha!—oh you ugly Devil you! have you the
Vanity to imagine People of Fashion will
mind what you say; or that to learn Politeness
and Breeding, it is necessary to take a
Lesson of Morality out of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Fables—
ha! ha! ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>It is necessary to get a little Reflection
some where; when these Spirits leave
you, and your Senses are surfeited, what must
be the Consequence?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Riot.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I have the best Receipt in
the World for the Vapours; and lest the
Poison of your Precepts shou'd taint my Vivacity,
I must beg leave to take it now, by
way of <hi>Anecdote.</hi></p>

Vanity!</p>

<sp>

<p>Pray, Sir, what brought you hither?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Man.</speaker>
<p>Curiosity, and a Hackney Coach.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I mean, Sir, have you any Occasion

</sp>
<sp>

<p>Yes, great Occasion; if you'll do

<p>Sir!</p>

<p>Sir!—Don't stare so, old Gentleman—
let us have a little Conversation with
you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I wou'd know if you have any
thing oppresses your Mind, and makes you
unhappy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Man.</speaker>
<p>You are certainly a very great
Fool, old Gentleman; did you ever know a
Man drunk and unhappy at the same?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Never otherwise, for a Man who
has lost his Senses—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Man.</speaker>
<p>Has lost the most troublesome
Companions in the World, next to Wives
and Bum-Bailiffs.</p>

<p>But, pray, what is your Business

</sp>
<sp>

you are an Ass—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Your humble Servant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="35" facs="42"/>
<speaker>D. Man.</speaker>
<p>And to shew you, that whilst I
can get such Liquor as I have been drinking
all Night, I shall never come for your
<hi>Water</hi> Specificks against Care and Tribulation:
However, old Gentleman, if you'll
do one thing for me, I shan't think my
Time and Conversation thrown away upon
you.</p>

<p>Any thing in my Power.</p>

one of the best Whores in your Territories.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Man.</speaker>
<p>To refresh myself in the Shades
here after my Journey.—Suppose now you
introduce me to <hi>Proserpine,</hi> who knows how
far my Figure and Address may tempt her;
and if her Majesty is over nice, shew me but
her Maids of Honour, and I'll warrant you
they'll snap at a Bit of fresh Mortality.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Monstrous!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>D. Man.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, if it is monstrous, I
say no more—if her Majesty and Retinue
are so very virtuous—I say no more;—but
I'll tell you what, old Friend, if you'll lend
me your Wife for half an Hour; when you
make a Visit above, you shall have mine as
long as you please; and if upon Trial you
shou'd like mine better than your own, you
shall carry her away to the Devil with you,
and ten thousand Thanks into the Bargain.</p>

upon your account; prithee, what possess'd
thee to write such foolish old Stories of a Cock

cruel in you, let me tell you that.</p>

<p>Is your Case particular, Friend?</p>

<p>No, indeed, I believe it is pretty general
in our Parish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>What is it? speak out, Friend—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>It runs continually in my Head, that
I am—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>A Cuckold—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Have a care, Friend, Jealousy is a
rank Weed, and chiefly takes Root in a barren
Soil.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>I am sure my Head is full of nothing
else—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>But how came you to a Knowledge
of your Misfortune? has not your Wife as
much Wit as you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>A great deal more, Sir, and that is
one Reason for my believing myself dishonour'd—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Tho' your Reason has some Weight
in it, yet it does not amount to a Conviction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>I have more to say for myself, if your
Worship will but hear me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="38" facs="45"/>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I shall attend to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>My Wife has such very High Blood
in her, that she is lately turn'd Papist, and
is always railing at me and the Government—
The Priest and she are continually
laying their Heads together, and I am afraid
he has persuaded her, that it will save her
precious Soul, if she cuckolds a Heretick Taylor—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Oh, don't think so hardly of 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>Lord, Sir, you don't know what
Tricks are going forward above; Religion,
indeed, is the Outside Stuff, but Wickedness
is the Lining.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>Why, you are in a Passion, Friend,
if you would but exert yourself thus at a
proper Time, you might keep the Fox from
your Poultry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>Lord, Sir, my Wife has as much
Passion again as I have; and whenever she's
up, I curb my Temper, sit down, and say
nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>What Remedy have you to propose
for this Misfortune?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>I would propose to dip my Head in
the River, to wash away my Fancies—and if
you'll let me take a few Bottles to my Wife,
if the Water is of a cooling Nature, I may
perhaps be easy that Way; but I shall do as
your Worship pleases.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="39" facs="46"/>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>I am afraid this Method won't answer,
Friend; suppose therefore you drink to
forget your Suspicions, for they are nothing
more, and let your Wife drink to forget your
Uneasiness—A mutual Confidence will succeed,
and consequently, mutual Happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>I have such a Spirit, I can never bear
to be dishonour'd in my Bed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
<p>The Water will cool your Spirit,
and if it can but lower your Wife's, the Business
is done.—Go for a Moment to your
Companion, and you shall drink presently;
but do nothing rashly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tay.</speaker>
<p>I can't help it, Rashness is my Fault,
Sir; but Age and more Experience, I hope,
will cure me—Your Servant, Sir—Indeed he
is a fine old <hi>Grecian.</hi></p>
