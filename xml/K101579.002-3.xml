<head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Countess of Litchfield.</head>
<opener><salute>MADAM,</salute></opener>
<p>I Have the honour of your LADYSHIP'S permission to present to you a Tragedy, which, though it met with numerous and unprecedented difficulties and discouragements in the theatre, will, I hope, be thought not altogether unworthy your protection in the world.—Indeed, if the unpopularity of its late situation could in the least affect that degree of merit, which your LADYSHIP'S candor, or the indulgence of the town, may allow it to have, it would ill become me to recommend
<pb n="iv" facs="228"/>
it to my readers, under the sanction of so polite and illustrious a name.—But your LADYSHIP has too much good sense, as well as generosity, to judge of this performance by mere appearances, and accidental or unlucky circumstances; and therefore, tho' it will stand as a kind of memorial of the bad fortune, and worse treatment of its author; it may at the same time be a proper testimony of the high respect with which I am,</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>THE Tragedy of <hi>Cymbeline</hi> is, in the whole oeconomy of it, one of the most irregular productions of <hi>Shakespeare.</hi> Its defects however, or rather its superfluities, are more than equalled by beauties, and excellencies of various kinds. There is at the same time something so pleasingly romantic, and likewise truly <hi>British</hi> in the subject of it, that, I flatter myself, an attempt to reduce it, as near as possible, to the regular standard of the <hi>drama,</hi> will be favourably received by all, who are admirers of <hi>novelty,</hi> when <hi>propriety</hi> is its foundation. I have accordingly endeavoured to new-construct this Tragedy, almost upon the plan of <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, in respect of the <hi>unity</hi> of <hi>Time;</hi> with so thorough a veneration however for the great <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> stage, that, even while I have presumed to regulate and modernize his design, I have thought it an honour to tread in his steps, and to imitate his Stile, with the humility and reverence of a <hi>Son.</hi> With this view, I have retained in <hi>many</hi> places the very language of the original author, and in
<pb n="vi" facs="230"/>
<hi>all</hi> others endeavoured to supply it with a diction similar thereunto; so that, as an unknown friend of mine has observed, the present attempt is intirely <hi>new,</hi> whether it be considered as an <hi>alteration from,</hi> or an <hi>imitation of Shakespeare.</hi></p>
<p>—The <hi>difficulty</hi> of such an attempt, as <hi>rational</hi> as it may be, has a kind of <hi>claim,</hi> I presume, to the <hi>indulgence</hi> of the public; especially as it has been attended likewise with <hi>disadvantages.</hi>—For I found myself necessitated by my plan to <hi>drop some</hi> characters, to <hi>contract others,</hi> and to omit <hi>some</hi> scenes and incidents of an interesting nature;—or rather to bring the substance and purport of them within the compass of a few short narrations.—A loss irreparable this, but that conveniencies are likewise to be thrown into the opposite scale; for as, I hope, I have not <hi>injured</hi> any characters by <hi>contracting</hi> them, but have left them to <hi>all intents,</hi> and in point of <hi>importance</hi> the <hi>same;</hi> so I have had an opportunity of <hi>enlarging</hi> and <hi>improving some</hi> of the original parts, (those particularly of <hi>Palador,</hi> and <hi>Philario,</hi> the <hi>Pisanio of Shakespeare)</hi> and, by varying certain incidents and circumstances, of giving a <hi>new cast</hi> to the whole <hi>drama.</hi>—After all, I am very far from meaning to detract from the merit of <hi>Shakespeare;</hi> or▪ from insinuating that the plays of so exalted a genius <hi>require</hi> such
<pb n="vii" facs="231"/>
new-modelling as the present, in order to the rendering them useful or entertaining.—I have ventured publicly to defend this great <hi>dramatic</hi> Poet in the liberties he has taken; but still <hi>Shakespeare</hi> himself needs not be <hi>ashamed</hi> to <hi>wear</hi> a <hi>modern dress,</hi> provided it can be made tolerably to <hi>fit</hi> him.</p>
<p>The only question then will be, whether the present <hi>alteration</hi> be a judicious one?—And this with all due deference is left to the candour and justice of the public.</p>
<p>It will be proper to acquaint the reader, that, this play, was recommended some time since by a person of the first distinction, to the manager of the other theatre; who declared, that he had the very same altered play in his possession, and that it was designed for representation on his stage. Our <hi>Cymbeline</hi> therefore was obliged to take up his head quarters at <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> where he has contended not only with the <hi>usual</hi> difficulties, but also with <hi>others</hi> of an <hi>extraordinary</hi> nature—Mrs. <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s declining the part of <hi>Imogen</hi> has done the play incredible prejudice; and convinces me of the vanity of striving against the stream of popularity in general, or the weight of particular disadvantages.—However, I am under obligations to <hi>many</hi>
<pb n="viii" facs="232"/>
of the performers, for their best endeavours to do justice to my piece, and for their zeal for its success. To <hi>some</hi> I am indebted for real service, whose names, as comparisons are invidious, I leave it to the judgment of the reader to supply.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, I am at a loss to ballance the account between myself and my fortune, in this whimsical situation. The kind assistance, and, I hope, not extremely partial approbation of <hi>some,</hi> adds as much to my <hi>credit</hi> and <hi>satisfaction,</hi> as the <hi>delicacy,</hi> or <hi>ill-nature,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>others,</hi> has deducted from my <hi>advantages.</hi>—To my <hi>friends,</hi> I return my sincere acknowledgments, and best wishes; to my <hi>enemies,</hi> I shall say nothing, 'till they are <hi>candid,</hi> and <hi>sagacious</hi> enough to speak more <hi>plainly</hi> than they have hitherto done,—and more <hi>to the purpose.</hi></p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<p>Spoken by Mr. ROSS.</p>
<lg>
<l>BRITONS, the daring Author of to-night,</l>
<l>Attempts in Shakespear's manly stile to write;</l>
<l>He strives to copy from that mighty mind</l>
<l>The glowing vein—the spirit unconfin'd—</l>
<l>The figur'd diction that disdain'd controul—</l>
<l>And the full vigour of the poet's soul!</l>
<l>—Happy the varied phrase, if none shall call,</l>
<l>This imitation, that original.—</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>For other points, our new advent'rer tries</l>
<l>The bard's luxuriant plan to modernize;</l>
<l>And, by the rules of antient art, refine</l>
<l>The same eventful, pleasing, bold design.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Our scenes awake not now the am'rous flame,</l>
<l>Nor teach soft swains to woo the tender dame;</l>
<l>Content, for bright example's sake, to shew</l>
<l>A wife distress'd, and innocence in woe.—</l>
<l>For what remains, the poet bids you see,</l>
<l>From an old tale, what Britons ought to be;</l>
<l>And in these restless days of war's alarms,</l>
<l>Not melts the soul to love, but fires the blood to arms.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb n="x" facs="234"/>
<l>Your great forefathers scorn'd the foreign chain,</l>
<l>Rome might invade, and Caesars rage in vain—</l>
<l>Those glorious patterns with bold hearts pursue,</l>
<l>To king, to country, and to honour true!—</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Oh! then with candour and good will attend,</l>
<l>Applaud the author in the cordial friend:</l>
<l>Remember, when his failings most appear,</l>
<l>It ill becomes the brave to be severe.—</l>
<l>Look ages back, and think you hear to-night</l>
<l>An antient poet, still your chief delight!</l>
<l>Due to a great attempt compassion take,</l>
<l>And spare the modern bard for Shakespear's sake.</l>
</lg>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<p>Spoken by Mrs. VINCENT.</p>
<lg>
<l>WELL, Sirs—the bus'ness of the day is o'er,</l>
<l>And I'm a princess, and a wife no more—</l>
<l>This bard of our's, with Shakespear in his head,</l>
<l>May be well-taught, but surely is ill-bred.</l>
<l>Spouse gone, coast clear, wife handsome, and what not,</l>
<l>We might have had a much genteeler plot.</l>
<l>What madness equals true poetic rage?</l>
<l>Fine stuff! a lady in a hermitage!</l>
<l>A pretty mansion for the blooming fair—</l>
<l>No tea, no scandal,—no intriguing there.—</l>
<l><pb n="xi" facs="235"/>
—The gay beau-monde such hideous scenes must damn—</l>
<l>What! nothing modish, but one cordial dram!</l>
<l>—Yet after all, the poet bids me say,</l>
<l>For your own credit's sake approve the play;</l>
<l>You can't for shame condemn old British wit,</l>
<l>(I hope there are no Frenchmen in the pit)</l>
<l>Or slight a timely tale, that well discovers,</l>
<l>The bravest soldiers are the truest lovers.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Such Leonatus was, in our romance,</l>
<l>A gallant courtier, tho' he cou'd not dance;</l>
<l>Say, wou'd you gain, like him, the fair one's charms,</l>
<l>First try your might in hardy deeds of arms;</l>
<l>Your muffs, your coffee, and down-beds fore-go,</l>
<l>Follow the mighty Prussia thro' the snow;</l>
<l>At length bring home the honourable scar,</l>
<l>And love's sweet balm shall heal the wounds of war.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>For me, what various thoughts my mind perplex?</l>
<l>Is't better I resume my feeble sex,</l>
<l>Or wear this manly garb? it fits me well—</l>
<l>Gallants instruct me—ladies, can you tell?</l>
<l>The court's divided, and the gentle beaux,</l>
<l>Cry—no disguises—give the girl her cloaths.</l>
<l>The ladies say, to-night's example teaches,</l>
<l>(And I will take their words without more speeches)</l>
<l>That things go best when—women wear the breeches.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>2d LORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>I think your wish to breathe in foreign air,</l>
<l>Took you away about the very time</l>
<l>The royal babes were stolen.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st LORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>It is true, sir—</l>
<l>Some twenty years ago—'twas a strange theft,</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="238"/>
But the concealment stranger; for you tell me,</l>
<l>That to this hour there is no guess in knowlege</l>
<l>Which way they went.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d LORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>No, sir—albeit search</l>
<l>Was hot in the enquiry—but much time</l>
<l>Has worn out all that miracle—fresh matter</l>
<l>Supplying wonder since.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st LORD.</speaker>
<l>Of which my ignorance</l>
<l>Is not yet perfect learner.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d LORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Well then, heed me.</l>
<l>Our late good queen (you knew her, sir) whose age</l>
<l>Was thought t'advance beyond more hope of children,</l>
<l>Yet brought the joyful Cymbeline a daughter,</l>
<l>And to his kingdoms a most hopeful heir,</l>
<l>In lieu of those he lost: for Imogen</l>
<l>(Such is her name) took all the graces in,</l>
<l>Which the best wisdom of the times put to her,</l>
<l>As we do air, fast as 'tis minister'd.</l>
<l>If beauty, innocence, and gentleness</l>
<l>Are woman's rarest jewels, she is rich</l>
<l>In most full measure of possession.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st LORD.</speaker>
<l>You speak her fair.</l>

<sp>

<l>But not to flatter, sir,</l>
<l>Tho' I should talk the sun down. You have heard</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="239"/>
The bright side of the story, for the other</l>
<l>It has a sable hue—I'll be brief with it—</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st LORD.</speaker>
<l>Do, but be plain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d LORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>The queen quits mortal being;</l>
<l>And Cymbeline, tho' now in wane of life,</l>
<l>Takes to his lonely bed a second dame,</l>
<l>A widow, bold, ambitious, cunning, cruel,</l>
<l>That rul'd his heart by acting what she was not:</l>
<l>She mov'd the cred'lous king to wed his daughter</l>
<l>With Cloten, her own son, a wretch in whom</l>
<l>All qualities that dub a worthy man</l>
<l>Are low as worst report.—The princess cast</l>
<l>Disdain upon his suit—and in mean time</l>
<l>My plotting stepdame dies.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st LORD.</speaker>
<l>A lucky death!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d LORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>'Twas thought so.—But the king, in whom this weakness</l>
<l>Is his first point of fault, pursues the aim</l>
<l>Of his now dead belov'd, and wills the maid</l>
<l>To take the crown with this encumbrance Cloten,</l>
<l>Or hold her birth-right void.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>1st LORD.</speaker>
<l>Alas! poor lady.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d LORD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Nay there's more woe behind.—Sweet Imogen</l>
<l>Had long been list'ning to the earnest suit</l>
<l>Of Leonatus, a young lord o'th' court,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="240"/>
A valiant, frank, and honest gentleman,</l>
<l>That has no vice, if poverty be none;</l>
<l>And to say all, as much unlike to Cloten</l>
<l>As man can be to man.—Him in pure love,</l>
<l>And to undo all aims, she weds, and makes</l>
<l>The deed soon known her boast: th'enraged king</l>
<l>Sends Leonatus into banishment,</l>
<l>And her within the circle of this castle</l>
<l>Enforceth to abide, till she consent</l>
<l>To break her bond to her new-wedded lord</l>
<l>By strong propos'd divorce.—This is the sum</l>
<l>Of what you wish'd to hear.</l>

<l>As their humours vary;</l>
<l>Some blame the king, all pity Imogen,</l>

<l>This tribute, we were free.—Our Britain is</l>

<l>Sir, when late to Britain</l>
<l>I came in peaceful embassy to claim</l>
<l>This yet contested tribute, I remember</l>
<l>The boast that fill'd your mouth—you vaunted then</l>
<l>The nat'ral brav'ry of your isle, which stands</l>
<l>As Neptune's park ribbed and paled in</l>
<l>With rocks unscaleable, and roaring waters,</l>
<l>With sands that would not bear your enemies boats,</l>
<l>But suck them up to th' topmast.—We have leaped</l>

<lg>
<l>My lord, as soon</l>
<l>As I had foot in Italy, I challeng'd</l>
<l>Th' abused Leonatus with some friends</l>
<l>To the appointment of a merry meeting;</l>
<l>Where, as the wine danc'd brainward, I began</l>
<l>To praise the freedom of the British ladies,</l>
<l>Their lib'ral hearts, and am'rous 'complishments;</l>
<l>When Leonatus vow'd I did them wrong,</l>
<l>And was too bold in my persuasion.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLOTEN.</speaker>
<l>So.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PISANIO.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>I fast held me to my sentiment,</l>
<l>And, for his doubt provok'd me, swore myself</l>
<l>Had tasted half the court, and his own princess,</l>

<l>And bids my ready sword avow th' affront</l>
<l>Done his pure lady's honour—I with looks</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="248"/>
Of calm assurance, and arms folded thus,</l>
<l>Wish'd him attend my proofs. This fair proposal</l>
<l>Had sanction from all sides, and liquor'd noddles</l>
<l>Jostled to hear my tale.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLOTEN.</speaker>
<l>Why so—Proceed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PISANIO.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>First, roundly I describ'd her bed-chamber,</l>
<l>The arras, cieling, pictures; (for of these</l>
<l>I took most faithful inventory, when</l>
<l>I lay concealed there); then I produc'd</l>
<l>The bracelet that I ravish'd from her arm,</l>
<l>As sleep, the ape of death, lay dull upon her;</l>
<l>And last I quoted the cinque-spotted mole</l>
<l>That richly stains her breast, like crimson drops</l>
<l>I'th'bottom of a cowslip.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLOTEN.</speaker>

<l>There was voucher</l>

<l>To this the Briton?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PISANIO.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>He was quite besides</l>
<l>The government of patience—He roll'd round</l>
<l>His bloodshot eyes, stamp'd with his foot, and writh'd</l>
<l>His form into all postures; strove to speak,</l>
<l>And chatter'd monkey-like;—at length, his choler</l>
<l>Burst into utt'rance rash—'tis well, he cried,</l>
<l>The fiends of hell divide themselves between you—</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="249"/>
And so without more ceremony, left</l>
<l>Our board, to cast conjectures, as they might,</l>
<l>Whereto his fury tended.</l>

<l>To bloody purpose of revenge.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLOTEN.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>'Tis good—</l>
<l>Pisanio, I did love this lady—lie</l>
<l>I should not, if I said I love her still—</l>

<l>She hath disdain'd me—spurn'd me—once she vow'd,</l>
<l>The meanest garment that e'er clip'd the body</l>
<l>Of Leonatus, was in her respect</l>
<l>Dearer than all the hairs upon my head,</l>

<l>That pricks your side of greatness. If he 'scape</l>
<l>The snare that traps him now, and haply live</l>
<l>To recognize his country and his queen,</l>
<l>Your crown will totter—for the lady keeps</l>
<l>High seat in ev'ry heart; and for her husband,</l>
<l>(I speak in envy this) thro' Italy</l>

<l>I have no other hate than what I bear</l>
<l>Him, and his fortunes; for his kinder stars</l>
<l>Have still eclipsed mine: but I will shroud me</l>
