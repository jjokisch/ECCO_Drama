<head>TO Sir <hi>RICHARD STEELE.</hi></head>
<p>WHEN Men cast their Eyes upon Epistles of this Kind, from the Name of the Person who makes the Address, and of Him who receives it, they usually have Reason to expect Applauses improper either to be given or accepted by the Parties concern'd. I fear it will, at first Sight, be much more so in this Address, than any other which has at any Time appear'd; but while common Dedications are stuff'd with painful Panegyricks, the plain and honest Business of this, is, only to do an Act of Justice, and to End a former Misunderstanding between the Author, and Him, whom She, here, makes Her Patron. In Consideration that one knows not how far what We have said of each other, may affect our Character in the World, I take it for an Act of Honour to declare, on my Part, that I have not known a greater Mortification than when I have reflected upon the Severities which have flow'd from a Pen, which is now, You see, dispos'd as much to celebrate and commend You. On Your Part, Your sincere Endeavour to promote the Reputation
<pb facs="5"/>
and Success of this TRAGEDY, are infallible Testimonies of the Candour and Friendship you retain for Me. I rejoice in this publick Retribution, and with Pleasure acknowledge, That I find by Experience, that some useful Notices which I had the good Fortune to give You for Your Conduct in former Life, with some hazard to my Self, were not to be blotted out of Your Memory by any Hardships that follow'd them.</p>
<p>I KNOW You so well, that I am assur'd You already think I have, on this Subject, said too much; and I am confident You believe of Me, that did I not conceal much more, I should not say so much. Be then the very Memory of disagreeable Things forgotten for ever, and give Me leave to Thank You for Your Kindness to this PLAY, and in return, to shew towards Your Merit the same Good-will. But when my Heart is full, and my Pen ready to express the kindest Sentiments to Your Advantage, I reflect upon what I have formerly heard You say, That the Fame of a Gentleman, like the Credit of a Merchant, must flow from his own intrinsick Value; and that all Means to enlarge it, which do not arise naturally from That real Worth, instead of promoting the Character of either, did but lessen and render it suspicious. I leave You therefore, to the great Opportunities, which are daily in Your Power, of bestowing on Your Self, what no Body else can give You; and wishing You Health and Prosperity, I omit to dwell upon some very late
<pb facs="6"/>
Actions of Yours in Publick, which unhappy Prejudices made, as little expected from You, as the Zeal and Sollicitude which You shew'd for my private Interests in the Success of this PLAY. I shall say no more, trusting to the Gallantry of Your Temper for further Proofs of Friendship; and allowing You, like a true Woman, all the good Qualities in the World now I am Pleas'd with You, as well as I gave You all the ill One's when I was Angry with You: I remain with the greatest Truth,</p>

<head>THE PREFACE.</head>
<p><hi>I</hi> Cannot suffer this <hi>PLAY</hi> to pass into the World, without expressing my Gratitude to the Ladies, who, in such a distinguishing Manner, graced and supported it. So much Beauty and good Nature, could not fail of rend'ring that Person happy, for whose Benefit they were employ'd: I think my self infinitely bless'd in their Smiles, since I can be sensible of no greater Glory, than to hear, that I have had the Honour to Please Them.</p>
<p>TO tell the World that Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Oldfield's</hi> Action was admirable, in the Parts of <hi>LUCIUS</hi> and <hi>ROSALINDA,</hi> is saying nothing New; they are so us'd to Charm the Audience, and Delight the best Judges of the Theatre: However, I beg leave to make them my publick Acknowledgments, and to please my self with what I have heard reported of their Performance in this <hi>PLAY,</hi> which is, That tho' they have
<pb facs="8"/>
often shin'd in several greater Parts, yet, none ever became them better. Mr. <hi>Booth's</hi> masterly and graceful Action supported <hi>LUCIUS;</hi> whilst Mrs. <hi>Oldfield's</hi> Charms, and enchanting Manner, gave Life and Beauty to the <hi>QUEEN.</hi></p>

<lg>
<l><hi>NAT Lee,</hi> for Buskins fam'd, would often say,</l>
<l>To Stage-Success He had a certain Way;</l>
<l>Something for all the People must be done,</l>
<l>And with some Circumstance each Order won;</l>
<l>This He thought easy, as to make a Treat,</l>
<l>And, for a Tragedy, gave this Receipt.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Take me, said He, a Princess Young and Fair,</l>
<l>Then take a Blooming Victor flush'd with War;</l>
<l>Let Him not owe, to vain Report, Renown,</l>
<l>But in the Ladies Sight cut Squadrons down;</l>
<l>Let Him, whom they themselves saw win the Field,</l>
<l>Him to whose Sword they saw whole Armies yield,</l>
<l>Approach the Heroin with dread Surprise,</l>
<l>And own no Valour Proof against bright Eyes:</l>
<l><pb facs="10"/>
The Boxes are Your own—the Thing is hit,</l>
<l>And Ladies, as they near each other sit,</l>
<l>Cry, oh! <hi>How movingly that Scene is writ?</hi></l>
<l>For all the Rest, with Ease, Delights you'll sbape,</l>
<l>Write for the Heroes in the Pit, a <hi>Rape:</hi></l>
<l>Give the First Gallery a <hi>Ghost;</hi> on th' Upper,</l>
<l>Bestow, tho' at that distance, a good <hi>Supper.</hi></l>
<l>Thus all their Fancies, working their own Way,</l>
<l>They're Pleas'd, and think they owe it to the Play.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But the Ambitious Author of these Scenes,</l>
<l>With no low Arts, to court your Favour means;</l>
<l>With Her Success, and Disappointment, move,</l>
<l>On the just Laws of Empire, and of Love!</l>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>By a Young GENTLEMAN.</byline>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. Walker.</stage>
<lg>
<l>IN ancient Days (the Time we do not know,</l>
<l>It is so very, very long ago)</l>
<l><hi>Envy</hi> was forc'd to lead an harmless Life,</l>
<l>To stay at home, a meer <hi>Italian</hi> Wife.</l>
<l>Wou'd ye believe it, Ladies? Tet, 'tis true,</l>
<l>She had not learn'd to Dress like One of Tou:</l>
<l>Nor did she then appear a thoughtless Beau,</l>
<l>Nor wore Cockades, nor into Armies go.</l>
<l>To Play-houses she ne'er presum'd to come,</l>
<l>And rarely visited the Drawing-room:</l>
<l>Ev'n Masquerades, where no One shews the Face,</l>
<l>Would not admit of <hi>Envy</hi> in the Place.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Ah! happy Days, when Dulness fear'd no Lash,</l>
<l>The Author gave no Wit, yet got his Cash:</l>
<l>When an Attempt to Please, was taken well,</l>
<l>And, on weak Woman, never Critick fell.</l>
<l>But our new Taste, brings on a new Demand,</l>
<l>For Wit alone, at present, cannot stand;</l>
<l><pb facs="12"/>
You must have Scandal, Politicks, and Traps,</l>
<l>To raise the Ladies Blush, and Footmens Claps.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>What can poor We expect, in such a Case?</l>
<l>Dare <hi>English</hi> Tragedy plead Hopes of Grace?</l>
<l>No Party favour'd, no Designs in view,</l>
<l>To make Old Times, club Faction with the New.</l>
<l>No <hi>double</hi> soft <hi>Entenders</hi> to excite,</l>
<l>No Politicks to please the Wise to Night,</l>
<l>Such a dull Play, could any Modern write?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Alas! we own the Allegation just,</l>
<l>But 'tis to You, the shining Fair we trust;</l>
<l>As You are Fair, our Author hopes to find,</l>
<l>You can Forgive, and then You will be Kind.</l>

<l>WHY does the conqu'ring <hi>Lucius</hi> now despond;</l>
<l>Why does my Lord, with secret Sorrow mourn,</l>
<l>Why thus averse to every Sound of Joy;</l>
<l>When <hi>Fortune</hi> crowns you with her choicest Favours,</l>
<l>Makes you the Soldiers Pride, and Wish of Beauty?</l>
<l>The coldest Maid that ever grac'd a Court,</l>

<l>And her long-practis'd Scorn is then no more.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>O <hi>Albany!</hi> I cannot bear thy search.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>I must proceed, and name the beauteous Queen.</l>

<l>The mourning <hi>Rosalind</hi> in Sorrow dress'd,</l>

<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="15"/>

<l>My Friend, does she not rule thy Soul?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>She does! she does! my charming Queen reigns here,</l>
<l>Triumphant in her native Throne, my Heart:</l>
<l>Diffusive is her Sway, War yields to Love,</l>
<l>Nor know I any Wish, but for her Beauty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<l>Oh sure Despair, as certain Death for me!</l>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>Why sighs my Friend? Is she not heav'nly Fair?</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<l>Oh Guardian Powers of <hi>Britain!</hi> save him now,</l>
<l>Oh save the lovely Youth from pleasing Ruin!</l>
<l>Hast thou forgot? alas! the Queen's a Christian,</l>
<l>Apostate to our Altars, and our Worship.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>In her alone all my Devotion centers;</l>
<l>My Heart (when I such wond'rous Charms survey)</l>
<l>In her adores the All-creating Power.</l>
<l>Nor can Perfections, great as hers, mislead;</l>
<l>She cannot be mistaken; cannot err:</l>
<l>Or if she cou'd, with <hi>Rosalind</hi> to err,</l>
<l>Were better than believing with another!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<l>Beware the Mischiefs which attend her Love.</l>
<l>Thy Father, styl'd, the cruel King of <hi>Britain,</hi></l>
<l>Is to the Christian Sect a most invet'rate Foe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>Love were not Love, cou'd it admit of Fear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<l>Think how, when Lord of <hi>Verulam,</hi> he slew</l>
<l>The good, the rightful Majesty of <hi>Britain;</hi></l>
<l>Slew, at a peaceful Banquet, that brave Monarch.</l>
<l>The Queen (scarce up from Childbed of a Son,</l>
<l>Who soon expir'd) he forc'd to his loath'd Bed,</l>
<l>In hopes the Prince of <hi>Cambria,</hi> her Brother,</l>
<l>Wou'd prove a Friend, to his bold Usurpation:</l>
<l>And yet Heav'n smil'd upon the horrid Nuptials,</l>
<l>And bless'd the Tyrant with the God-like <hi>Lucius.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>Tho' sprung from one, I have no Tyrant's Soul,</l>
<l>Am I to blame? Cou'd I direct my Birth?</l>
<l>Cou'd I concur to Be? Was the Choice mine?</l>
<l>My Mother early paid the Debt of Nature;</l>
<l>Of me she dy'd: may that attone the Crime</l>
<l>Of wedding with her Husband's Murderer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<l>Still, there's a Secret will thy Hopes destroy,</l>
<l>Thy Father does himself the Queen adore;</l>
<l>His Love began, soon after thou wert sent</l>
<l>To aid the <hi>Gallick</hi> King against his Brother.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>O fatal War! wou'd I had never seen it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<l>Thy Father, at a Royal Interview,</l>
<l>Receiv'd a Dart from <hi>Rosalinda's</hi> Eyes,</l>
<l>The beauteous Heiress of my Uncle's Crown,</l>
<l>Then to the King of <hi>Aquitain</hi> betroth'd:</l>
<l>He strove in vain to cross the promis'd Nuptials,</l>
<l>For his own Bed courting the destin'd Bride.</l>
<l>Long Enmity between the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britons,</hi></l>
<l>Their native Hate, and Contract with <hi>Otharius,</hi></l>
<l>Caus'd the Refusal of your Father's Suit.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>The Fame of this Affront reach'd us abroad.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<l>Love was the secret Motive of the War;</l>
<l>Hence he invaded <hi>Albany</hi> with Fury:</l>
<l>And with my Uncle's Death the Slight reveng'd.</l>
<l>How has he gall'd the <hi>Picts</hi> with heavy Yokes!</l>
<l>How every Day oppress'd our conquer'd People!</l>
<l>How in these foreign Wars, and distant Climes</l>
<l>Forc'd us for him to carry hated Arms!</l>
<l>Eager to prosecute his furious Love,</l>
<l>He cross'd the Seas to make the Queen a Widow.</l>
<l>Too well his Chance in War succeeded here;</l>
<l><hi>Otharius,</hi> he was slain, and we the Victors.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>This Morning with the <hi>Gallick</hi> King he comes</l>
<l>Triumphant o'er the Fate of <hi>Aquitain.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<l>Soon as your conqu'ring Arms had forc'd this City,</l>
<l>With Orders I was sent to plead his Love:</l>
<l>But she, with Indignation, has refus'd him.</l>
<l>I dread to say, how ill I have succeeded.</l>
<l>His Tyrant Temper will not yield to Reason,</l>
<l>Nor can the Name of Son, abate his Rage.</l>
<l>Cure or conceal your Love, or you are lost.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>Conceal my Love? conceal a raging Fire,</l>
<l>Conceal the Blaze, when it invades the Sky:</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="17"/>
As well unbounded Storms may be conceal'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<l>Sure this Etherial Fire was struck by <hi>Jove.</hi></l>
<l>Oh no! the God of Love has greater force;</l>
<l>He animates you thus; thus moves your Frame,</l>
<l>And brings inimitable Graces with him.</l>
<l>Feels not the Queen the Force of all those Charms?</l>
<l>A Dawn of Joy breaks from her gath'ring Smiles,</l>
<l>With all the Softness, which fore-runs her Sex's Yielding.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<l>Ten Months I've offer'd ineffectual Vows;</l>
<l>Ten Months pursu'd the Fair with ardent Love.</l>
<l>No more—the Princess <hi>Emmelin</hi> appears:</l>
<l>I'll go this very Hour, and urge my Fate;</l>
<l>Ere my stern Father comes, I must be bless'd,</l>
<l>Be ever bless'd, or else for ever wretched.</l>
<l>Haste all ye Loves, and Graces to my aid;</l>
<l>Dwell on my Voice, and languish in my Eyes;</l>
<l>Bright <hi>Cytherea,</hi> from thy Heav'n look down,</l>
<l>Grant, <hi>Venus,</hi> grant, that I her Heart may move;</l>
<l>For me thy Slave, make her thy Votary.</l>

<l>Alas! too well.</l>
</sp>

<l>And grows the Hero, <hi>Lucius,</hi> sick for Love?</l>
<l>That stubborn Heart in Camps, and Slaughter bred,</l>
<l>Unus'd to Beauty and its soft Delights?</l>
<l>Oh Sympathy of Sex! oh Force of Nature!</l>
<l>What haughty Victor stops not at thy Call?</l>
<l>What Courage melts not at the sight of Beauty?</l>
<l>Oh <hi>Rosalind!</hi> how glorious are thy Chains!</l>
<l>How much superior to the Crowns of others!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arm.</speaker>
<l>As next of Kindred to the <hi>Alban</hi> Throne,</l>
<l>Whilst none but elder Rivals had declar'd,</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="18"/>
I had some distant Hopes of being heard.</l>

<l>If I have Credit with the King, you shall;</l>
<l>We are my Brother's Captives, not the <hi>Britons.</hi></l>
<l>But oh! what Hope hast thou to gain her Heart?</l>
<l>Where is the Hero, that dares rival <hi>Lucius?</hi></l>
<l>At the young Warrior's Sight, each Virgin Breast</l>
<l>Throbs with an Extacy unutterable.</l>
<l>Scarce <hi>Venus</hi> feels more Transport in her Grove,</l>
<l>When kindling Wishes hurry on to Love.</l>

<l>I own the Danger of superior Charms;</l>
<l>I own, his Power and Valour, Youth and Form,</l>
<l>Are Rivals dreadful to my boldest Hopes:</l>

<l>Cunning and Conduct may out-wit the Hero,</l>
<l>And aid my feeble Hand to reach his Heart.</l>

<l>Thou strik'st not there, <hi>Arminius;</hi> I oppose;</l>
<l>And, like his better Genius, guard the Warrior.</l>

<l>Be he immortal then, as are your Charms,</l>
<l>Within that beauteous Empire ever safe.</l>

<l>Thou hast resolv'd his Fate, I read thy Soul,</l>
<l>This ten long Months I've study'd thy dark Breast</l>
<l>And know the Want of Vertue in thy Frame,</l>
<l>Which must subject thee to the Mind, that knows thee:</l>

<l>Without a Rival now, you fill the Throne;</l>

<l>Speak, King of <hi>Britain,</hi> what is't thou wou'd'st ask?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Vor.</speaker>
<l>For all our Toils in War, our Soldiers Loss,</l>
<l>Our friendly lavish waste, of Blood and Treasure,</l>
<l>We ask the Captive Queen; that she, this Night,</l>
<l>Set forward, where our Royal Navy rides;</l>
<l><pb n="16" facs="29"/>
So to be wafted o'er to <hi>Britain's</hi> Shore,</l>
<l>With Honour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>Oh Brother! let me lowly thus entreat,</l>
<l>That I may answer this Tyrannick King:</l>
<l>With his great Merit, how are you upbraided?</l>
<l>He has recited all his warlike Deeds,</l>
<l>To make Impression on your grateful Heart.</l>
<l>But Sir! consider, I'm a Queen, was doubly Crown'd:</l>
<l>By Birth and Marriage, I am twice a Sovereign.</l>
<l>Think whose I was—Oh! pity Kindred Grief,</l>
<l>And Royal Woes! Mine's not a vulgar Fate,</l>
<l>To be weigh'd out by ev'ry common Hand,</l>
<l>Or at a Moment's Call, to be determin'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Vor.</speaker>
<l>What Phantoms, what Illusions, beauteous Queen,</l>
<l>(By melancholy Vapours fed) affright you?</l>
<l>Were <hi>Caesar</hi> yours, and all that vast Dominion</l>
<l>Of which he once could call himself the Lord,</l>
<l>Less sure, less absolute wou'd be your Sway,</l>
<l>Than now in <hi>Britain.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Queen.</speaker>
<l>In Death, I may possess an ample Pow'r:</l>
<l>'Tis there that I must follow, when thou lead'st.</l>
<l>I had a Father, 'till thy cruel Thirst</l>
<l>Of Blood and Empire left him but a Name.</l>
<l>I had a Husband too, of Kingly Sway:</l>
<l>Now made an helpless Orphan, and a Widow:</l>
<l>My Country seiz'd, my noble Friends enslav'd,</l>
<l>Groaning in Dungeons, courting Death in vain:</l>
<l>The next is mine, my Fate may be the last.</l>
<l>In me thy Tyranny will be accomplish'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Vor.</speaker>
<l>In you the War, in you what's dreadful ends;</l>
<l>The Prison-Doors fly open, as you pass;</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. <hi>Hon.</hi></speaker>
<l>With the same View, I give the Royal Bride:</l>
<l>To Morrow, see their Happiness compleat.</l>
<l>Next, let us seek to sooth this lovely Mourner:</l>
<l>Nor should'st thou, King of <hi>Britain,</hi> bar our Justice.</l>
<l>The Queen was not a Warrior, like her Lord,</l>
<l>Nor Partner of his Arms, or his Injustice:</l>
<l>Wherefore, we have resolv'd, she shall be free.</l>
<l>Madam, this Moment gives you Liberty;</l>

<l>You've leave to sojourn in our Court at Pleasure.</l>

<l>What Thanks, bright Princess, shall I pay to you,</l>
<l>And your great Brother, who has help'd to save me?<stage>[to Emm.</stage></l>
<l>That I have pass'd the threat'ned Storms of Fate,</l>
<l>Aveng'd my Parents, and preserv'd my Wife,</l>
<l>Are Blessings first deriv'd to me from Beauty.</l>
<l>Benighted, grov'ling on my Mother Earth,</l>
<l>'Till Beauty call'd, I unenlightned lay:</l>
<l>By Beauty lead, I sought eternal Day.</l>
<l>I view those shining Realms of Light above,</l>
<l>And gain immortal Happiness by Love.</l>
<stage>[Exeunt omnes.</stage>
