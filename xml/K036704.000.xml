<head>PROLOGUE,</head>
<byline>WRITTEN BY T. W. FITZGERALD, Esq. Spoken by Mr. Macready.</byline>
<sp>
<l>WHEN invalids possess both faith and wealth,</l>
<l>They'll find a nostrum to restore their health;</l>
<l>A <hi>panacea</hi> advertis'd to cure</l>
<l>Each ill the human body can endure.</l>
<l>But our bold Author claims a nobler art,</l>
<l>And advertises to relieve—the heart.</l>
<l>So many patients he expects to see,</l>
<l>That I'm appointed as his deputy.</l>
<l>Now, then, your mental maladies explain,</l>
<l>And I'll remove or mitigate the pain.</l>
<l>Does love or jealousy your peace molest,</l>
<l>Revenge inflame, ambition gnaw your breast?</l>
<l>For jealousy, a sovereign balm behold,—</l>
<l>The husband's certain cure, a pill of gold;</l>
<l>This dose, administer'd with prudent care,</l>
<l>Dispels at once the frailties of the fair;</l>
<l>Deprives the proctor of his <hi>crim. con.</hi> fee,</l>
<l>And tunes the chord that jar'd to harmony.</l>
<l>Should love torment some Romeo's heated brain,</l>
<l>Or agonize a Juliet's breast with pain,</l>
<l>Let them my potent remedy apply,—</l>
<l>The maid shall cease to pine, the youth to sigh;</l>
<l>Gold shall restore each drooping lover's health,</l>
<l>And passion sind a substitute in wealth.</l>
<l>But let not ill-tim'd ridicule degrade</l>
<l>What Heav'n, when well applied, a blessing made.</l>
<l>To foster merit, wheresoever found,</l>
<l>And with improvement cheer a country round;</l>
<l>To feed the hungry, and to clothe the poor,</l>
<l>And send the beggar happy from the door;</l>
<l>To mitigate the horrors of despair,</l>
<l>And make the family of want our care;</l>
<l>To succour genius, drooping in distress,</l>
<l>Making the business of our lives to bless.</l>
<l>When the rich man can such employment find,</l>
<l>We wish his purse as ample as his mind.</l>
<l>For one poor patient I've an anxious fear;</l>
<l>And you must be his kind physician here.</l>
<l>Our Author has to night so much at stake,</l>
<l>He finds his throbbing heart inclin'd to ache!</l>
<l>But should his play a lib'ral audience please,</l>
<l>Your warm applause will set his heart at ease.</l>

<div3 n="1" type="scene">
<head>SCENE I.</head><stage><hi>A Farm Yard. House on one Side, a neat Flower-Garden on the other. The Bells of a Team jingling.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANK </speaker>
<stage>(without.)</stage>
<p>WOYH! Whoh! Smiler! <stage>(Enters.)</stage> So Feyther be not come home from the Nabob's house yet. Eh! bean't that sister Jessy, in her garden, busy among the poseys?—Sister Jessy!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> JESSY <hi>from the Garden, a watering-pot in her hand.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Frank! so soon returned from Gloucester? have you sold the corn?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Ees.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>And how did you like the town? you were never there before?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Loike it! I don't know how I loiked it, not I; L zomehow cou'dn't zee the town for the housen: desperate zight of 'em, to be sure.—But Jessy, you who went to Lunnun Town to take in your larning, can tell me, be there as many houses in Lunnun?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>A hundred times the number.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>And do your 'squires there, like Sir Hubert Stanley, and the Nabob here, keep fine coaches?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Frank; there are some thousands round St. James's Gate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>St. James's Geat! Dong it; it wou'd be worth a poor man's while to stand and open that geat.—Pray you, where do that geat lead to?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>The road to preferment, Frank.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Ecod, if your road to preferment be so cramm'd wi' your coaches and great folk, no wonder a poor man be run down when he tries to get a bit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>You seem to be in terrible good spirits, Jessy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>I have reason, Frank. I have just received a letter from my dear Edward, who has left London on business with his father, Mr. Rapid, and will be here to day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>I suppose it to be a desperate long letter, and cruel sweet. Full of kisses and voluntines.— Nine sheets, I warrant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Hardly nine words. The truth is, that Edward, tho' handsome, generous, and I hope sincere, is impatient and hasty to a degree that—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Hasty! What then? when a man be on the road to do good, he can't go too fast, I say.— Bean't that Feyther coming thro' Wheat Ash? he have been drinking and gamestring all good Sunday night wi' Nabob's servants,—how whitish and deadly bad he do look. He us'd to be as comely and handsome as either of us, wasn't he now? Do you know, Jessy, at church yesterday, Sir Hubert, looking round, as he always do to see if his tenants be there, missed Feyther, and gave me such a desperate look, that I dropt prayer book out of my hand; and truly when Feyther do go to church I be always sham'd he never knows where to fin the collect—never—I'm sure it be not my fault, he be so full of prodigality—
<pb n="7" facs="6"/>never son set Feyther better example than I do's mine; what can I do more for 'un? it would not be becoming in me to leather Feather, would it, Jessy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Here he comes, I'll return to my garden— to converse with him is to me dreadful; for, while my breast rises with indignation at his conduct as a man, it sinks again in pity for the misfortunes of a parent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Now that's just like I—I feels as if I should like to lick 'un, and cry all the time—But what will be the end on't, Jessy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Ruin, inevitable ruin!</p>
<stage>(despondingly).</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Well don't thee be cast down—thee knows I be cruel kind to thee; at meals I always gis thee the desperate nice bits, and if thy lover prove false hearted, or Feyther should come to decay, I be a terrible strong lad, I'll work for thee fra sunrise to down, and if any one offer to harm thee, I'll fight for thee till I die.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Thanks, my good lad! thanks, dear brother.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Kisses him, and exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>As nice a bit of a sister that, as in all country round.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> FARMER OATLAND <hi>(dressed in a compound of rusticity and fashion.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Oatld. </speaker>
<stage>(singing.)</stage>
<p>Ba viamo tutti tra.—Dom it, this be what I call loife! Have you sold the wheat?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Ees.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oatld.</speaker>
<p>How much?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Two load—Six and twenty pound.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oatld. </speaker>
<stage>(yawning.)</stage>
<p>Exactly the trifle I lost last night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oatld.</speaker>
<p>Take it to the Nabob's gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>I were going Feyther, to the castle, to ge it to Sir Hubart's steward for rent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oatld.</speaker>
<p>Rent, you bore! That for Sir Hubert. <stage>(snapping his fingers).</stage> Ah, Nabob's servants be the tippy.—Every thing be done by them so genteelly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="7"/>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Ecod you be done by them genteelly enough; I be sure that house have brought the country round to ruination. Before this Nabob came here wi' all his money and be domn'd to 'un, every thing were as peaceable and deceant as never was;— not a lawyer within ten miles; now there be three practising in village; and what's ameast as bad, there be three doctors; and the farmers so consated, drive about in their chay carts, eat lump sugar ev'ry day, and gi'balls.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oatld.</speaker>
<p>To be sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>And what's the upshot? why that they jig it away to country jail.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oatld.</speaker>
<p>Tezez vous! Let me see—Great cassino be ten o diamonds. Well then, I play—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Play! ecod, if you go on so, you mun work tho'.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oatld.</speaker>
<p>Next, I must take care of the speads.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>No, Feyther, a spade mun take care o' you; By gol, here be Mr. Heartly, Sir Hubert's steward, now don't you be saucy to un, Feyther;— now do behave thyzelf—now that's a man, Feyther, do.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Clapping him on the back.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> HEARTLY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Heartly.</speaker>
<p>Good day, Farmer Oatland; how dost do, honest Frank?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Desperate pure, thank ye, sur.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heartly.</speaker>
<p>Well, farmer, once more I have called respecting your arrear of rent—Three hundred pound is a long sum.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Three hundred pound.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heartly.</speaker>
<p>And unless it be immediately discharged, Sir Hubert is resolved to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oatld.</speaker>
<p>That for Sir Hubert—He shall have his rent—Frank, send your sister Jessy to the Nabob's, he'll let me have the money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>No! I won't—What business have sister at such a desperate prodigal place. Na, na, I'll go myzelf.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heartly.</speaker>
<p>You are in the right, honest Frank.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sur, I always am.</p>

<p>Ugh! you vulgar mongrel—Well, desire the Nabob's gentleman to desire the Nabob to let me have three hundred pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>He won't gi' thee a brass farthing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oatld.</speaker>
<p>Sir Hubert shall have his money— Ha! ha! ha! my notion is, he wants it sad enough, ha! ha!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Oatld.</speaker>
<p>Silence, you hound! and obey!—Bon jour, Mr. Steward,—I'll to bed—'Pon honor, I must cut champagne, it makes me so narvous —Sir Hubert shall have his money, let that satisfy,—Follow me, cur.</p>

<head>SCENE II—</head><stage><hi>A Room in the Nabob's house</hi></stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ELLEN VORTEX, <hi>meeting</hi> BRONZE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>Good Mr. Bronze, have you been at Sir Hubert Stanley's?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bronze.</speaker>
<p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>Is Charles Stanley arrived?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bronze.</speaker>
<p>No, ma'am; but he is hourly expected.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>Do they say he is well—quite recovered?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bronze.</speaker>
<p>I don't know, ma'am—upon my soul—I beg pardon, but really the Baronet's house is horrid vulgar, compared to your uncle's, the Nabob's here; I peeped thro' my glass into an old hall, and beheld fifty paupers at dinner, such wretches! and the Baronet himself walking round the table to see them properly fed.—How damn'd low!—Ugh! I would bett a rump and dozen our second table is more genteelerer than Sir Hubert's own—but I must away, for we expect the rich Miss Vortex—I beg pardon; but your name and the Nabob's
<pb n="10" facs="9"/>daughter being the same, we call her the rich, to distinguish—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>And you do wisely—no term of distinction cou'd possibly be more significant or better understood by the world, than that you have adopted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bronze.</speaker>
<p>Hope no offence, ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>None, Bronze, go in.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bronze.</speaker>
<p>The last man on earth to offend a fine woman.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>The rich Miss Vortex—most true.—But now my dear Charles Stanley is return'd, I claim the superior title of the Happy. Oh! Charles, when we parted last at Spa; how great the contrast; thy animated form was prison'd in the icy fetters of disease; thy pale and quiv'ring lip refused a last adieu;—But ah! a smile that seemed borrowed from a seraph who waited to bear thee up to Heaven, swore for thee everlasting love. That smile supported me in solitude,—but to solitude I have now bade adieu, and to be near the lord of my heart, have again enter'd this house, the palace of ruinous luxury and licentious madness; but here comes its whimsical proprietor.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mr. VORTEX <hi>with a paper in his hand, attended by black and white servants.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Sublime!—oh, the fame of this speech will spread to Indostan. Eh!—don't I smell the pure air in this room? Oh! you villains! would you destroy me, throw about the perfumes for legislative profundity; for fancy and decoration,—'tis a speech.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>What speech is it, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex</speaker>
<p>Ah! Ellen—why my maiden speech in Parliament—it will alarm all Europe—I'll speak it to you.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>No, my dear uncle, not just now—I hear you've been ill.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Oh! very—a strange agitation at my heart, and such a whizzing and spinning in my head—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>I hope you've had advice?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, I've had them all.—One physician told me it was caused by too brilliant and effervescent a genius;—the next said, it was the scurvy; —a third, it proceeded from not eating pepper to a melon;—another had the impudence to hint it was only little qualms that agitated some gentlemen who had made fortunes in India;—one recommended a sea voyage,—another a flannel night-cap;—one prescrib'd water,—the other brandy; but, however they all agreed in this essential point, that I'm not to be contradicted, but have my way in every thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>An extremely pleasant prescription, certainly. But under these circumstances do you hold it prudent, uncle, to become a parliamentary Orator? I believe a little <hi>gentle</hi> contradiction is usual in that House.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>I know it—but if you will hear my speech, you will see how I manage—I begin —Sir—</p>

<p>The most brilliant house-warming— uncommon full, above a thousand people—every body there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>Pray, cousin, do you then visit every body?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, they must ask me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>Must! I shou'd imagine that wou'd depend on inclination.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Inclination! psha! I beg your pardon; but you are really uncommon ignorant my dear. They must ask me, I tell you.—Now suppose a Dutchess rash enough to shut me from her parties; —very well.—She names a night.—I name the same, and give an entertainment greatly surpassing her's in splendour and profusion.—What is the consequence? —why, that her rooms are as deserted as an Ex-minister's levee, and mine cramm'd to suffocation with her Grace's most puissant and noble friends.—Ha! ha! my dear Ellen, the court of St. James's run after a good supper as eagerly as the court of Aldermen.—Ha! ha! your being in this country, Nabob, was thought quite charming.—A host not being at home to receive his guests is uncommon new and elegant, isn't.—Here we improve, my dear, on ancient hospitality—those little memorandums, Nabob, will give you an idea of the sort of thing.</p>

<p>"March."—Oh! that's a delightful month, when Nature produces nothing, and every thing is forc'd.—Let me see—" 50 quarts of green peas at five guineas a quart,"—that was pretty well:—"500 peaches"—at what?—" a guinea each."—Oh! too cheap.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>'Tis very true; but I assure you I tried every where to get them dearer, but cou'd not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>And I suppose the new white sattin furniture was all spoil'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Oh! entirely—and the pier glasses shivered to pieces so delightfully.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Well, I hope you had the whole account put in the papers?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, else what would have been the use of giving the fete. Then the company; such charming eccentricity, such characters out of character.—We had a noble Peer bowing for custom to his shop, and an Alderman turning over the music leaves for the celebrated Soprano; an Orator's lady detailing her hnsband's three hours speech in Parliament, and the Orator himself describing how puppets are managed at the Fantoccini; we had grandmothers making assignations with boys, and the children of Israel joining the host of Pharaoh.—Oh! my dear Miss Vortex, why don't you partake in these charming scenes?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>My dear Miss Vortex, six suppers would annihilate my fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Oh true, I forgot your uncommon small fortune. But I don't think it much signifies. I swear, people of fashion in town seem to do as well without money, as with it. You might be successful at play. There are points to be learnt, which certainly do not give you the worst of the game. Come, will you be my protegée?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>Excuse me, coussn, I dare say I ought to be covered with blushes, when I own a vulgar detestation of the character of a female gamester, and I must decline the honor of your introduction to the haut ton till at least they have justice on their side.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>An uncommon odd girl, Nabob.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>Heavens! to what state of abject degradation must fashionable society be reduced, when officers of police are as much dreaded by ladies in the purlieus of St. James's, as they are by cut purses in the wretched haunts of St. Giles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>For shame, Ellen, to censure your own sex.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>No, madam, I am its advocate, and in that sex's name protest an abhorrence of those women, who do not consider any thing shameful but to be ashamed of any thing; whose resemblance to nature and innocence exists but in their nakedness, and to whom honour is only known as a pledge at a gaming table.</p>

<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Did you ever hear, Nabob?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>I did not hear a word she said; I was thinking of my speech.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>A pert, Gothic, low-bred creature! But her contemptible fortune suits uncommon well with her grovelling ideas.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Don't talk of her fortune, it always makes my poor head worse. You know at the time I gave her five thousand pounds in lieu of what I called her expectations, I had in my hands an enormous sum of her's. O dear! I'm afraid the doctor was right—ah! mine are certainly East India qualms—I wonder if giving her fifty thousand back again wou'd do my heart any good.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>What! my dear Nabob? I declare you quite shock me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Oh conscience!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Conscience! he! he! a thing so uncommon vulgar, a thing so completely chausseed; besides, yon know very well it is absolutely impossible to exist under 20,000l. a-year.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>That's very true.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Some people certainly do contrive to grub on with ten thousand, but how they do it is to me miraculous; then think of your intention of marrying me to the son of your great rival the baronet; think of his borough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Ah! very true.—Conscience avaunt; I have made a motion on matrimony to Sir Hubert.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>And young Stanley's arrival; Oh! what a sweet youth!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Oh! what a sweet borough interest! But I am glad your heart is interested.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Heart interested! Lud, how can you suspect me of so uncommon vulgar a sensation. I trust my joy is occasioned by ideas more becoming a woman of fashion.—I am charm'd because his fortune is large, his family ancient; and because my marriage will render all my female friends so uncommon miserable; and because I suspect that Ellen met young Stanley at Spa, and that she dares aspire to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>To say truth, Sir Hubert, the castle has been all day in quarrel, each servant claiming the right of exclusive attendance on his dear young master.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Heart.</speaker>
<p>Aye, and it revives my old heart.</p>

<p>Nothing but what profligacy and insolence dictated—he desied your power, and sent to the Nabob.</p>

<p>Ungrateful man! let a distres be issued. —Hold; no, no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heart.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir Hubert, he is undeserving your lenity.—Besides, sir, your mortgagee, Mr. Rapid, the wealthy taylor, will be here to-day— the interest on the mortgage must be paid—some of your election bills remain unliquidated, and I fear without a surther mortgage—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Don't torture. Pardon me, good old man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heart.</speaker>
<p>Truly, Sir Hubert, what might have been effected with 5000<hi>l,</hi> some years ago, will now require ten—you must retrench your hospitable benevolence.</p>

<p>My worthy steward, my head has long acknowledg'd the truth of your arithmetic—but my head could never teach it to my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heart.</speaker>
<p>And, sir, you may raise your rents.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Never, Heartley.—never.—What! shall the many suffer that I may be at ease!—But away with care—this is a moment devoted to extasy —this is the hour a doating father is to clasp an only child, who, after combating with disease and death, returns triumphant to his arms in lusty health and manhood.—Ah! he approaches; 'tis my boy—Dost thou not see him in the beechen avenue. —Dull old man, advance thine hand thus,— <stage>(putting his hand over his forehead)</stage>—See how his eyes wander with delight, and renovate the pictures of his youth.—Ah! now he sees his father, and sties like lightning.</p>

<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>My honour'd—my lov'd father!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Rise to my heart.—Stand off, and let my eyes gloat upon thee—thou art well—Thy arm,
<pb n="17" facs="16"/>good Heartley.—Nay, do not weep, old Honesty, 'twill infect me.</p>

<p>Ah! my excellent old friend—in health I hope?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heart.</speaker>
<p>Aye, good master, and this day will make me young again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>Dear father, already must I become a suitor to you.—Passing Oatland farm, I found his lovely daughter Jessy in tears, occasion'd by her father's inability to pay his rent. I dried them with a promise— <stage>(Heartley shakes his head, and Sir Hubert averts his face).</stage>—Ha! your brow is clouded with unhappiness;—pray, sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Good Heartley, leave us— <stage><hi>(Exeunt</hi> HEARTLEY <hi>and</hi> Servants.)</stage>—Charles, so mix'd is the cup of life, that this day, the happiest thy old father can e'er hope to see, is dash'd with bitterness and sorrow, boy. I've been a very unthrift to thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>Oh, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Listen to me.—You have heard how my father kept alive the benevolent hospitality that once distinguish'd old England, and I not finding in modern ethics aught likely to improve either the morals or happiness of mankind, determin'd to persevere in the ways of my fathers. Soon after you went abroad the adjoining estate was purchased by an East Indian, groaning under wealth produc'd by groans. Like the viper, after collecting in the warm sunshine his bag of venom, he came to the abode of peace and innocence, and disseminated his poison. But mark me—think me not so unjust, boy, as with random slander to censure any body of men. No, thank heaven; there are numbers whom Providence, in addition to the power, has added the will, to render wealth a blessing to all around them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>You are ever just and liberal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>But for this vile exception, this Mr. Vortex, I tell thee, riot, contention, indolence, and vice succeeded. I struggled against this mischies, which spurr'd him on to oppose me in my election. This contest (I trust, Charlea, you think
<pb n="18" facs="17"/>the dignity of your family demanded it)—this contest, I say, obliged me to mortgage my estate to a considerable amount; and I fear, boy, even that will not suffice.—Dost thou not blame thy father?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>Blame, sir? my fortune, nay, my life is held but to promote your happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Glorious boy! then all will be well again—thy estate restor'd, thy wealth enlarg'd</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>By marriage, Charles.—</p>
<stage>(Charles averts his face with dejection.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>Marriage, sir!—To conceal the passion that triumphs here were but to deceive a father, and injure the bright excellence I love. When I was ill at Spa, the votaries of pleasure avoided me as the harbinger of melancholy, and I was despis'd as a thing passing into oblivion by all but one fair creature. I obtain'd an opportunity to thank her for the charitable pity her eye had beam'd on me. Love soon kindled his torch at Pity's altar, for I found in Miss Vortex such excellence—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Who?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>Miss Vortex, sir.</p>

<p>Oh! let me haste to her.—Yet hold! Frank Oatland attends to hear your determination.</p>

<p>At present, Charles, I cannot grant your suit.— <stage>(CHARLES <hi>beckons in</hi> FRANK)</stage>—Young man, tell your father the law must take its course. When I see in him symptoms of contrition and amendmert, I may restore him.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Ect, sur, we went through our letters— and a-b, ab—c-b, eb—there somehow I stuck, and 'Squire went clean away into abreviation and abcmination; and then I never cou'd take much to your pens, they be so cruel small; now a pitchfork do fit my hand so desperate kindly as never was.</p>

<p>That's right—sir—short—you're a fine fellow.</p>

<p>Yes, sar.</p>

<p>Yes, sar.</p>

<p>How far?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>Three miles.</p>

<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Which way?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>West.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>That will do—get me a buggy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Oh, if my old dad had left off business as some of your flashy taylors to, I might have kept a curricle, and liv'd like a man. Is the buggy ready?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>No, sar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>But to cut the shop with paltry five thousand.—Is the buggy ready?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>No, sar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Or to have dashed to Jessy in a curricle. —Is the buggy ready?</p>

"Sir Hubert Stanley will expect to see Mr. Rapid at the Castle, and wou'd be glad to extend the mortgage, which is now 50,000l." What's this? <stage>(Reads again)</stage>—"Extend the mortgage, "which is now 50,000l to seventy." Fifty thousand! huzza!

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps you wou'd prefer a chaise and pair?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>No, I'll have a chaise and twelve. Abscond! <stage>(<hi>Exit</hi> Waiter.)</stage> I must—I must keep moving.—I must travel for improvement. First I'll see the whole of my native country, its agriculture and manufactories. That, I think, will take me full four days and a half. Next I'll make the tour of Europe; which, to do properly, will I dare say, employ three weeks or a month. Then, returning as completely vers'd in foreign manners and languages as the best of them, I'll make a push at high life. In the first circles I'll keep moving. Fifty thousand! perhaps more—perhaps—ho!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Bronze! how do you do, Bronze? Any thing to say, Bronze? Keep moving. Do you know, Bronze, by this letter I have discover'd that my father is worth—how much, think you?</p>

<p>No, not always <stage>(shrugging)</stage>. But how much?</p>

<p>No; you have multiplied it famously. It's my business to reduce it <stage>(aside)</stage>. Now, my dear dad, in the first place never call me Neddy.</p>

<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Stanley, hear me. On my return to England, Mr. Vortex, to whom the care of my property was entrusted, was ever pressing on my mind the difficulty of recovering my father's India possessions. Each messenger that arrived from you, confirmed the melancholy tale, that my Stanley was sinking into an early grave. Oh! what then was fortune or the world to me? I sought out solitude, and willingly assigned to Mr. Vortex what he called my expectations, for five thousand pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>Yet you shall be mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>No, Charles, I will not bring you poverty. I'll return to solitude, and endeavour to teach this lesson to my heart, "That it will be joy enough to know that Stanley is well and happy."</p>
<stage>(Going).</stage>

<p>Any thing new in high life?—what is the present rage with ladies of fashion?</p>

<p>Why, sir, as to the ladies;— <stage>(<hi>aside</hi>)</stage> What shall I say?—Oh, the ladies, sir—why, heaven bless them, sir! they—they keep moving;—but, to confess the truth sir,—my fashionable education has been very much neglected.</p>

<p>That's a pity.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>No, madam, neglected wild flowers—I took them from their bed of weeds, bestowed care on their culture, and, by transplanting them to a more genial soil, they have flourished with luxuriant strength and beauty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>A pretty amusement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>And it seems, madam, to convey this lesson —Not to despise the lowly mind, but rather with fostering hand, to draw it from its chill obscurity, that, like these humble flowers, it might grow rich in worth and native energy.</p>

<p>Yes, sir; but I declare I forgot the dimensions of this room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Sir, if you please, I'll measure it—my cane is exactly a yard, good honest measure—'tis handy—and that mark is the half yard, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap. </speaker>
<stage>(Overhears, and snatches the cane from him.)</stage>

<p>At it again!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>As a needle—</p>

<speaker>Y. Rap. </speaker>

<p>Now to sound them.—I hear, gentlemen, your business in this part of the country is with Sir Hubert Stanley, respecting some money transactions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a secret, sir.</p>
</sp>

<p>Oh! no—the Baronet avows his wish to sell-his estate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Oh! that alters the case.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>I think it would be a desirable purchase for you—I should be happy in such neighbours— and if you should want forty or fifty thousand, ready money, I'll supply it with pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, how kind!—If my son wishes to purchase, I would rather leave it entirely to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>And I would rather leave it entirely to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Very well, I'll propose for it.— <stage>(aside).</stage> This will cut Sir Hubert to the soul.—There is a very desirable borough interest—then you could sit in Parliament.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>I in Parliament? ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>No; that would be a botch.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>No, no, I was once in the gallery— cramm'd in—no moving—expected to hear the great guns—up got a little fellow, nobody knew who, gave us a three hours' speech—I got dev'lish fidgetty—the House called for the question, I join'd the cry—"The question, the question," says I.—A Member spied me—clear'd the gallery —got hustl'd by my brother spectators—obliged to scud—Oh! it would never do for me.</p>

<p>Excuse me, dear Sir <stage>(<hi>takes the letter and reads).</hi></stage>Mr. Vortex, at the request of Mr. Rapid, informs Sir Hubert Stanley, it is inconvement for him to advance more money on mortgage. Mr. Vortex laments Sir Hubert's pecuniary embarrassments—damnation!— to relieve which, he will purchase the castle and estate.—Sooner shall its massy ruins crumble me to dust.—Don't despond, my father:—bear up!</p>

<p>Hush!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>What's his business?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>Oh, sir! <stage>(<hi>concealing his agitation</hi>)</stage>—My friend Frank consults me on a love assair; and I must not betray his considence.—In his hurry he sell.—Wasn't it so</p>
<stage>(<hi>significantly)?</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>You are not hurt, young man?</p>

<p>No, fur.—Thank heaven! my head be a pure hard one.</p>

<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>Within!— <stage>(<hi>Enter two</hi> Servants)</stage> Attend my Father.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>My boy, don't stay from me long.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit, leaning on</hi> Servants.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>Now, good Frank, ease my tortur'd mind.—What of my father?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>Why, your honour, Mr. Bronze came laughing out of dining-room, and says, "Daame, how the old Baronet has been roasted." So, fur, I not knowing what they could mean by roasting a Christian, axed. "Why," says he, grinning. "they voted, that it was a pity the dignity of the bloody hand interfer'd, or the old beggar might set up a shop."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>What!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>The old beggar might set up a shop.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>Unmanner'd, cowardly babblers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>And that you, fur, would make a dapper 'prentice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>I heed not that.—But, when I forgive a father's wrongs—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frank.</speaker>
<p>So says I, Domme, if young 'squire had been among them, he would have knocked all their heads together. Now wouldn't you, fur, have knock'd their heads together? Then they all laugh'd at me: which somehow made all the blood in my body come into my knuckles. So says I, "Mr. Bronze, suppose a case—suppose me young 'squire Stanley—now, say that again about his honour'd father."—So he did; and I lent him such a drive o'the feace—and I was knocking all their heads together pretty tightish—till the cook laid me flat wi' the poker: then they all fell upon me; and when I could sight no longer, I fell a crying, and run to tell your honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charles.</speaker>
<p>Thanks, my affectionate lad!—Return to the Nabob's to-day.</p>

<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Dear me!—here's a terrible affair! <stage>(<hi>reads</hi>)</stage>Give me up the author of the slander on my father that was myself—I never can find in my heart to give myself up— or personally answer the consequences—CHARLES STANLEY.—Oh dear! since I sind my words are taken down, I must be more parliamentary in my language—What shall I do?—I can't sight—my poor head won't bear it —it might be the death of me.</p>

<stage>(without.)</stage>
<p>Huzza, my fine fellows! Bravo!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Eh! egad, a fine thought—Young Rapid is loaded muzzel high with Champaigne— I'll tell him he said the words, and make him own them. I've persuaded him into a marriage with
<pb n="51" facs="52"/>my daughter; after that, the devil's in't if I can't persuade him into a duel.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> YOUNG RAPID (<hi>tipsey).</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Here I am, tip-top spirits—ripe for any thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>How did you like my Champaigne?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Oh! suits me exactly; a man is such a damn'd long while getting tipsy with other wine —Champaigne fettles the business directly—it has made me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Lively, I see.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Lively—it has made me like a skyrocket. Well, how did I behave?—Quite easy, wasn't I?—Push'd on—at every thing—barr'd prosing.—Jolly dogs within—the fat parson's a fine fellow—kept the bottle moving—said a nice short grace.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Well, and did you lose at play the five hundred pounds I let you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>As easy as could be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>That was lucky.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Very—particularly for those who won it.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Well, now you'll do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Huzza! I'm a finish'd man</p>
<stage>(staggering, and strutting about).</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>You only want a quarrel to make you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>A what?—A quarrel—Damme, I'll settle that in two minutes</p>
<stage>(running off).</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Stop.—You need not go out of the room for that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>What! will you quarrel with me, eh? —With all my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Me! Oh no!—I say I could get you such same—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>How, my dear fellow?—Dash on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Why, at dinner you reflected on the Baronet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>No, it was you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>No, not I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Yes, it was you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="52" facs="53"/>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Well, it might be I; but I don't say it was—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>I. do.—Push on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Young Stanley has demanded the author.— Now, if you were to own the words—how the news-papers would teem with—"The elegant Charles Stanley was called out by the dashing: Young Rapid about some trifle"—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Bravo!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Any thing does for a duel now a-days— the length of a dancer's great toe—an election leg of mutton and trimmings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Say no more—I'll do it. By heavens, no man of fashion will be more infamous—I mean more famous.—I'll go write to him directly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>First take another bottle of Champaigne. You can't think what a free dashing stile it will give you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>I will <stage>(<hi>going—returns.</hi>)</stage> No, I can't take up this quarrel.</p>

<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear!—Why not?</p>
<stage>(<hi>alarmed).</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Because I'm sure I'm depriving you of a pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Oh, don't mind me! I give it you, to shew my regard for you.—Indeed, I've had so much fighting in my time, that with me it really ceases to be a pleasure—the sweetest things will cloy—so the quarrel's your's—I wash my hands of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>You're a damn'd good hearted, generous fellow!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Then you'll return triumphant, and marry my daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>To be sure—keep moving <stage>(<hi>going).</hi></stage> I hope he'll fight directly.—Like a sailor, I hate a calm, particularly when an enemy's in fight.— Hold—what must we sight with? I can fence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>You have no objection to pistols and bullets?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Y. Rap.</speaker>
<p>I like bullets—they come so quick. But I must push on—the other bottle, and then— I'm a first-rats fellow.—Champaigne for ever!</p>

<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>You shall have my pistols—hey've never been used. <stage>(<hi>Enter</hi> Miss VORTEX.)</stage> Here's policy. "Crown me, shadow me, wich laurels."—Oh my dear, I've atchiev'd two such difficult points!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>How, my dear Nabob?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>In the first place, I've persuaded Young Rapid to marry you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Was that so difficult?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>No, no, certainly. But the next will delight you.—Rapid is going to have an affair of honour with Young Stanley.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>A duel! and about me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Yes.— <stage>(<hi>aside</hi>)</stage> I may as well tell her so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Charming!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Now an't I a kind father, to set two young men fighting about you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Ah! that is, indeed, acting like a parent!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>Egad, I must look after Rapid, though.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>But how did you manage it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vortex.</speaker>
<p>By policy, to be sure: for, as I observe in my speech—"Policy is—"</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Certainly. A duel is going to be fought about me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>A duel! Horrible thought!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>Sensibility, I now! Too comic, a vast deal! Ha! ha! cottage pathos must proceed from a source unknown to me, I'm sure!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>It proceeds, madam, from the heart.</p>

<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>I beg your pardon—I forgot the extent of a servant's duty.—I forgot that servants have no right to feel pleasure or pain, but as their employers please; and that suppressing the sensibilities of Nature is consider'd in their wages</p>
<stage>(<hi>sarcastically).</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>No doubt of it.—That's so very sensibly observ'd, that I'll forgive you, Oatland.— The pride of young Stanley will be so humbled—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Is the safety of that noble youth implicated?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Vor.</speaker>
<p>What!—A lover, I suppose—came to the farm, I warrant—attended Miss Jessy in the dairy—ruffled the cream with his sighs—talked of Arcadia, and sipped butter-milk.—Ha! ha! I should not wonder, after what I have seen of his taste—Yes, he is implicated—I dare say Mr. Rapid will—</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Sir HUBERT STANLEY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>What can it mean?—Charles parted from me in an agony the ingenuousness of his nature had not art to conceal;—he grasp'd my hand,— bade me farewell, as if it were for ever,—then broke away—leaving me a prey to wild conjecture and despait;—soon shall I be at peace.—infirmity, when goaded on by sorrow, presses to the goal of life with double speed—Surely thro' that laurel grove, I see two female figures glide along; my eyes are not of the best, and the sorrow I have felt for my dear boy has not strengthened them; —they approach—</p>

<p>Madam, I welcome you as my daughter.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Ah! What of him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>I saw him pass along, he sled from my

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Ha! <stage>(<hi>draws his sword and is running out, staggers, drops his sword.</hi>—ELLEN <hi>and</hi> JESSY <hi>support him</hi>)</stage> My functions are suspended!—Oh nature! dost thou desert me at this moment?—Who is the villain that has caused it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my poor Edward!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Oh that I could rush before my child, and receive the fatal ball in this old broken heart!— Perhaps—dreadful thought!—e'en now the deadly tube is levelled at his manly breast. <stage>(<hi>The report of a pistol is heard</hi>—ELLEN <hi>sinks into his arms.</hi>)</stage> Bear up, I cannot support thee. <stage>(<hi>Another pistol is discharged</hi>)</stage>—Horrible suspense!—what a death-like silence!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>So, Mr. Rapid!—How happened this, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Really, Sir Hubert, I don't understand the cut of it; all I can say is, your son's behaviour
<pb n="59" facs="60"/>was—oh—supersine;—when they had fired their pistols they drew out their swords, and your son disarm'd Neddy, and then he generously gave him his sword again, which was extremely genteel,— for it was a brand new silver-hilted sword, and, I suppose by the laws of honour he might have kept it.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Rapid, why did you break your appointment?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Vortex, sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Vortex.—I fear your son has selected an imprudent preceptor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Chose a bad pattern you think, sir?— I am afraid he has—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Hub.</speaker>
<p>Will you, sir, favour me with a few minutes conversation?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>You know, Sir Hubert, I'm your faithful servant to command.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Sir Hub.</hi> </speaker>
<stage>(<hi>to</hi> ELLEN.)</stage>
<p>Come, let us to our hero. Will you, fair creature, condescend to be a crutch to an old man? <stage>(<hi>takes</hi> ELLEN'S <hi>arm.</hi>)</stage> I shall expect you, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ellen.</speaker>
<p>Jessy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>I follow, madam. <stage>(<hi>Exeunt</hi> Sir HUBERT <hi>and</hi> ELLEN.)</stage> Do I address the father of Mr. Rapid?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>You do, pretty one!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy. </speaker>
<stage>(taking his hand and kissing it.)</stage>
<p>I beg your pardon; but are you sure your son's life is safe —quite safe?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Yes.—A very charming girl, I declare! —I'm very much obliged to you for taking notice of my Neddy!—Poor fellow!—nobody seem'd to care what became of him.—I'm very much oblig'd.—A sweet pretty-spoken creature as ever I saw! But I must away to the Nabob's, or I shall be too late for the wedding.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Wedding! whose, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Whose! why, my boy Neddy's with Miss Vortex, to be sure!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Married! Edward married! 'Tis too much—</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="60" facs="61"/>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Edward! is this the return for my love? have I merited this cruel desertion?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>Desertion!—What!—has the rascal—I shall choak myself—Has he behaved ill to so sweet a creature? Your tears tell me so—I'll kill him.—He's my own son, and I have a right to do it—Your name, your name! pretty soul!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Jessy Oatland.—The indiscretion of my father has made me a servant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>And the discretion of his father has made him a gentleman—But I'll make the rascal know you are not humbled by your Father's conduct, nor is he exalted by his, a villain!—Can he hope to be call'd a man of honour for opposing his head to a pistol, while himself levels the shaft of anguish at an innocent woman's heart?—But I'll kill him, that's one comfort.—Come with me, sweet one!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jessy.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I must attend my mistress—I am servant to his bride—</p>
<stage>(<hi>weeps).</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O. Rap.</speaker>
<p>I shall go mad!—Don't cry—If he, by marriage, won't make you my daughter— I, by adoption, will.—Good bye, sweet Jessy! —Oh, the rascal!—Cheer up?—the scoundrel! —Pretty creature!—The dog!—What a shape!—I'll kill him!</p>

<p>I have just seen a lovely girl that you have wrong'd.</p>

<p>I know I have; and I'll fight you again, if you like it.</p>

<p>The fact is, I am the most unhappy—the —What do you charge for shooting a man? I'll give you a thousand to blow my brains out. I'm the most miserable dog—Pray, sir, will you tell me one thing?—Are you a man of fashion?</p>

<p>I trust I'm a gentleman.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Rap.</speaker>
<p>That's pretty much the same thing—an't it, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stanley.</speaker>
<p>It ought to be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rap.</speaker>
<p>Pray, sir, how did you become a gentleman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stanley.</speaker>
<p>Simply, by never committing an action that would not bear reflection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rap.</speaker>
<p>Can I be a gentleman and an honest man?</p>

<p>I, possessing the heart of my dear Ellen, am miserable: because on account of the narrowness of her fortune, she compels me to abandon her.</p>

<p>No, you are not!—I'll show you such a scene.—Nay, don't ask me any questions—follow me, that's all.—Wait at the door; and when I cry, Hem! come in. But don't be in such a hurry. By heavens, the pain in my side is better already! Huzza!—Come along! <stage>(Going, returns, and runs to the glass and nods.)</stage> How do you do? How do you do?

<sp>
<lg>
<l>SHAKESPEARE, a shrewd old quiz, in his dull age,</l>
<l>Said, very gravely, "All the world's a stage."</l>
<l>But if the Poet on our times could drop,</l>
<l>He'd rather own that <hi>"all the world's a shop."</hi></l>
<l>"And what's the trade?" exclaim the critic railers</l>
<l>Why, "Men and women all are merely taylors."</l>
<l>Nay, frown not, Beaux; and Ladies, do not pout</l>
<l>You've all your <hi>cuttings in</hi> and <hi>cuttings out.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And, first, Miss Hoyden, just escap'd from school</l>
<l>Slighting mamma, and all domestic rule;</l>
<l>If she on fashion's road should chance to trip,</l>
<l>What says the world? why, "Miss has made a slip.</l>
<l>And if, a falling character to save,</l>
<l>She weds with age just tott'ring o'er the grave,</l>
<l>The sportive world will still enjoy the joke,</l>
<l>And spouse, at home, at once is made a cloke.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The Politician too, who when <hi>in</hi> place,</l>
<l>Views public measures with a smiling sace,</l>
<l>Croaks, when he's <hi>out,</hi> a discontented note,—</l>
<l>Sure he's a taylor—he has turn'd his coat.</l>
<l>Oft have I measur'd you when closely sitting,</l>
<l>To see what twist, what shape, what air was sitting.</l>
<l>Once more I'll try, if you'll make no resistance;</l>
<l>Mine's a quick eye, and measures at a distance.</l>
</lg>
<stage>Produces the sheers and measure.</stage>
<lg>
<l>Great Mr. Alderman—your worship—sir,</l>
<l>If you can stomach it, you need not stir,</l>
<l>Room you require, for turtle and for haunch,</l>
<l>'Tis done—two yards three quartersround the paunch.</l>
<l>Slim sir, hold up your arm—Oh, you're a Poet,</l>
<l>You want a coat, indeed—your elbows show it.</l>
<l>Don't tremble, man; there's now no cause for fears,</l>
<l>Though oft you shirk the Gemmen of the sheers;</l>
<l>Genius stands still, when taylors interpose,</l>
<l>'Tis like a watch—it ticks—and then it goes.</l>

<l>The needle dropt, the warlike sword I draw,</l>

<l>"They've drawn me for a man; and, what is worse,</l>
<l>"I am to soldier it, and mount a horse:</l>

<l>"But that your La'ship's heart may cease from throbbing,</l>
<l>"Let your fat Coachman mount upon fat Dobbin;</l>
<l>"And for the good old pair I'll boldly say,</l>
<l>"Nor man, nor horse, will ever run away."</l>

<l>"The Frenchmen came expecting us to meet 'em,</l>

<l>"And, by my soul, such dainty fine fat frogs,</l>
<l>"With warm dry lodging for them in the bogs."</l>
<l>"They came, alas!" cried I, of terror full.</l>
<l>"They made a conquest?"—"No, they made a bull."</l>
<l>But softly—what with measures, bulls, and battle,</l>
<l>You must be tir'd with my poor foolish prattle;</l>
<l>But while you look so pleasant, kind and clever,</l>
