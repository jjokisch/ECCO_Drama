<p>THE SCHOOL for ARROGANCE: A <hi>COMEDY.</hi></p>
<p>AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, COVENT GARDEN.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>THE Comedy of <hi>Le Glorieux,</hi> by M. Nericault Destouches, is the basis on which <hi>The School for Arrogance</hi> has been formed. From that I have taken the plan, several of the characters, and some of the scenes. Difference of arrangement, additional incidents, and what I deem to be essential changes of character, have all been introduced. The Count has but little resemblance to the original: Lucy and Mac Dermot none. Lady Peckham is a new character, and was first suggested by a friend; who, conceiving highly of the contrast which exists in life, between the pride of rank and the pride of riches, industriously sought to stimulate and rouse my imagination.</p>
<p>The subject of the piece is greatly interesting to morals, and highly worthy of the Theatre. Conscious of the great effects a perfect Comedy might have produced, I regret the imperfections of the present. Some good it will do: I regret that it cannot do more. Persuaded as I am of the moral
<pb n="ii" facs="4"/>
dignity of the stage, I cherish an enthusiastic wish to see the dramatic art surpass even all its former sublime efforts. Among the pleasures of the imagination, how frequently has its place been the first! Happy indeed should I be, could my success add the smallest impulse to the exertions of Genius: ineffably happy, would but this noble art once more boldly assert its rank; and render itself, not only the general love and delight of mankind, but the veneration of the wise.</p>
<p>It is with peculiar pleasure that I here acknowledge how much I am indebted to the conduct of Mr. Marshal; who, in consequence of the prejudices which it was imagined Mr. Harris laboured under, respecting me, acted, for a time, in my behalf, as the author of the piece. Though anxiously zealous for its success, he still continued impartially attentive to the interests of all parties; and sacrificed his own feelings to promote what he conceived to be a public good.</p>
<p>The tribute of justice is also due to Mr. Harris. This tribute I am happy to have an opportunity to pay. And, that I may
<pb n="iii" facs="5"/>
now be consistent, as I always have been, in my private and public language to Mr. Harris, I will here insert a copy of a letter which I wrote to him, when the comedy had been twice performed.</p>

<opener><salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I HAVE patiently waited the proper moment in which to write to you. That moment I hope is now come. I should be guilty of injustice, were I any longer to delay expressing my sense of the propriety with which you have acted, relatively to The School for Arrogance, after you had every reason to suppose it mine. Such conduct, Sir, is highly honourable; and is not only productive of the best effects, but must secure the best and most permanent applause. That you had conceived disadvantageous ideas of me I knew; though I have no doubt but I shall ultimately convince you that, even supposing me to be mistaken, my motives have been laudable ***** <note n="†" place="foot">A single phrase, which relates entirely to myself, is here omitted.</note>. With me you were
<pb n="iv" facs="6"/>
irritated; but you had the justice to forget the man, and promote the interests of the piece. This I hold it my duty to say to the world at large.</p>
<closer><salute>I am, Sir, Your obliged humble servant,</salute>

<opener><salute>To THOMAS HARRIS, Esq.</salute></opener>
<p>Mr. Harris kindly expressed the satisfaction which his own private feelings received, from this letter; nor can there be a doubt but that the propriety of his conduct, under such circumstances, will be as agreeable to himself, and as pleasing to the public, as it has been to me.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. BERNARD, in the character of a News-hawker.</byline>
<stage>After sounding and calling "Great news!" without, enter with a postman's horn, newspapers, cap, and livery.</stage>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>GREAT news! Great news! Extraordinary news!</l>
<l>Who'll buy, or give three half-pence to peruse?</l>
<l><stage>(Sounds)</stage> Great news!—Pray did you call, Sirs? Here am I!</l>
<l>Of wants and wanted I've a large supply!</l>
<l>Of fire and murder, marriage, birth and death,</l>
<l>Here's more than I can utter in a breath!</l>
<l>Rapes, riots, hurricanes, routs, rogues, and faro!</l>
<l>Famine and flames in Turkey, and the plague at Cairo!</l>
<l>Here's tincture for the gums, which dentists make;</l>
<l>Whose teeth eat most when other people's ache.</l>
<l>Here are rich soups, hams, tongues, oils, sauce, sour krout:</l>
<l>And here's the grand specific for the gout!</l>
<l>Here's turtle newly landed; lamb house-fed:</l>
<l>And here a wife and five small children wanting bread.</l>
<l>Wholesale and retail British spirits here:</l>
<l>And here's the dying speech of poor small-beer!</l>
<l>Here are tall men, short women, and fat oxen:</l>
<l>And here are Sunday schools, and schools for boxing;</l>
<l><pb n="i" facs="8"/>
Here ruin'd rakes for helpmates advertise;</l>
<l>And only want 'em handsome, rich, and wise.</l>
<l>Great news! Here's money lent on bond, rare news!</l>
<l>By honest, tender-hearted, christian Jews!</l>
<l>Here are promotions, dividends, rewards;</l>
<l>A list of bankrupts, and of new-made lords.</l>
<l>Here the debates at length are, for the week:</l>
<l>And here the deaf and dumb are taught to speak.</l>
<l>Here Hazard, Goodluck, Shergold, and a band</l>
<l>Of gen'rous gentlemen, whose hearts expand</l>
<l>With honour, rectitude, and public spirit,</l>
<l>Equal in high desert, with equal merit,</l>
<l>Divide their tickets into shares, and quarters:</l>
<l>And here's a servant-maid found hanging in her garters!</l>
<l>Here! Here's the fifty thousand, sold at ev'ry shop!</l>
<l>And here's the Newgate calendar—and drop.</l>
<l>Rare news! Strange news! Extraordinary news!</l>
<l>Who would not give three-halfpence to peruse?</l>
</lg>
<stage>(Going, returns)</stage>
<lg>
<l>'Sblues! I forgot—Great news, again, I say!</l>
<l>To-night, at Covent Garden, a new play!</l>
<l><stage>(In raptures)</stage> Oh! I'll be there! With Jack, our printer's devil!</l>
<l>We're judges, we! Know when to clap, or cavil!</l>
<l>We've heard our pressmen talk of, of—of Rome and Greece!</l>
<l>And have read Harry-Harry-Harry Stotle's master piece!</l>
<l>When we have paid our shilling, we're the town!</l>
<l>As wisely can find fault as those who pay their crown!</l>
<l>Nay we, like them, if it be bad or good,</l>
<l>Can talk, as fast as, as—as if we understood!</l>
<l><pb n="vii" facs="9"/>
Oh! I'll be there; get the first row; and, with my staff,</l>
<l>I'll act the trunk-maker, thump, roar, encore, and laugh!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The prompter's boy has call'd our Jack aside;</l>
<l>And says the Play's to cure the world of pride!</l>
<l>That rich folks will no longer think they're born</l>
<l>To crush the weak, and laugh the poor to scorn!</l>
<l>The great 'twill teach that virtue, wit, and merit,</l>
<l>They may perchance possess, but can't inherit!</l>
<l>That learning, wisdom, genius, truth, and worth,</l>
<l>Are far more rich and rare than ribbands, rank, and birth!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Lord! Lord! Whoever heard of such a scheme?</l>
<l>Teach sense to wealth and pride! Your poets always dream!</l>
<l>Could he do this, there's no one will deny</l>
<l>That News! Strange news! would be the gen'ral cry.</l>

<speaker>LYDIA.</speaker>
<p>ONCE again, Mr. Mac Dermot, have done with this nonsense.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>Arrah, and why so scoffish? Sure now a little bit of making love—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! Do me the favour to answer my questions. The Count, your master, is in love with Miss Lucy Peckham?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>Faith, and you may say that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Is he really well born?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>Oh! As for that, honey, let him alone. The noblest blood of France, aye, and what is better, of Ireland too, trickles to his finger's ends. The Villars and the O'Connollies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>And he wishes to marry into the family of the Peckhams?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>The divle a bit, my dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>He is viry willing to marry the young Lady, but not her family. His pride and his passion have had many a tough battle about that, d'ye see. Only think! A direct descindant of the former kings of Ireland, and collateral cousin to a prisent peer of France, to besmear and besmoulder his dignity by rubbing it against porter butts, vinegar casks, and beer barrels.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Miss Lucy is indeed a lovely girl, animated to excess, and sometimes apparently giddy and flighty: but she has an excellent understanding, and a noble heart; and these are superior to birth, which is indeed a thing of mere accident.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>Faith, and that it is—I, a simple Irishman, as I am—why now, I would have been born a duke, had they been civil enough to have asked my consint.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>The Count fell in love with her at the convent, to which she was sent to improve her French.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>And where I think you first met with her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Yes—she saw me friendless, and conceived a generous and disinterested affection
<pb n="3" facs="13"/>
for me.—He has followed her to England; has taken apartments in our neighbourhood, and lives in splendour—yet is not rich.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>Um, um.—No—But then he is a Colonel in the Irish brigade; and, beside his pay, has sacrit supplies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>From whom?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>Faith, and I don't believe he knows that himself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>That's strange!—His pride is excessive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>To spake the truth, that now is his failing.—An if it was not for that, oh! he would be the jewel of a master!—He trates his infariors with contimpt, keeps his distance with his aquals, and values the rubbishing dust of his great grandfathers above diamonds!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>His character is in perfect contrast to that of his humble rival, Sir Samuel Sheepy; who, even when he addresses a footman, is all bows and affability; whose chief discourse is, Yes, if you please, and, No, thank you; and who, in the company of his mistress, stammers, blunders, and blushes, like a great boy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>What is it you till me? He the rival of the Count my master! That old—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>A bachelor, and only fifty; rich, of a good family, and a great favourite with Lady Peckham, by never having the courage to contradict her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>Why, there now! You talk of the Count's pride! Here is this city lady as proud as ten counts! Her own coach horses, ready harnessed, don't carry their heads higher! And then she is as insolent, and as vulgar, and—Hem!</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ah! My sweet dear Liddy! You are the angel I wished first to meet! Come to my— <stage>(Running up to her.)</stage>—Why how now, hussey? Why so shy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Reserve your transports, Sir, for Lady Peckham.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Lady!—But who have we here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Mac Dermot, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh! I remember—servant to the Count, my intended son-in-law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>The viry same, Sir. <stage>[Bows.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>I hear an excellent character of your master. They tell me he is a fine, hearty, dauntless, swaggering fellow! If so, he is a man of family, and the very husband for my Lucy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>Faith, thin, and he is all that!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>As for this Sir Samuel Sheepy, he shall decamp—A water drinker! A bowing, scraping, simpering, ceremonious Sir! Never contradicts any body!—Dammee! An old bachelor! And he! He have the impudence to make love to my fine, young, spirited wench!—But he is my Lady's choice!—Is she within?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>I suppose we shall have a fine breeze on this subject! But, what! Am I not the monarch, the Grand Seignior of this house? Am I not absolute? Shall I not dispose of my daughter as I please? Do you hear, young man? Go, present my compliments to the Count, and tell him I mean to give him a call this morning.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Lydia makes signs to Mac Dermot to stay.]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>I am waiting for him here, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Waiting for him here, Sir! No, Sir! You cannot wait for him here, Sir!</p>

<pb n="8" facs="18"/>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>But, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>And, Sir! Why don't you go?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>The Count bid me, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>And I bid you, Sir—Pack! Begone! <stage>[Exit Mac Dermot.]</stage>—Now we're alone, my dear Lydia—Why, where are you going, hussey?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Didn't you hear my Lady call?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Call? No.—And if she did, let her call.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Surely, Sir, you would not have me offend her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Offend! Let me see who dare be offended with you in this house! It is my will that you should be the Sultana!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Me, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>You, my Queen of Hearts! You! My house, my wealth, my servants, myself, all are yours!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>You talk unintelligibly, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Do I? Why then I'll speak plainer.—I am in love with you! You are a delicious creature, and I am determined to make your fortune!—I'll take you a house up in Mary-lebone; a neat snug box; hire you servants, keep you a carriage, buy you rings, clothes, and jewels, and come and sup with you every evening!—Do you understand me now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Perfectly, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, and—hay!—Does not the plan tickle your fancy? Do not your veins tingle, your heart beat, your—hay? What say you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>I really, Sir, don't know what to say—except that I cannot comply, unless a
<pb n="9" facs="19"/>
Lady, whom I think it my duty to consult, should give her consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>What Lady? Who?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Lady Peckham, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>My wife!—Zounds! Are you mad? Tell my wife?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>I shall further ask the advice of your son and daughter, who will wonder at your charity, in taking a poor orphan like me under your protection; will be happy to see themselves ruined for my sake, and will profit by the example of so venerable a father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Poh! Nonsense!</p>

<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>

<p>Lord! Sir Paul! I have been your physician for these fifteen years!</p>

<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Leave! Why, charming Lydia, will you afflict me thus? Have I not declared my purpose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Which cannot be accomplished. You promise marriage, but your father will never consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Then we will marry without his consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Oh, no! Do not hope it! When I marry, it shall be to render both my husband and myself respectable, and happy: not to embitter, not to dishonour both.</p>

<p>No, no! Overjoyed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Who is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>I scarcely can tell you. A gentleman who used to visit me in the convent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Have you been long acquainted?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="22"/>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Little more than two years; during which he was my monitor, consoler, and guide</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Seeing him before he enters]</stage> His appearance—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mr. DORIMONT.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Running to meet him]</stage> Ah! Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am happy to have found you once again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>What, Sir, has brought you to England?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Business; part of which was to see you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>You have been always generous and kind—Yet I am sorry you should see me thus.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why? <stage>[Eagerly]</stage> What are you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>An humble dependant—A lady's companion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Alas! Why did you leave the convent without informing me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>'Twas unexpected.—You had forborne your visits; and I feared death, or some misfortune. At my mother's decease, the young lady with whom I live having an affection for me, and seeing me deserted, offered to take me with her to England, promising I should rather be her friend than her companion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>And has she kept her word?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>On her part faithfully, tenderly!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>That is some consolation!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>But—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>She has a mother, who does not fail to make inseriority feelingly understand itself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="23"/>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[With some emotion]</stage> Indeed!— <stage>[Collecting himself]</stage> But with whom were you in such earnest conversation when I entered?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>The brother of my young lady: a gentleman worthy your esteem.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>And worthy yours?—You blush!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Do you blame me for being just?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>No—He is rich, young, and handsome.—Do you often meet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>We do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>You are lovely, inexperienced, and unprotected!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Fear nothing—I shall not easily forget myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[Earnestly]</stage> I hope not.—But what does he say?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>That he loves me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Is that all?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>No—He offers me secret marriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p><hi>Secret</hi> marriage!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>I see the danger, and wish to shun it.—You may find me some place of refuge in France.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Can you so easily renounce all the flattering prospects love has raised?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and not only them, but love itself, when it is my duty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Noble-minded girl!—Remain where you are—Nay, indulge your hopes; for know, your lover will be honoured by your hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Sir!—Honoured.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Honoured!—By birth you are greatly his superior.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Can you be serious?—Oh, trifle not
<pb n="14" facs="24"/>
with a too trembling heart!—Why did my mother conceal this secret from me?—Or, if true, why die and leave it unrevealed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>There were reasons—She was not your mother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Not!—Oh, sir! You have conjured up ten thousand busy thoughts!—Is my mother living?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>My father?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>He is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Why has he so long forsaken me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>That must be told hereafter. Be patient—wait the event.—You are acquainted, I think, with Count Conolly Villars?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>He visits here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>I have business with him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Sir! I fear you will meet a cool reception! Your humble appearance and his pride will but ill agree.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Fear not—My business is to lower his pride.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Sir! He may insult you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Humble though I myself am, I hope to teach him humility. To visit you, and to accomplish this, was the purport of my journey.—Adieu for the present—Think on what I have said; and, though by birth you are noble, remember, virtue alone is true nobility.</p>

<stage>[Lydia rings. Exit Mr. Dorimont, and enter Lucy: her dress more characteristic of the girl than of the woman; and her manner full of life, but tempered by the most delicate sensibility.]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Well, Lydia! Any news for me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Mac Dermot has been here, with
<pb n="15" facs="25"/>
the Count's compliments; but in reality to see if Lady Peckham were at home. You know how much he wishes to avoid her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and I don't wonder at it.—She has just been with me, ushering her orders, as she calls it.—"I desires, Miss, you vill receive Sir Samooel Sheepy as your intended spouse."—And so she has sent me here to be courted; and the inamorato is coming, as soon as he can take breath and courage!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>But why, my dear, do you indulge yourself in mocking your mamma?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Lydia, I must either laugh or cry; and, though I laugh, I assure you it is often with an aching heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>My dear girl!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>I hope, however, you will own there is no great harm in laughing a little at this charming Adonis, this whimsical lover of mine!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>What can his reason be for making love to me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>There's a question! Pray, my dear, do you never look in your glass?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Um—yes—But does he never look in his glass too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps his sight begins to decay.—But are not you alarmed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Do not you love the Count?</p>

<p>Um—Yes.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Well! And you know how violent and prejudiced Lady Peckham is!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Perfectly! But I have Sir Paul on my side; and, as for Sir Samuel, he was dandled so
<pb n="16" facs="26"/>
long in the nursery, and is still so much of the aukward, bashful boy, that he will never dare to put the question directly to me; and I am determined never to understand him till he does.</p>

I make 'em ill! They are always sick of me! Hem!—'Tis very strange that I can't learn to talk without having a word to say! A thing so common too! Why can't I give myself monkey airs, skip here and there, be self-sufficient, impertinent, and behave like a puppy, purposely to please the ladies? What! Is there no such thing to be found as a woman who can love a man for his modesty? This foreign count, now, my rival, is quite a different thing! He <stage>[Mimicking]</stage>—He walks with a straight back, and a cocked-up chin, and a strut, and a stride, and stares, and takes snuff, and—! Yes, yes!

<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Why do you thus seek solitude?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>To indulge thought.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Has your friend brought you bad news?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>

<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Lydia! I conjure you not to keep me on the rack!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>I was enjoined silence, but I feel my heart has no secrets for you—Yet, you will laugh.</p>

<p>Ungenerous Lydia!</p>

<sp>
<pb n="22" facs="32"/>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Yes; you will think me mad.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Lydia, you are unjust.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>

<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Foot.</speaker>
<p>A gentleman to you, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>This sudden return, Sir, is kind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>I have bethought me. The moment is critical, and what I have to communicate of importance. Are we secure?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>We are. This is my apartment. <stage>[Lydia goes and bolts the door.]</stage> Have you seen the Count, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>No. But I have written to him anonymously.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>And why anonymously?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>To rouse his feelings, wound his vanity, and excite his anger. His slumbering faculties must be awakened.—Is he kind to you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="23" facs="33"/>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>No. Yet I believe him to be generous, benevolent, and noble of heart; though his habitual haughtiness gives him the appearance of qualities the very reverse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Worthy, kind girl!—You were born for the consolation of a too unfortunate father!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Again you remind me that I have a father. Why am I not allowed to see him? Why am I not suffered to fly into his arms?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>He dreads lest his wretched and pitiable condition should make you meet him with coldness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Oh! How little does he know my heart! Yet speak; tell me, what monster was the cause of his misery?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>The monster Pride.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Pride!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Your mother's pride, which first squandered his wealth, and next endangered his life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>How you alarm me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>A despicable dispute for precedency was the occasion of a duel, in which your father killed his antagonist, whose enraged family, by suborning witnesses, caused him to be convicted of murder, obliged him to fly the kingdom, and with your mother wander under a borrowed name, a fugitive in distant countries.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Heavens!—But why leave me ignorant of my birth?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>That, being unfortunate, you might be humble: that you might not grieve after happiness which you seemed destined
<pb n="24" facs="34"/>
not to enjoy. 'Twas the precaution of a fond father, desirous to alleviate, if not succour your distress.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Oh! How I burn to see him!—Is he not in danger? Is his life secure?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>He himself can scarcely say. His enemies have discovered him, are hot in pursuit, and fertile in stratagems and snares. They know that justice is now busied in his behalf; but justice is slow, and revenge is restless.—Their activity, I hear, is redoubled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Guard, I conjure you, guard my father's safety! Let me fly to seek him! Conduct me to his feet!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>He wished you first to be informed of his true situation; lest, knowing him to be noble, you should expect to see him in all the pomp of affluence, instead of meeting a poor, dejected, forlorn old man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>His fears are unjust; injurious to every feeling of filial affection and duty! The little I have I will freely partake with him. My clothes, the diamond which my supposed mother left me, whatever I possess shall instantly be sold for his relief: my life shall be devoted to soften his sorrows. Oh that I could prove myself worthy to be his daughter! Oh that I could pour out my soul to secure his felicity!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Forbear!—Let me breathe!—Affection cannot find utterance!—Oh! this melting heart!—My child!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>My Lydia!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Heavens!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>My child!—My daughter!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="25" facs="35"/>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Falling at his feet]</stage> Can it be?—My father!—Oh ecstasy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Rise, my child!—Suffer me to appease my melting heart!—Oh, delight of my eyes!—Why is not your brother like you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>My brother! Who? Have I a brother?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>The Count is your brother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>'Tis too much!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>He is not worthy such a sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>The sister of the Count! I!—Ah! Nature, thy instincts are fabulous: for, were they not, his heart would have beaten as warmly toward me, as mine has done for him!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>I will make him blush at his arrogance. You shall witness his confusion; which shall be public, that it may be effectual.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Would you have me avoid explanation with him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes, for the present.—I mean to see him. Our meeting will be warm; but he shall feel the authority of a father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>If you are a stranger to him, I fear lest—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>No, no. He knows me, but knows not all his obligations to me.—I have secretly supplied him with money, and gained him promotion; which he has vainly attributed to his personal merits. But I must be gone. My burthened heart is eased! Once more, dear child of my affections, be prudent. I have much to apprehend; but, should the present moment prove benign, my future days will all be peace!</p>

<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am sorry it is necessary, Sir! What! The head of a house! The father of a family! Oh! Shame! He who, tottering on the brink of the grave, would gratify appetites which he no longer knows, by reducing the happy to misery and the innocent to guilt, deserves to sink into that contempt and infamy into which he would plunge unwary simplicity.</p>

<p>No, Sir Paul; by no means—No—I—That is—I will acknowledge, I am not very much accustomed to such familiarities.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Sir—I—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am the man to make you throw off! I'll teach you to kick your stateliness down stairs, and toss your pride, as I do my wig, behind the fire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Good breeding, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Good breeding, Sir, is a blockhead, Sir! None of your sormal Don Glums! None of your <hi>grand pas</hi> for me! A friend, good fellowship, and t'other bottle! That's my motto!</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Damn distinctions!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>They make it a condition, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Indeed!—Look you, my dear Count, either unbridle, or you and I are two. You tell me you love my daughter—She is the finest girl in England; and I believe the slut has taken a fancy to you. The match pleases me, because it displeases my wife—And, except when you are riding your high horse, I like you, Count.—Dismount, and it's a match.—If not, turn the peg, and prance! I'm your humble!</p>

<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>The Count your brother?—My sister, my family, must be informed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Not on your life, Edmund. So implacable are his enemies, that my father informs me an Exempt, bribed by them, has followed him to England.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Impotent malice! The laws will here protect him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Oh! I know a great deal more than you suspect—Not but you seem to be taking measures to inform the whole house.</p>

<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! No no—Nothing—I—I don't know what I am saying.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Why surely you don't imagine your fondness for each other is any secret?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Sister! I don't understand—Are you narrow-minded enough to suppose this young lady unworthy the hand of—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Of my brother?—No—To call my Lydia Sister <stage>[Taking her hand]</stage> is one of the things on earth I most fervently wish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>My generous friend!</p>
</sp>

<p>My charming girl!</p>

<p>But—then—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>There are now no buts! It will be an honour—I say, sister, you—you don't know—In short I must very earnestly solicit you to treat
<pb n="45" facs="59"/>
Miss Lydia with all possible delicacy—I—I—I cannot tell you more at present—But I once again request, I conjure, nay I—</p>

<p>Indeed I don't!—There now goes one of your Lord and Masters! Take care of him! He'll make an excellent grand Turk— <stage>[Humorously burlesquing]</stage> Treat Miss Lydia, I say, with all possible delicacy—And have I, Lydia, have I shewn a want of delicacy to my friend?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Oh, no! My heart throbs with an oppressive sense of your generous, your affectionate attention to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Oppressive?—Well! This is the proudest world!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I didn't mean—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Oh! No matter!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Have you had any conversation with the Count?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>No—There has been no opportunity yet to-day—I am really afraid his pride is quite as absurd as that of my good Mamma!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>And your affection begins to cool.</p>
</sp>

<p>Um—I—I can't say that—Heigho!—He has his faults.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Bowing]</stage> I was afraid, Madam, love

would not have found so much as a moment to speak its anxieties—Nay even now— <stage>[Looking haughtily toward Lydia.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p><stage>[Pointedly, and almost in tears]</stage> Sir, I—I am sensible of my own unworthiness. <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>That lady, Sir, is my friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Why are you surprised?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Madam!—No—no, not surprised—There is a maxim, indeed, which says—Friendship can only subsist between equals.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>But where is the inferiority?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>You are above the poor, the pitiful idea, that wealth confers any claims?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps it does not, Madam. But beauty, understanding, wit, in short, mind, confers ten thousand! And in these I never beheld your peer!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Very prettily spoken, indeed! And I am almost persuaded that you love me very dearly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I adore you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you are continually thinking of my good qualities.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Eternally, Madam! I think of nothing else!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>True—You never remember your own!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Were I totally insensible of my own, Madam, I should be unworthy of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>You admire me even in my representatives, my relations and friends! Affable to all, good-humoured to all, attentive to all, your politeness, ease, and urbanity extend to every
<pb n="47" facs="61"/>
person for whom you think my heart is any way interested! Your passions are all subservient to love!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Madam; subservient is the very word! They are all subservient to love!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>You never recollect the dignity of your descent, nor accuse mine of meanness! You have too much understanding to plume your thoughts with turgid arrogance; or to presume on the imaginary merit of an accident, which none but ignorance, prejudice, and folly, are so besotted as to attribute to themselves!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Mankind have agreed, Madam, to honour the descendants of the wise and the brave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>They have so—But you have too much native merit to arrogate to yourself the worth of others! You are no jay, decked in the peacock's feathers! You are not idiot enough to imagine that a skin of parchment, on which is emblazoned the arms and acts of one wise man, with a long list of succeeding fools, is any honour to you! Responsible to mankind for the use or the abuse of such talents as you feel yourself endowed with, you think only of how you may deserve greatly; and disdain to be that secondary thing, that insignificant cypher, which is worthless except from situation!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>The feelings of injured honour, Madam, perhaps may be too irritable. They shrink from insult, and spurn at contamination! Yet honour is the source of a thousand virtues! The parent of ten thousand glorious deeds! Honour is generous, sincere, and magnanimous! The protector of innocence, the assertor of right, the
<pb n="48" facs="62"/>
avenger of wrong! Yes! Honour is the patron of arts, the promoter of science, the bulwark of government, the defender of kings, and the saviour of nations!—Indulge me then in cherishing a sentiment so noble!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Indulge?—Applaud, you mean! Honour with you never degenerates into ostentation! Is never presumptuous! Is no boaster! Is eager to earn, but scorns to extort pre-eminence! Your honour is not that abject inflated phantom which usurps contested claims, exacts submission which it does not merit, offends, irritates, and incites disgust, nay tarnishes even virtue itself! You do not, under the word Honour, seek a miserable cobweb covering for exorbitant pride!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Madam, accusation so pointed, so—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Nay, now! Have not I been reading your panegyric?</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter a <hi>FOOTMAN.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Foot.</speaker>
<p>My lady desires you will come to her immediately, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Very well <stage>[Exit Footman].</stage>—I am a thoughtless, slighty girl! What I say can have but little meaning—Else, indeed, I would have ventured to have given you a word of advice—But—'Tis no matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Madam, you have stung me to the soul! If I am indeed what you describe, 'twere time I should reform.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>I must be gone.—I have, I own, been wildly picturing something to myself, which I greatly fear I could not love! <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>And is it my likeness?—Surely it
<pb n="49" facs="63"/>
cannot be!—Could not love?—Excruciating thought! <stage>[Exit after Lucy.</stage></p>

<p>Why are you so much alarmed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>The clouds are collected, and the storm is coming!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Lady Peckham has watched her opportunity: Sir Paul has dropt asleep in his armchair; she has ordered your sister to her apartment, and has sent to the Count to come and speak with her; that is, to come and be insulted, here in the drawing-room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>What can be done?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>I know not—I dread her intolerable tongue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps were you to retire, and, when they grow warm▪ to interrupt them at the proper moment, the presence of a third person might be some restraint on the workings of pride; of the violent ebullitions of which I am in great apprehension.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>

That the magnificence in which he has lived looked with contempt on the petty paltry strainings of a trader's pride!—And that in his hall are daily fed— <stage>[Stops short, and betrays a consciousness of inadvertent falsehood, but suddenly continues with increasing vehemence]</stage> Yes, Madam, are daily fed, now, at this moment, Madam, more faithful adherents, with their menials and followers, than all your boasted wealth could for a single year supply!</p>

<p>'Tis so sudden—Yet my heart feels an affection—</p>

<p>Which is stifled by your vanity! Your father is contemned, because he is unfortunate!</p>

<p>No, Sir. I do not merit a reproach so cruel. Contemn my father! You know me not.—Tell me, which way can I prove my respect and love?</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. <hi>Dor.</hi></speaker>
<p>Talk not of their pride, but of

your own! You complain of others haughtiness? You! In whom the vice is so intolerable, that you willingly would disown your father!</p>

<p>Pshaw!" Come, come—Lady Peckham is waiting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>I must own, Sir Paul, I meet with many mortifications. Your daughter is an angel. But there are certain things to which a man

of my rank must not, cannot stoop. Do you, Sir Paul, come to an agreement with your lady, and I am ready.— <stage>[Calls]</stage> Mac Dermot!—I'll return in a moment. <stage>[Retires.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Now, if the demon of ambition did not possess me, I should never truckle to the self-sufficient airs of this man of rank! He has put a spell upon me!—I'll break with him this moment—Yet, if I do that, all is over. My authority is gone! Madam will be triumphant; and then farewel to submission!—Beside, the honour of the alliance! Nobility! Precedence! A family so famous! 'Sblood! Who knows but my grandson may be a Marshal of France? <stage>[To the Count, who returns]</stage> Come, come, Count; let us begone. You must make your peace with my Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Solicitation, Sir Paul, does not become me; it is a thing I have not been accustomed to. Do you speak for me. Say all, say every thing you please. Your mediation will, I presume, be sufficient.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[Quite angry]</stage> Damn me if this is not beyond all human patience! After all I have done in your behalf! What! Would you have me and my whole family approach your footstool, there present my daughter, and kneeling beg your highness to accept her? No, my haughty Count! Either my daughter is worth asking for, or not worth having. Carry your pomp to a better market; I'll stoop to it no longer. Your servant, Sir! <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>

ancient race! The rightful lord of athousand vassals! Ought I to cringe in supplicatory baseness, use servile dishonourable adulation, bend to sufflated wealth, act the parasite to new-fledged pride, and petition where I should command? No! Earth should hide me rather! But that love, imperious love hurries me forward, with impulse irresistible! What! Wait, and fawn on Madam, and mince, and simper, and act the skipjack, and chatter to her parrot, and be of her opinion, and fetch and carry, and praise her taste, and join her scandal, and laugh when she laughs, and kiss her monkey!—And to whom?—Oh! <stage>[Exit.</stage></p>

<p>I am told, Sir, I have some obligations to you, which it becomes me to discharge.</p>

<p>Either speak your business, and suffer me to pass, or I will nail you to the door!</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Dear Sir, you are so warm! <stage>[Bowing]</stage>—I have been told you were so good as to threaten to cane me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir? By whom!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>By Lady Peckham, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!—Well; suppose it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>'Twas kind of you!—Unluckily, I have not been much used to threatening messages, and am really afraid I shall not be very prompt at submission.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Oh, do not doubt yourself, Sir.</p>

<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>

<p>Gadso! True, Sir! I should be sorry to be interrupted—Luckily, my carriage is at the door; and I know a snug room in a

<p>BE pacified: you are too much alarmed.</p>

<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>If Sir Paul should have let them pass, what dreadful consequences may have followed! Where can he be?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir!—Where are they?—Has any thing happened?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Happened!—Dammee! I could not believe my own ears!—A silky Simon!—The Count was in a right humour—'Sblood! I had a great mind to have let him kill the old fool.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
<p>Then they have not fought! Are they safe, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes, yes; they are safe enough—But do you know the amorous swain, his blood being heated, could only be pacified on condition that he might have another interview with Lucy!—I'm glad on't!—I'll go and give her her lesson.</p>

<p>Oh, Sir, leave him to my sister, she needs no instructions.</p>

<p>No?—Gad, I believe not! She's my own girl! But clear the coast; he is coming!</p>

<p>I will go to Lady Peckham; and do you, Lydia, watch for the Count.</p>

<p>Ay, ay. He is suddenly grown humble; apologized to me, and promised to come and plead with my lady. But away.</p>

<p>Well, Sir Samuel, you are here!</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. <stage>[Aside]</stage> And I half wish I was any where else, already.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>And so you absolutely have the courage to attack my Lucy? Ha, ha, ha! Why you are quite a hero! You fear neither man nor woman!</p>

<p><stage>[Aside]</stage> I wish I didn't—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, but don't begin to look so pitiful! She'll be here in a minute. Don't flinch! Stand to your guns! She'll not easily strike! Ha, ha, ha! Die hard, my old boy!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>What is the matter with me? I declare he has talked me into a tremble! Why should I be so terrified at a harmless woman? I can't help it! A pair of beautiful eyes are flaming swords, which no armour can resist!</p>

<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>You seem taken by surprise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Madam—Hem!—No, Madam—Yes, Madam. <stage>[With his usual bows.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>My Papa informed me you were waiting, purposely to disclose this important secret.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Madam—Hem!—Yes, Madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Do you know that I have had you in my mind I don't know how often, since I saw you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem!—Have you, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I have—'Tis a pity, nay indeed a shame, that so famous an English family as that of the Sheepy's should become extinct.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem!—There is no danger of that, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>No!—Why it is too late in life for you to marry, Sir Samuel—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem!—Yes, Madam. No, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! So you—! Well! I should like to know your choice—Some staid body, I imagine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Madam—Hem!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>But I would not have her too old, and disagreeable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem! I can assure you, Madam—She—Hem!—She is a very beautiful young lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>You surprise me!—Oh! Then perhaps she is some low-born girl, who has more pride than understanding, and is willing to sacrifice her youth, and beauty, to the silly vanity of riding in a coach?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Quite—Hem!—Quite the contrary, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Then she must be poor, and must think
<pb n="83" facs="101"/>
of marrying you for the sake of your riches, hoping you will die soon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Madam—Hem! She is very rich.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>And I should flatter myself would not expect me to die too soon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Oh! But she will! Young women never marry old men, but with a wish to dance over their graves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps the poor girl may—may have made a <hi>faux pas.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem! Her virtue is unspotted, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>You amaze me! Young, rich, beautiful, and virtuous! What can her reason be for making choice of you? Why does not she rather marry some youth, whose rare qualities resemble her own?—Oh! I've found the secret at last! She's an idiot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem! No, Madam—No—Hem!—I am afraid she has too much wit!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Nay then, Sir Samuel, you are the most fortunate gentleman I ever heard or read of!—But are you sure she is in love with you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem! N—Not very, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>No!—Oh ho! I have unriddled it at last! You have been bargaining for her with her father, or her mother, or—Ay, ay! The poor young lady's consent has never been asked!—And would you be so selfish as to seek your own single gratification, and be contented to see her condemned to misery, pining to death for the youth she loves, and justly detesting the
<pb n="84" facs="102"/>
sight of you, as the wicked unfeeling author of her wretchedness?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem! <stage>[Looking toward the door]</stage> Madam I—Hem!—I wish you a good evening.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Preventing his going]</stage> Another word, Sir Samuel. Have you ever talked to the young lady on the subject?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem! I—Hem!—I have and—Hem! I have not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>You never made a direct proposal?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem! No, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>But why?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>I, I—Hem!—I can't very well tell.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>But I can.—With much folly and depravity, there is still some virtue in you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Madam! <stage>[Looking how to escape.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Though you could form so unjust a project, you never had the courage to insult the lady by an avowal of your guilt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hem! Guilt, Madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, guilt—However, Sir, she has perfectly understood your insinuations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>She has infinite respect for filial duties. But, though she would beware of offending her parents, I know her to be equally determined never to entail misery on herself; nor to accept a husband whom she could neither esteem, admire, nor love!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Madam—I—Hem!—Your servant, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Between him and the door]</stage> Not till you first promise—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="85" facs="103"/>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p><stage>[Forgetting his fear]</stage> I'll promise any thing, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>That you will not render yourself more ridiculous, by persevering in so absurd, so unjust a pursuit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>No, Madam! I'm quite ridiculous enough already!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Nay, more, that you will not seek some less friended, more enslaved, or more timid young creature, whom your misapplied wealth might command.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Whatever you please, Madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>But that you will rather apply your superfluous hoards to the protection of youthful innocence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Suffer me but to depart, Madam, and I will bequeath my estates in perpetuity as you shall direct; I'll entail them on the Magdalen; or I'll advertise for marriageable men and maids, and you shall portion out my money among them! I'll—I'll do any thing, except marry, or go a courting!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Why then, Sir Samuel— <stage>[Kissing his hand]</stage> There—That be your reward.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Sam.</hi></speaker>
<p>Madam—Your humble servant.</p>
<stage>[Exit abruptly.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Poor Sir Samuel! This is the first time he ever forgot his bow. <stage>[Enter the <hi>COUNT.]</hi></stage> Well, Sir! have you effectually made your peace with my mamma?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>I have done my endeavour, Madam—Would I were at peace with myself!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>And are you still, Sir, under the dominion of prejudice so weak? Do you still repent
<pb n="86" facs="106"/>
of what you so long have deemed your condescension?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Far otherwise, Madam. There are beings so peculiarly favoured of heaven, and endowed with such high perfections, both of body and of mind, that they are superior to all the distinctions of men, among whom they walk angels upon earth! You are one of these! And my misery is, I never can deserve you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>You may have stumbled, but this selfcondemnation shews it was but to rise with tenfold strength. Persevere, and we will be severed only by death.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> EDMUND.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>At length, my dear Count, Lady Peckham is pacified. To stoop to her ill-placed pride, to overlook her prejudice, and to petition as you did, was noble in you. I have seconded your efforts, have pledged myself for your honour, and guaranteed your veracity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Then, Sir, you have struck a dagger to my heart! I have been guilty of falsehood! That very pride, and that exalted, or I fear extravagant, sense of honour, which should have preserved me from a stain so hateful, have dashed me down the precipice!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>You amaze me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>'Tis true, 'twas inadvertent; but rankling vanity, strengthened by a purer motive, the trembling alarms of love, induced me to persist; nay, a second time to aid deception.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>You did wrong—But which of us can say they never erred?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>Ay! Who will stand forth and affirm,
<pb n="87" facs="107"/>
that, amid the rude whirl, the confused doubts, or the terrors of passion, they never once have been betrayed into your crime? For a crime I own it is; and with consequences so wide, so pernicious, and so fatal, that, when it shall be extirpated from the earth, that moment man will be perfect! But, in this poor world's present state, it is so far venial, that (painful, humiliating thought!) no—the noblest, the purest of us all, cannot strike his heart, and say—I never was a liar!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Frail as we are, and hourly as the arts of falsehood are practised upon us, to our detriment, and often to our ruin, those only are most free from guilt, who shake contagion soonest from them; and, by the next sublime effort of truth, scorning to shrink from shame, which is their due, in some sort turn the vice itself to virtue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Edm.</speaker>
<p>But what have you said that—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SIR PAUL.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Come, come! We must strike while the iron is hot! We must take my Lady while she is in the humour, since she must necessarily be a party in our deeds. And first I have agreed, as you know, Count, that my daughter's portion shall be 80,000l. The remainder will chiefly rest with you. What settlement do you intend to make? And on what estates?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>None, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>None!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

After the enquiries I made, I cannot be so deceived! Are not you Count Connolly Villars?</p>

<p>A colonel in the armies of the Most Christian King?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>I am, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Recommended to me by Messieurs Devigny, the great merchants at Marseilles?</p>
</sp>

<p>The same, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why, then, what do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>When I first paid my addresses to this lady, I imagined my rank and family were a sufficient counterpoise to wealth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ha! Gold in one scale, honour in t'other?—Flimsy ware!—No, no—Kick the beam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>But, ardent, violent, and eternal, as my love for your angelic daughter is, and must be, even the loss of her shall not tempt me, any longer, to practise the least imposition.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Paul.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, but, 's blood! The steward! The family estates!</p>

<sp>

<p>He has been in some fray, and is so bruised!</p>

<p>Charming, generous girl!—This poor Mac Dermot!</p>

<p>He is afraid of seeing you. He says you will never pardon him, for having taken the part of some man, whom you threatened to murder!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>I? I threatened to murder no man!—Will you, Madam, be so kind as to tell him I am here; and that I insist on seeing him?</p>

<p>No great matter, my Lord—Only a little bit of a joint here. <stage>[Pointing to his arm.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Alarmed]</stage> Broken?</p>

<p>Much!—How?—What have you been doing?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Pitifully]</stage> I hope your Lordship won't be angry! <stage>[Enraged]</stage> But the rascals sazed him neck and heels!</p>

<p>Who are you talking of?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Pitifully]</stage> To be sure, he—he sent your Lordship a—a viry impartinent letter.</p>

<p>How? <stage>[The Count's perplexities and passions are here effectually roused, and increase through the scene.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>There were three of them. Niver did your Lordship set your two good-looking eyes on such a pair of thieves!</p>
</sp>

<p>For heaven's sake, tell your story straight forward! What letter do you mean? Who?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p><stage>[With great emotion]</stage> I hope your Lordship will forget and forgive! It would have moved the bowels of your compassion, to have seen the ould gintleman!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible? What can he mean? What old gentleman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Enraged]</stage> The dirty shaberoons took him by the throat—My viry blood boiled!—Upon my soul, my Lord, I could not bear it! I hope you will forgive me! By the merciful father, I could not bear it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Tell me, this moment, who you mean!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>He came running back, out of breath, and asked for your Lordship. And so, my Lord, <stage>[Pleading]</stage> being a fillow-crater in distriss—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Came where?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>A couple of as ill-looking Tyburnturnpike bum-bailiffs as your Lordship could

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Once more, tell me instantly, what old gentleman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>Considering his age, he is as active, and as brave a fillow, as ever handled a fist.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage> He cannot surely mean my father! Mac Dermot, I entreat, I command you to tell me of whom you are talking.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac. D.</speaker>
<p>If your Lordship had but seen the noble ould soul, I'm sure you would have forgiven me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>But what letter—?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>Oh! The divle burn the letter! Now, my Lord, don't mention it! Pray don't remimber it, your Lordship! Pray don't! By my soul, now, my Lord, he is a fine ould fillow! Oh! How he laid about him!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Was it the person who came this afternoon?</p>
</sp>

<p>My Lord—</p>
</sp>

<p>Fear nothing! Speak.</p>

<p>Why, then, my Lord—To be sure—it was he himsilf.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>And is he safe? Did you free him from them?</p>
</sp>

<p>Why, my Lord, I could not hilp it! <stage>[Emphatically]</stage> I could not hilp it! By the holy footstool, but I couldn't!</p>

<p>Faith, my Lord, that will be a little too much! I've lost quite blood enough already.</p>

<p>Pray! I request! I must have you do as I desire! I would not have any ill happen to you, for the world!</p>

<speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
<p>Oh! And the divle of ill or harm can happen to Mac Dermot, the while he has such an a ginerous prince royal of a master! Though I believe, the best thing that could happen to me just now, would be a good supper, and a hearty tiff of whisky punch.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Not for the Indies!</p>

<p>Sir, wrung as my heart is by remorse, and guilty as I know myself, for I have still increase of guilt, no words can mitigate my crimes. Yet, though I have erred, I feel I have something in me capable of good; and strong propensities to all the tender ties, the filial duties, and the severer virtues which I have seemed to want; a mind which, once convinced, has strength to shun and to subdue its master passion,
<pb n="96" facs="118"/>
renounce its folly, and abhor its turpitude. Deep is my offence against you and nature! But let nature plead in my behalf. Here at your feet, repentant for my faults, I claim that pity which a father so good, and so affectionate, will not sure refuse.</p>

<p>Chequered are the scenes of life. Pleasure and pain, joy and grief, austerity and laughter, intermingling, weave a motley web. Our prejudices are our punishments: they cling about us, warp our actions, distort our manners, render us the food of satire, the mockery of fools, and torture us, as wailing urchins are tormented to make sport for boys. Error and folly impede the progress of perfection.

Truth alone can make men wise and happy. Myself the sacrifice of falsehood and mistake, feebly have I striven to stem the torrent▪ and here my task, and here I hope my troubles end.</p>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. MATTOCKS.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>THE curtain dropt, of course the author sends</l>
<l>Me to salute our gen'rous noble friends!</l>
<l>To me you listen, he politely says,</l>
<l>Whene'er I prattle, with a wish to praise.</l>
<l>For kindness so unceasing may you be</l>
<l>As happy, ev'ry soul, as your applause makes me!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But to my text—The theme to-night is Pride:</l>
<l>Much have we said—and much more have implied.</l>
<l>Our boldest strokes are feeble, nor can shew</l>
<l>The child of Pride with half his genuine glow;</l>
<l>Of Pride, which can such various forms assume;</l>
<l>Now rise an emperor, now sink a groom.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Mounted aloft, the wonder of his age,</l>
<l>With hackney coachmen furious war to wage;</l>
<l>Six swandown waistcoats swathe him into shape;</l>
<l>His legs all buckskin, and his coat all cape;</l>
<l>With manners, looks, and language such you'd swear</l>
<l>His tutor had been Piccadilly's Bear;</l>
<l>When most contemptible most hoping praise,</l>
<l>And only envious of the groom he pays;</l>
<l>Four dappled greys in front, behind three men;</l>
<l>Down Pall-Mall dashing, to dash up again;</l>
<l>Then only in his height and pomp of pride,</l>
<l>When Girl or Gambler's seated by his side;</l>
<l><pb n="102" facs="124"/>
Driving by day, dicing by night, his passion;</l>
<l>Such is the modern man of high-flown fashion!</l>
<l>Such are the scions sprung from Runny-Mead!</l>
<l>The richest soil, that bears the rankest weed!</l>
<l>Potatoe like, the sprouts are worthless found;</l>
<l>And all that's good of them is under ground.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Of Pride one single sketch in crayons more.</l>
<l>Behold her torch! Hark! Thunder shakes the door!</l>
<l>The carriage stops; the footmen make a lane;</l>
<l>The feathers stoop, and enter Lady Jane:</l>
<l>Perfect in how d'ye do, drop, bob, and bow.</l>
<l>(Curtseys, my friends, are out of fashion now)— <stage>[To the Galleries]</stage></l>
<l>First to his Grace; next to the next of birth:</l>
<l>She none forgets—save genius, wit, and worth;</l>
<l>Whom if she mark, 'tis with a modish stare,</l>
<l>To ask who knows them? or, How came they there?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now at the bank, in antichamber kept,</l>
<l>Where Pharaoh's host twelve tedious hours had slept,</l>
<l>She seats herself, like palpitating lover,</l>
<l>Eager the last night's losses to recover.</l>
<l>No sense of virtue, dignity, or shame:</l>
<l>Her greatest pride her knowledge of the game.</l>
<l>That pride most piqued, most mortified, to see</l>
<l>A Nabob's wife stake larger sums than she!</l>
<l>And now three anxious hours have slipt away:</l>
<l>Three hundreds have been lost, in piddling play.</l>
<l>No luck for her! Aloud fresh cards she calls:</l>
<l>Her passions rising as her pocket falls.</l>
<l>She punts: again she loses; and again!</l>
<l>Oaths quiver on her lip! She names the ten.</l>
<l><pb n="103" facs="125"/>
Stung to the soul, a desp'rate sett she makes;</l>
<l>Till even the winning banker deals and quakes.</l>
<l>Ghastly she pants, with horror in her eye,</l>
<l>To be the first the fatal card to spy.</l>
<l>The fatal card is turn'd, and ends the reign</l>
<l>Of Fashion, Folly, Pride, and Lady Jane!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Here too we end; oblig'd ourselves to own</l>
<l>Our pride is great—when we can please the town.</l>
