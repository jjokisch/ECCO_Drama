<p>MORE WAYS THAN ONE, A COMEDY, AS ACTED AT THE <hi>THEATRE ROYAL</hi> IN COVENT GARDEN. By MRS. COWLEY.</p>

<head>DEDICATION.</head>
<lg>
<l>FLY, comic scenes! where distant Ganges laves</l>
<l>Hindostan's golden shores, with hallow'd waves;</l>
<l>Where palms gigantic rear their tufted heads,</l>
<l>And nature in colossal vegetation spreads,</l>
<l>Where rich ananas court the Indian's eye,</l>
<l>And groves of citrons fan the fev'rish sky,</l>
<l>Where rattling canes around the riv'lets play,</l>
<l>And the centennial aloe drinks the day!</l>
<l>In their deep shades bid Lucidorus smile,</l>
<l>His heavy sense of <hi>distant</hi> hours beguile.</l>
<l>Bid him not think, because I gaily write,</l>
<l>That heavy hours to him, to me, are light;</l>
<l>My native spirits, bounding from repose,</l>
<l>Bear me, unwilling, where Castalia flows.</l>
<l>I love to weep, love the soft feast of grief,</l>
<l>Court mournful thoughts, nor ever wish relief;—</l>
<l><hi>Sadness</hi> I woo, yet still the phantom flies,</l>
<l>And <hi>joy</hi> seduces, whilst I ask for sighs.</l>
<l><pb n="ii" facs="3"/>
But Hymen frowns, and joy no longer cheers,</l>
<l>Weeping, I sink—Thalia drinks my tears:</l>
<l>He tears my heart; she my rapt soul inspires;</l>
<l>He chills with grief; she fills me with her fires.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus, Lucidorus! pass <hi>my</hi> distant hours—</l>
<l>By turns subdued, the slave of rival powers;</l>
<l>And thus hath nature in my little frame</l>
<l>Still various been, and variously the same.</l>
<l>My heart so keenly feels, 'twere death to live,</l>
<l>Did not bright spirits its strong sense relieve.</l>
<l>Through THESE capricious, desultory, gay,</l>
<l>As though I felt not, glides th' unconscious day;</l>
<l>Through THIS I droop, I sadden, and complain,</l>
<l>Dragging, with pensive steps, life's length'ning chain.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>In blithesome mood <hi>"More Ways than One"</hi> had birth,</l>
<l>Offspring of brilliant morns, and eves of mirth;</l>
<l>The laughing muse in sprightliest vein was by,</l>
<l>And "quips, and cranks," lay lurking in her eye.</l>
<l>O! may her spirit from its pages dart,</l>
<l>Dance o'er your nerves, and live within your heart!</l>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>BY A CLERGYMAN.</byline>
<stage>SPOKEN BY MR. BONNER, IN THE CHARACTER OF MERCURY.</stage>
<stage>Enter hastily from the upper end of the stage, as if just alighted.</stage>
<lg>
<l>SOME <hi>eau de luce!</hi> Your fans, dear ladies, pray!</l>
<l>Strait from Parnassus—'tis a dev'lish way!</l>
<l>I might have strode our Pegasus's back,</l>
<l>But the poor devil's grown so mere a hack;</l>
<l>So often call'd upon—taught such strange paces,</l>
<l>That alter'd woefully, alack, his case is!</l>
<l>In former times, but once or twice a-year</l>
<l>The fiery steed was summon'd to appear;</l>
<l>Then in elegiac <hi>pas grave</hi> seen dancing,</l>
<l>Or in a comedy-curvet came prancing:</l>
<l>A tragedy each spring, a birth-day ode,</l>
<l>Was all his bus'ness on the Muse's road:</l>
<l>But now, such hurrying, helter-skelter work—</l>
<l>Each cart-horse moves with a genteeler jirk;</l>
<l>So—in a word, your patience not t' abuse,</l>
<l>We've sent our Pegasus to learn of <hi>Hughes.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb n="iv" facs="5"/>
<l>My business here?—Plainly and flatly this—</l>
<l>To beg your Honours not to frown or hiss.</l>
<l>Thalia sent me, and it makes me sad,</l>
<l>For <hi>"entre nous,</hi> (says I) the thing is bad."</l>
<l>"Tut, fool!" the Muse replies—"this powder take,</l>
<l>"Long I've reserv'd it for a last dear stake—</l>
<l>"This powder take—dear Mercury, be quick"—</l>
<l>Here 'tis—a mighty spell, in this slim stick.</l>
<l>Scarce had she left me, when Melpomé came—</l>
<l>"Jove's Messenger, (says she) I'm in a flame!</l>
<l>"I know where Thal' has sent you—never sham it,</l>
<l>"But bribe 'em, God of Thieves! bribe 'em to damn it!"</l>
<l>"No, Madam, damn me, if I do!" I cry'd—</l>
<l>She aim'd a blow, I bow'd, and hither hied.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now for my spell—</l>
<stage>[Blows some powder out of his caduceus.</stage>
<l>There 'tis—I see it spread!</l>
<l>'Tis felt in ev'ry heart—in ev'ry head!</l>
<l>Now shall you fancy character and wit;</l>
<l>Taste in the boxes, humour in the pit.</l>
<l>You'll fancy, friends, that 'tis so droll and funny—</l>
<stage>[To the upper gallery.</stage>
<l>And you, that you've some substance for your money:</l>
<stage>[To the gallery.</stage>
<l>But should the charm dissolve e'er the play ends,</l>
<l>Oh! for Thalia's sake, be yet its friends!</l>

<stage><hi>Mr.</hi> EVERGREEN's</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> DAVID, <hi>preceded by a Lawyer' Clerk.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CLERK.</speaker>
<p>HAS your master breakfasted?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAVID.</speaker>
<p>Preakfasted?—Yes, Sir! Though we live at the court end of the town, we have prought up all our Welch customs. Our master hates Lonton manners, and Lonton laties. What is your pusiness, goot Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLERK.</speaker>
<p>A business he will probably like, though it may concern a London lady. Acquaint him that the writings are engross'd, and that I have brought them, to fill up the blanks, and sign.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAVID.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir;—please to sit, Sir <stage>[going].</stage> The writings imposs'd, and the planks to—What was it, Sir? I must have it wort for wort, for my master is as exact as Shrewspury clock.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
<speaker>CLERK.</speaker>
<p>Acquaint him, friend, that the writings<hi>—the marriage articles,</hi> are ready. I have brought them from Counsellor Bouquet's, to insert the names, and sign and seal.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>[Exit</hi> DAVID, <hi>repeating the message.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CLERK.</speaker>
<p>Now, in the fashionable course of things, how long may it be before I shall draw up the articles of separation for this young couple? It sometimes falls out for the good of the profession, that the happy pair see but one Christmas together. Nay, I have more than once in my time, engross'd the articles of marriage and separation with the same goose quill.</p>
<p>So, here comes the father of the bridegroom, to pore over the writings, I suppose. Come, good, <hi>wary</hi> Sir; if you don't quicken your motions, the young gentleman will excuse your cares;—every movement of that cane speaks a week's delay.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Mr.</hi> EVERGREEN.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Tell Miss Archer to come to me by-and-by. So, Mr. Goose-quill—what—a—are they quite ready?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLERK.</speaker>
<p>Quite ready, Sir;—the names only are wanting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Well, you may add the names in the next room; but I shan't sign 'till I have look'd your parchments cantiously over. No loop-holes for cavils—no expressions that will bear <hi>ingenious</hi> explanations. Defend me from the ingenuity of lawyers!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLERK.</speaker>
<p>You will find all clear, Sir. What are the names?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>That of the lady is Arabella Melville;—mine you know.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
<speaker>CLERK.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir; it is Evergreen; but the gentleman's—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>The gentleman's!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLERK.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir—your son's—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>My son's!!—my son's!!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLERK.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, I know it is Evergreen, junior; but the Christian name. I am sorry to be troublesome; John, Charles—Sir? Henry? George?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Why, thou pen-cutter! art thou come to insult me? <hi>My son! Evergreen, junior!</hi> Why, Sir, <hi>I</hi> am Evergreen, junior, minor, and major; there is but one Evergreen in the world, and I am he.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLERK.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I humbly crave pardon. Are you then the bridegroom?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir. Timothy Evergreen, Esquire, of Rook Hall, in the County of Salop. The bridegroom—aye, to be sure I am. Go, Mr. Feathertip, and leave the blanks as they are—I can fill them up.— <stage>[Exit Clerk.]</stage> Didst ever see such a puppy, David?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAVID.</speaker>
<p>Never, Sir;—not to know that your Honour was the pride! I am sure one shan't see a livelier, puxomer pride in all—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Pride! <hi>Bridegroom—</hi>Taffy!</p>
</sp>

<speaker>DAVID.</speaker>
<p>Got a mercy, Sir! Well, then, the pridegroom; and as for the pridegroomess, she is the sweetest, most innocent, modestest—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Aye, aye, I know how to choose.—Did you tell my young plague, Miss Archer, to come to me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAVID.</speaker>
<p>I tit inteet, Sir; and she bit me carry my Welch face town stairs again in a minute; for that it always made her preakfast sit uneasy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Aye, those women who have fine fortunes, and fine lovers, think they have a right to insult all the world.—She can't spare even me—me, who am her natural guardian, and fifteenth cousin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAVID.</speaker>
<p>Laws, Sir, she makes no more of you than if you were an olt woman, insteat of an antient shentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>An <hi>antient</hi> gent—Oh! in point of family, you mean. Yes, yes,—but this is the last day of her triumph here; I would'nt have her another week in my house, if—</p>

<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Sweet me, no sweets! I have sent five messages to your Ladyship this morning, ere I could have the honor of an interview.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>My <hi>wise</hi> Guardian, then: it was to prepare you a present, my wise guardian, that I staid—a marriage present!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>A present, hey! What is it? what is it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>You are to be married in a day or two, I find, to a young and beautiful girl—it is a present suited to <hi>such</hi> a bridegroom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Let me see it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Shut your eyes then.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[She goes behind him, and puts on a fool's cap with bells.]</stage>

<p>What the devil is it? a wedding nightcap?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Yes, a <hi>night</hi> and <hi>day</hi> cap—'tis yours for ever.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Holding his hands, whilst he shakes his head to get rid of it.]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>I'll teach thee to laugh, Taffy, in a moment. Let go my hands. Take it off, Taf! or I'll make thy sides shake to another tune.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[David snatches the cap, and runs off.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Now, are you not a most ungrateful guardian, to slight my gifts?</p>

<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p><hi>Young</hi> man, I will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>I am, as you say, to be married in a day or two.</p>

<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>David! bring back the cap.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>I have told you these six months to provide yourself with another home;—you now have but six hours to do it in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Why?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Because I would not have my young innocent wife infected by your manners.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>My manners, Sir—What better fate could happen to her? Is she pretty?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>As a young cherub.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Then I'll teach her to captivate the whole town. Why, <hi>I,</hi> Sir—I am not so handsome—that is, not so extremely handsome; yet, with <hi>my manners,</hi> I am every where the object.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>But she shall be an object no where.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCH.</speaker>
<p>But she shall; I'll carry her with me all over the world; I'll teach her the equestrian bow
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
in Hyde Park, and how to dart through the croud in the coffee-room at the Opera. She shall learn—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>She shall learn, that, of all her mischievous hoity-toity sex, you are the last she is to know; and I'll dismiss every servant, that she may never hear your name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>I'll be her bridemaid, and, before she has been your wife six hours, give her more longings for laces, diamonds, feathers, and fops, than can be gratified in six years.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Huh!—h! Why the devil do you not marry yourself, and plague some other man. You have fools enough to choose from—Marry! you have my consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>But I want that of a much more important personage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Whose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>My own. I shall not give up the right of making conquests yet;—when my time comes to retire from the scene of action, I'll pick out the most constant of my adorers, go gravely with him to church, drive soberly to the seat of his ancestors, grow a dutiful wise, study family receipts and made wines; and when I have the honor of seeing your young widow with her <hi>new</hi> husband, we'll drink to your memory in a cup of cowslip of my own brewing</p>

<p>Mr. Calipash a surfeit fever—hum! with the help of bark and aromatics, it may be prolonged three weeks, without injury to the patient.—As to old lady Juniper, frequent visits will be useful,—for in one tapping more she'll come to the dregs; and for my friend, Mrs. Langrish, if I can't prevail on her to prate less, she won't last me another spring.—That woman will talk two hours without breathing, to describe the effects of an emetic; and, if I did not lower her now and then by a gentle cathartic, she'd evaporate through the lingual organs, like air through a cracked bladder.</p>

<p><hi>Coming!</hi> No, poor young fellow, he's going—he's going! there! there's the end of the life of a man of pleasure—it must be very <hi>unpleasant</hi> to be a man of pleasure. Nothing could ever prevail on me to be a man of pleasure.—Oh the temptations that I have withstood, from black eyes and grey, from tall and short!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SERV.</speaker>
<p>I have often thought, Sir,—with submission—that the gentlemen of the wig go through more temptations than people are aware of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="15"/>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Aye, aye,—there are Josephs in the faculty, I can promise ye. Oh! the white hands that I have seen put out between the sarcenet curtains, with pulse disordered only by too much health! Oh the bright eyes that I have seen on snowy pillows! Oh the—but come, the faculty's great faculty is that of keeping secrets—I say no more. Did Mr. Bellair crawl up stairs last night?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SERV.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir; I could not persuade him, when he found Miss Arabella was alone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Aye, he abhors women now—the sight of a young woman throws him into a catalepsy. I have seen him faint only at the touch of Arabella's hand, when she has been chaffing his temples with spirits of hartshorn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SERV.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir. I have sometimes thought he had been bit by some mad woman, and so had a sort of hydrophobia towards the sex. Here's somebody coming.</p>
<stage>[looking through the wing.]</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Ah! I see who it is—you may go.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit Servant.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> EVERGREEN.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Good morning t'ye Doctor! Doctor Feelove, good morning! How are your pulse to day?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Pho! a physician never thinks about his pulse, any more than a lawyer about his conscience; the pocket of the one, and the constitution of the other, both improve by the neglect.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Then why d'ye feel your patient's pulse?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>One can't do less for a guinea.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Well, here are the parchments, <stage>[taking them from his bosom]</stage> here they are! Nothing but names wanting, and sums.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="16"/>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Names, and sums, why are they wanting?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Why, that one may be clear. Your niece has thirty thousand pounds; and you agree that she shall be mine on paying you one-third for your consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>One half.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>No,—one-third. I am sure ten thousand pounds for a simple <hi>aye</hi> is very well; we know a place, where they'd say aye for half the money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Come, don't libel your betters, till you are poor, and want a pension. As to our affair, consider every thing. You know I boarded Arabella, with two sisters, at a village in Cornwall, who could teach her nothing but her sampler; the sole employment of her life, for sixteen years, has been her needle, with the occasional reliefs of making seed-cake, and stewing codlings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>I know all that—I know all that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you know, but you don't draw the inference. Let me tell you that a girl who can't write, who never heard of Point or Brussels; whose only game at cards is <hi>beggar my neighbour;</hi> and who thinks the Play-house, Ranelagh, and Vauxhall, the three great turnpikes to the devil, is a better fortune with <hi>fifteen,</hi> than a town bred miss with <hi>thirty</hi> thousand pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, 'tis in vain to argue. Here take the parchments,—fill up the blanks, and write your name. Shall I see my little Bell?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>To be sure. Call down my Niece. Tell her my Lord Penmanmeaur is here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>How shall we manage when she finds that I am not a lord, and that she will not be a ladyship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Pho! that's easily managed with such
<pb n="11" facs="17"/>
a novice. Tell her that a peerage, like the parliament, lasts but seven years, and that your time is up. Here she comes! so, Arabella, here's his lordship.</p>
</sp>
<stage>ARABELLA <hi>Enters.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>My pretty Bell, my pretty Bell! why so sad?—on the verge of riding under your own coronet,—why so sad?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>I am always sad, I think. They told me, when I left Cornwall, I was coming to London to be very happy, but indeed I was happier there. In the mornings I rambled in the woods, and used to listen to the sweet birds till they made me weep;—in the evenings I walk'd by moonlight.—Oh! how I love moonlight walks! with the distant village sounds dying on the ear, till, like the soft shades of the flowers, they could hardly be distinguish'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Why, you may have moon-light in London, when it is not foggy; and sounds of all sorts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>But my uncle never suffers me to stir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>No, to be sure—not till you are married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>No, nor then neither, without your husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Nor then neither! why they tell me, but I don't care about it, that when I am married I must pay visits, and receive company, and ride in Hyde Park, and be always in public, without once thinking of my husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p><stage>[apart</stage> Doctor! five thousand must be added for that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, hussey!—who has been putting these wicked notions into your head?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="18"/>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Why, sure they can't be wicked, for the Rector's wife and daughters over the way do so; and go out in fine carriages, and have cards on Sundays.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Hussey! hussey! that's a Bishop's family—a parish priest dared not be so wicked for his ears.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Come, doctor, don't be so harsh—my little pet will be a good girl. I have convinced her that she was made on purpose to be my wife; and that it will be the duty of my wife to hate gadding, and particularly to hate all young fellows.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>No—you said <hi>particularly</hi> those with cockades and gorgets.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Did I?—then I was too slack. They are all the same—the gorgeted, the scarf'd, the broad bands, and the narrow bands; if they are young, you must hate them all—and if they presume to talk nonsense to you, make me your secret keeper, and then I shall be able to hold you up, as the exact model of a perfect wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and, like other models, it will be very badly copied. But pray, mistress, in this pretty lesson of your's, where do you find any thing about your visitings, and gadding about, in the libertine stile you were just now speaking of?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>No, no;—no modest woman receives visits from any but relations; nor, amongst those, from none of a remoter degree than uncles and aunts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>What, not a Cousin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Not if it's a male cousin.—Oh horrid! a male cousin in the family of a young married woman is a worse monster than a man-tiger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="19"/>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>But Mr. Bellair is <hi>not</hi> my Cousin,—so I may let him come without any harm:—Oh! how I shall like to support his poor aching head on my bosom; and, when he is fainting, to give him cordials, and weep over him till he recovers.</p>
<stage>[aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>What are you saying, Arabella?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>I was only conning my lesson, Sir; that part of it is so pretty, that, whenever I think on it, I sigh, and feel so melancholy!—and yet 'tis a melancholy sweeter than all the pleasure I have ever tasted.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Aye, go, go! that's my pretty Bell; get it all into your head, and never fear but it will influence your actions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>I must leave ye, or my patients will be impatient.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Well, I shall see you again in the evening; meantime look over the parchments.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>I will. Why, now I have been a fool; I have made the bargain more favourable on his side than I needed. I really believe he would have taken her with the ten thousand only. I'll try to start some difficulty in the business.—I hate to be over-reach'd.</p>

<p>My sickness was assumed not to <hi>captivate,</hi> but to get <hi>introduced</hi> to her. You have often heard that pity is sister to love, and I have <hi>proved</hi> it so, in the heart of the gentle Arabella.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter a Servant, speaking to</hi> BELLAIR.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SERV.</speaker>
<p>Your servant has been here, Sir, to say that Doctor Feelove requests you not to call till one, as he is obliged to make a wide circuit this morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Very well. Bid him let my wrapping gown be ready, with my pale complexion, and all other necessaries. <stage>[Exit servant]</stage> I must have a wider gown; in <hi>that</hi> I am not sufficiently screen'd; who, but a Doctor, could believe that these limbs belong to a fellow in the last stage of an atrophy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Oh, they are so used to wonders, you may make them believe any thing; but have you never yet found a moment to convince <hi>the Lady,</hi> that you have as much health and assurance as any man in town?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Never,—nor do I know that I yet wish it, for I should then lose the luxury of her tender assistances, the soft pressure of her hand, and the tear dropping from her blue eye on my cheek, whilst she believes me in a state of insensibility—How can I bear to give up all that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Faith, I don't know.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Then to hear her sigh, and ask her uncle, in the teaderest accents, <hi>"if nothing can be done for me?"</hi> I swear, a direct avowal of her passion would not give me such transport. How charming! to witness nature's
<pb n="15" facs="21"/>
genuine feelings in a beautiful girl, instead of those factitious ones impos'd by education.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p><hi>Her</hi> mode of education has been strange, sure! do you find nothing repulsive in it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Repulsive! quite the reverse—it has a thousand charms for me. Her mind is naturally so elegant and ingenuous, that the task of polishing it can be but slight, and that charming task will be mine! I shall be her enamour'd Abelard!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Is it so very charming to be a school-master?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>What a phrase! <stage>[impatiently]</stage> To unite the characters of lover and instructor, seems to me the most interesting of human situations.</p>
<l>"What joy to wind along the cool retreat,</l>
<l>"To stop, and gaze on Delia as I go;</l>

<l>"And teach my <hi>lovely scholar</hi> all I know!"</l>
<p>So sung, you know, one of our first poets.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>One of our first poets is very welcome to have sung, or said it. But give me a woman whose soul is <hi>all inform'd,</hi> and alive to every enjoyment of taste and feeling! I would rather my wife should join in conversation with grace, than shrink from it, overpowered by her blushes; and that she should make the men afraid of her wit, rather than allure them by her simplicity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>You speak as though you knew such a woman?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps I may—but of that hereafter.</p>

<p>Hereafter be it then, for now I am impatient to be gone. I must practise an hour, before I

<l>And lily pale his face.—</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>No, to be sure; he is sick, poor man—if he was well 'twould be quite another thing—never let a man in health press your hand. But, as I was saying, I have no doubt but his gratitude will secure us some acknowledgement at his death.</p>

<p>Aye, Sir, but you should always oppose odd fancies.

<p>Aye, he has been but bad, I doubt, but now he pays for all. Come, Sir, cheer ye, cheer ye! <stage>[helping him up.]</stage> I won't leave ye again; I'll sit by ye, if its an hour;—the very sight of a Doctor is better, sometimes, than physic.</p>

<p>Oh, Sir, you are very kind! but I believe I shall not be the better for you now. In the afternoon, if you'll permit me, I shall call again.</p>

</sp>

<p>Where?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>To call on Sir Marvel Mushroom. I pay him a visit once in six months, stay six minutes; and laugh, after I have left him, six hours.</p>

<p>Who the devil is this Sir Marvel, who is such a specific for <hi>ennui?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Been in London a month, and not know Sir Marvel! Why, Sir Marvel was the other day a grocer, or an ironmonger, or a cheesemonger, I don't remember which—near one of the city gates, I don't remember where.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>What is he now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p><hi>Now!</hi> a man of figure, Sir—a man of expence. To be seen every morning in Hyde Park, on a little Galloway, followed by two servants on a brace of hunters. Every noon in a phaeton, making the circuit of St. James's-street, Pall Mall, and the Hay Market; and every night, in every place where a ticket or effrontery can admit him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Well, but where's the peculiarity of all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Oh, all that's nothing—the <hi>captivating</hi> part of the Knight is to come. At the youthful age of forty some relation left him a large estate:—He threw off his apron, drove to his domains in a post chaise <hi>and six,</hi> roasted bullocks, broach'd hogsheads, &amp;c. &amp;c. was next year sheriff for the county, and carried up an address—This accounts for his title.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>His Honour now found it necessary to <hi>read,</hi> on the penalty of being silent wherever he went—to
<pb n="25" facs="31"/>
which his loquacity could not submit. He accordingly buys every author on every subject; peruses poetry, tactics, philosophy, botany, cookery, agriculture; and, to shew that he can read, is for ever quoting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Tiresome enough!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Not at all—as <hi>he</hi> manages, 'tis most pleasant; for beginning to read so late in life, with the <hi>advantage</hi> of a very bad memory, he makes the happiest mistakes imaginable. His head contains an olio of arts and sciences, so mingled and confused that he constantly speaks of one thing for another; and if Boyle or Clarendon are mention'd, ten to one but he'll give ye an old catch as a specimen of their talents.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>His French valet assists in furnishing the inside of his head, as well as to frize the out, and always gives his master the theme for the day.</p>

<p>Aye, but <hi>now,</hi> you know, monsieur, the French are going to follow us<hi>—we</hi> are all the <hi>go</hi> in Paris.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Why now you know, Le Gout, I take great care of your reputation, and form myself entirely on your documents. You have liv'd so long with dukes and lords, and noble cricketers, and gentlemen chessplayers, that you know the dash of high life exactly; and if I had a son, I would prefer you to any French governor in London.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LE GOUT.</speaker>
<p>Oh, as to dat, monsieur, I would not be French governor to any ting. Running about after little master—sitting behind him at de play, and vid my

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Well but, monsieur, have you thought of a subject for me to day—You can't conceive how brilliant I was at Mrs. Flanconade's yesterday. She thought to pose me once, and interrupted me with <stage>(speaking in a thick voice.)</stage> "Pray, Sir Marvel Mushroom, at what time was the Roman republic in it's glory?" Very good, ma'am, says I—very good! as tho' all the world did not know the republic was in it's greatest lustre when Alexander the Great was king at Rome—ha, ha, ha! No conceiving how it was enjoy'd—ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Was not that the lovely Bab Archer, you bowed to, as we came in?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>It was Miss Archer; but you don't think her handsome?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="29" facs="35"/>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Critically so—perhaps not; but she is <hi>more—</hi>she is <hi>captivating!</hi> Her voice is melody; and there is elegant mind in every motion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p><hi>Elegant</hi> mind, do you call it? I am sure her's is a most insolent one.—I knew her abroad; and this woman, who in your opinion is made up of melody, sweetness, and witchery, is the most perverse, the most capricious, the most proud, the—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Tut! tut! that is to say, you have been her slave, and a <hi>neglected</hi> one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Faith, there is hardly a man of your acquaintance who will not subscribe to my opinion of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>The strongest proof of her charms, and of her power. I adore her for being hated by all the men who have had the presumption to sigh for her. There is a degree of impurity in a woman who smiles on, and listens to, all who choose to make love to her. When I marry, my wife must bring me an ear as unessayed as her heart; and the first whispers of love that reach her, must be from my lips.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Well, carry your whispers to Miss Archer, kneel, sigh, weep, and—be despised!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>What do you laugh at?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>At your conceiving that, with a woman of <hi>her</hi> character, I should pursue so <hi>beaten</hi> a track. No, no; I have resolv'd to woo her, but it shall be by an appearance of indifference. I'll set her heart in a blaze by my coldness, and conquer her with slights.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Why your way of love making is more singular than mine; but as to its success, I should as soon

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Enough! did you come from the country, Mr. Bellair?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>From Leyden.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Leyden! you came from Leyden—ah! I remember, that's the place where they are so famous for lead mines.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>There is no standing this. <stage>[to Carlton.]</stage> You have good paintings, Sir Marvel.</p>
<stage>[looking round.]</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I flatter myself I have taste that way. We have moderns who pretend to paint—ha, ha!—save us from modern painters!—the antique is the thing! Now, for a portrait painter, there's nobody like that little droll fellow, Erasmus; he gave us flesh and blood to the life!—But for a cabinet piece, give me a Dutch Fair by Scipio Africanus. What is he laughing at? he behaves very oddly!</p>
<stage>[to Carlton.]</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>You must excuse him—unhappily ignorant—has read nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! I'll offer him my library. My
<pb n="31" facs="37"/>
dear Sir, you'll pardon me; but one can make no figure without reading. In such a place as Leyden, you can have had no opportunities—My library is at your service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>You do me a most particular favour, Sir Marvel. Well chosen, I am sure it must be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, as to that—yes, yes, Sir—aye, Mr. Carlton, you have seen my library. All the poets from Mecaenas to Shaftsbury. All the dramatic writers of name—including Shakespear, Lycurgus, and Pliny.—Read <hi>well,</hi> Sir; and after you have read, begin to write.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Write!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes; one is not finish'd without it—every body writes. One cannot put one's head into company without meeting half a dozen ode-writing misses, and matrons who compose essays—but satire is my forte.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>What then <hi>you</hi> write, Sir Marvel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Trifles! trifles! There is a thing of mine in the papers to-day. You know, for every body knows, Miss Archer?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Doubtless.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>You know she is the most haughty, affected creature living; and to-day I gave her in doggerel—mark that—in <hi>doggerel;</hi> heroic verse would have been too dignified for the subject. There she is, in the poet's corner, at full length.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Satirize Miss Archer!—surely you have not dared.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Yes I have. Why not satirize Miss Archer? I satirize myself sometimes, and answer it again the next day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="32" facs="38"/>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>By Heaven! on reflection, it pleases me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Besides, to tell you the truth, there is another reason—Now I shall surprise ye, I know;—I hardly expect ye to believe me—but—in short, she has actually refused <hi>me!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Refused you! Nay then, Carlton, you may as well give it up—You'll hardly expect to succeed where Sir Marvel has failed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I don't know that—I don't know that; those capricious women generally choose the worst—You know the proverb—dainty dogs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Delicate! So 'tis revenge, then—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Yes, revenge—But I still continue to visit her in a friendly way; for she's fashionable, and one finds the first dash there: Besides, I have such good-nature and generosity about me, that I never can be out of humour with people to their faces.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>In course, you don't mean to acknowledge your satire. But is it very severe?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, tears her like a bramble bush.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Then do me the favour to give <hi>me</hi> for the author.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Most particularly so:—In short, I want to be introduced to her, and I know no better way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Tell her he is dying for her—that's a better way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Yes, to be made a fool. Will you oblige me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>To be sure—Gad, I shall like such a screen! for I have had the terror of her fingers before my eyes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="33" facs="39"/>

<p>What is your motive for reading it to <hi>me?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Motive—motive—why 'tis fit every body should know what's said of them. That great philosopher, <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> said the abuses of his enemies were more serviceable to him than the praises of his friends.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>I am quite of that opinion, and wish therefore, to know whom I have to thank for <hi>this</hi> service.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>Perfectly well. I will not give his name, but if you have any curiosity, he shall receive your thanks in person this evening.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>I should like it above all things. I have spent a life in hearing flatteries and falsehoods—let me for once see a man who has the courage to speak what he thinks. Pardon me for leaving you—I shall expect you and my panegyrist at <hi>seven.</hi></p>

<p>Yes, yes, she feels it.—I am not surprised at it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>

<p>Oh, vile! tho' I made <hi>her</hi> believe I thought it all wit and poignancy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Why really, Miss Juvenile, I am surprised that people will give opinions so rashly. Miss, the person who wrote this little <hi>morceau</hi> is remarkable for his skill in <hi>belles lettres.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p><hi>Belles lettres!—</hi>skill in <hi>bell metal</hi> might do for such lines as these—they might be hammer'd out of any thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Very well, ma'am! very well! I must beg leave to say, that it is not so agreeable to hear the talents of one's friends slighted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! you are mighty liberal;—in general 'tis the most agreeable treat a friend can

have. I wish you wou'd let me know who this friend is, for whose reputation you are in such pain.</p>

<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>What do I think? ha, ha, ha!—My dear Sir Marvel!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if you wont believe me, come this evening and see him here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Well, really now, it is surprising!—I did not think he had possess'd so much ill-nature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Ill-nature! Let me tell you, Miss Juvenile, private ill-nature may be a public good. To make people's time pass happily is very benevolent, and if it was not for a little pleasant thing of this sort, now and then in a morning, people's chocolate would be as dull and infipid as the Ve—Venetian black broth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Spartan, I fancy you mean.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Spart—gad! that's very true; what a ridiculous mistake!—ha, ha, ha! Thank ye, Miss—thank ye. Yes, I remember now, the Venetians were those who joined the Macedonians in the war against Philip;—how could I make such a mistake!—ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>

<stage>Carlton and Bellair arise from a table with glasses, &amp;c.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>And so you really mean to persuade the
<pb n="39" facs="45"/>
innocent thing, that running away with <hi>Harry Bellair</hi> is the most honourable step she can take?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>At least the happiest; for does she not love me? What is her fate if she stays? She will be huddled, in less than three days, into a marriage, with a passion in her heart, adding bitterness to disgust and mortification.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Where would you place her to be in safety?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>I have a friend in town, the gravity of whose character will be a shield to her's. I have neglected him since I came from Leyden, but I'll go and make it up with him this very day. Let that pass—now to my question; will you assist in the <hi>enlevement?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>If I am not summon'd to the adorable Archer. If my scheme there takes place—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>That's really too absurd! If she believes you to be the author of that vile abuse, and invites you, it must be to poison you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>I don't care with what <hi>view</hi> it is, if I am but invited;—I shall be sure, at least, not to rank with the brilliant captains, the Sir Tommys, and Sir Neddys, who are receiv'd, court'sey'd to, and forgot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>No, you'll certainly be remember'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>I am convinced that a woman who has been admired all over Europe, and returns with an untouch'd heart, is not to be won by flattery, or by stooping to her power. 'Tis <hi>pride</hi> secures her, and her pride must be taken down, before Love can find a vulnerable place for his darts.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I found her as inflammable as one of Montgolfier's balloons. The whole town had been with her—the whole town is mad about my satire!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Then 'tis in vain for me to hope for the credit of being it's author—it is not in mortal wight to lend so much reputation, for half an hour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, but you are mistaken—I disclaim'd it—disclaim'd all the glory—and she desires this evening to see the incomparable author.—So you will, Pyramus like, drive, for one day, the chariot of the Sun.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Shall I?—will she see me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>She pants for an interview: the beauteous Helen was not more desirous of receiving Leander, when he swam every night-across the Mediterranean. I have promised to carry you this evening. But be sure you don't give me as the poet, 'till I give the word.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="41" facs="47"/>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Nothing can be farther from my design—You shall gather your laurels when you please. I prize this mode of introduction so highly, that I know not how to return the favour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Lord, nothing can be so easy. I hear you have a pretty poetical quill, and that you sometimes write Latin verses;—publish a volume, and call it mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>I'll consider it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>You may throw in a touch of Greek, too. I should learn Greek, for the pleasure of reading Ovid, but their d—d crooked characters are so alike, that one may as well attempt to learn Spanish, of Dutch mackerel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>My dear friend, I am too impatient to give the time I ought to your erudition;—I had rather hold a convention with my taylor and valet than with Ovid and Horace; and had rather this night be as well drest as <hi>Count Grammont,</hi> than as well read as <hi>Doctor Johnson.</hi></p>

<p>Dear me, how can you think so? Spiders are frightful creatures, but young men are not frightful. When my uncle took me out in his chariot, they looked at me so kindly! If I had been their sister, they could not have seemed to like me better.</p>

<p>No, they would not then have liked you so well. But you are very ignorant, Bell; very ignorant, indeed! However, you have time enough to improve.—When you are Lady Penmanmaure, you'll be quite a different thing. Good by'e, pretty Bell! you shall see me again to-night.</p>

<p>Of that delightful age which women term childish, and which girls think <hi>womanish;—</hi>she is the niece of an eminent physician; and the man, to whom he is going to marry her, is a superannuated peer.</p>

<p>Why do you whistle, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Oh, nothing, nothing. 'Tis a droll story you tell me—that's all. And pray how did you get acquainted with the young woman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>I saw her with her uncle in Hyde Park—was struck with the air of innocence, and <hi>enquiry</hi> that distinguished her—followed the carriage—learnt that she was just brought from Cornwall, to be married to a gouty Lord—introduced myself as a patient—robb'd the niece of her heart, and let the uncle rob me of my guineas.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Well done, uncle Toby!—wise uncle Toby! Gad, there's something very odd in all this! And you are going to carry her off to-night?</p>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<p>Well, I shall take it d—d ill, if you carry her any where else.</p>

<p>There is not another house in London I would trust her in.</p>

Oh, a d—d old fool of a Doctor!

<stage><hi>[Miss</hi> ARCHER <hi>discovered with a Harp, on which she strikes a few notes. A rapping is heard—she rises with precipitation.]</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>MY sweet harp, I must abandon thee! That rap announces my satyrist. Ha, ha! Now, I really wonder, though I wish to see <hi>him,</hi> how he can look <hi>me</hi> in the face:—he must be most ridiculously confused—trying at fifty awkward apologies. Oh, it is Miss Juvenile—impatient, I suppose, to see <hi>the bard.</hi></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Miss</hi> JUVENILE, <hi>speaking eagerly.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Bless me, is he gone! I run away the moment we rose from table. I would not have miss'd him for the world.—Who would have expected him to be gone so soon? Not eight yet.</p>
<stage>[Looking at her watch.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p><hi>Who,</hi> indeed? But people's fears, when they dread <hi>great</hi> misfortunes, are generally unruly. Why, my dear Ma'am, you'll be happy yet—The charming man who lash'd me has <hi>not</hi> been here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, that's lucky! I do want much to see what sort of a man he is.—She shan't know that I could tell her.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="52" facs="58"/>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I can draw his picture, I am sure, exactly. A great fat man, in a black coat, with twinkling eyes, and a prodigious length of profile—he makes amazing low bows—sits down, with his hat resting on his knees; and after wiping his face, stuffs his red and white pocket handkerchief in the crown of it.</p>

<p>Sir Marvel Mushroom, and another Gentleman.</p>

<stage><hi>They enter—</hi>CARLTON <hi>speaking without.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! my dear Sir Marvel, that was in the very first style. Do you know—Ladies, your most obedient! <stage>[passing them with a sliding bow]</stage>—Do you know the very thing happened to me at Padua! Miss Archer, I am happy to wait on you.—We were all in the Marchezza's box that night, when her husband came from Paris—she is extremely handsome; he <hi>toute au contrarie!</hi> but, notwithstanding—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Bless me, can't you tell your story afterwards? Let me introduce you to Miss Archer. This, Madam, is the gentleman who had honour to day to entertain the town with—with that little—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Oh, a mere trifle! not worth mentioning, Sir Marvel. Miss Archer, I hear you have been a traveller; and that, when in Italy, they persuaded you to visit some of the Levant Islands. I wonder, when so far, your taste did not carry you to Greece! You can conceive nothing so charming as the Grecian women!—nothing so interesting as their style of living!—you would have found all Arcadia realiz'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="53" facs="59"/>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Greece and Arcadia!—are these his apologies!—his aukward embarrassments!</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>I endeavoured to persuade a fair Greek, that the fate of my countrywomen was happier than their's.—"Oh, it is impossible," said she; "their liberty makes them <hi>capricious,</hi> and their power over the men <hi>assuming;</hi> they grow old in planning new conquests, and, alive <hi>only</hi> to the pleasure of admiration, seldom taste the exquisite bliss of true passion." I felt the force of her observation, and could not help confessing that it <hi>was possible</hi> for a handsome English woman to border on the ridiculous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage> So! that's tolerably home.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage> I am petrified! he talks with as much self-possession as he would to a maiden aunt—no bearing this!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>So you will not know me, Mr. Carlton?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Miss Juvenile!—'tis no wonder I did not immediately recollect you in that dress, when I left you in a white frock. I saw your brother well at Vienna. You play, Miss Archer. I am charm'd that you prefer the harp—'tis so graceful for the lady—so advantageous for the voice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p><stage>[In a pet]</stage> Why 'tis downright jingle!—a wooden cimbal is a better thing! I thought to have heard nothing but what concern'd my ver—I mean your verses; and here you have whisk'd us to Padua, then to Greece, then we had a swing to Vienna in Turkey, and now we must have a Canterbury tale about the merits of the Welch harp. Why, I tell you, Miss Archer, <hi>this</hi> is the gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Miss Archer, <hi>this</hi> is the gentleman,
<pb n="54" facs="60"/>
who travell'd all over Europe, to qualify himself to write an epigram on you;—I think he might have managed the matter without going so far for his wit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>If he got his wit far off, you must allow it touches <hi>home.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Yes;—I allow it is <hi>homely</hi> wit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Heavens! how could this man! <stage>[aside]</stage> Miss Juvenile means to be severe upon you, Sir, but don't be disheartened. When you have done with me, you'll find a number of innocent, unprotected characters, who, at no other expence than a private <hi>heart-ache,</hi> may be securely offered up victims to your muse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Madam, I disclaim all connection with the muses—nothing inspires me but the subject.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>You were happy in the choice of a subject to day; was he not, my dear? Have you the paper about you, Sir Marvel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Yes, to be sure—here it is.</p>
<stage>[Offering it to Miss Juvenile.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me! I am not yet so harden'd a writer, as to stand the reading of my own works.</p>
<stage>[Snatches the paper with anger, and puts it in his pocket.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage> Now, would I give the world to know, if that is in compassion to his own feelings, or to mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Bless me, Sir! not hear your own works! Why, it is what every body does, and read 'em too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Aye, to be sure—the ladies carry their's about in their netting cases, and the men in their toothpick cases.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Yes, indeed;—we learn those kind of
<pb n="55" facs="61"/>
works now, like every other, at boarding school. I, myself, have written five odes, seven epigrams, and an elegy on an old turkey cock. Come, read, Mr. Carlton—you'll give your satire new points.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>These wretches will force me to spoil my plan, by their cruelty to the lovely sufferer.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>May I be permitted to ask, how <hi>I</hi> came to have the honour of your poetical notice?—Did I ever offend you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Never, Madam! with respect to me, you have been perfectly harmless.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Would I had not! for the first time in my life I <hi>wish</hi> to do mischief.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>I never had the honour of your acquaintance; and have seen you but seldom in public; but last spring I particularly remember, at the Pantheon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>That's well! <hi>particularly</hi> remember!</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>It was impossible to forget it;—you had in your party so lovely a girl! Bright blue eyes, flaxen tresses, elegant shape, modest—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Impatiently]</stage> What has all this to do with your satire on me, Sir? Why have you taken pains to represent me to the world in so odious a light?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Faith, Madam, one does many things without reflection. I happened to be in the humour to write—Your name occurred—The thing was done—My friends liked it—They would have it appear. I'll give you leave to abuse me with fifty times the wit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Fifty times as much wit! gad! I don't know where she'd find it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Then you do not think me, Sir, so very—I understand, you do not think me so extremely odious and frightful!</p>
<stage>[In great confusion.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="56" facs="62"/>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Oh, that submissive look! such another will bring me at her feet, and then I am undone.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Do you hear, Mr. Carlton? is the lady so very odious, and frightful?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Frightful! Oh, no, Madam. The lady is very well—I wish I had abated a point or two in my epigram. She is tolerably fair, not a very bad shape, and, upon the whole, a—a most bewitching creature.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Bless me, Sir, do you think I can stand here to be analyzed in this manner? Pardon me, if I say you scarcely keep within the line of good manners. I did not expect—not that I care.—I would not have you think that—that—I can bear it no longer.</p>
<stage>[Bursts into tears and exits.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Oh, those tears! that I could catch them, and bury them in my heart!</p>
<stage>[Aside, looking after her.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!—well, she's finely mortified. My dear Mr. Carlton, I have the most extreme favour to beg of you.</p>

<p>My dear Ma'am, I really—</p>

<p>Nay, I will not be denied.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, get that one thing published, by all means.</p>

<p>To oblige you, Sir Marvel.</p>

<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, charming!—I'll bring it to you myself to-morrow. Now I'll go to Miss Archer, and tell her you are going home to compose another satire on her.</p>

<stage>[Exit.</stage>

<p>Go, thou <hi>thing!</hi> and prosecute my heart's dearest interests, whilst you believe yourself only gratifying your girlish spite!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>In the midst of all Miss Archer's anger, she does not pretend to despise the verses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Despise them! I design to make her acknowledge that they are the happiest verses that ever were written;—you have really very extraordinary talents.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Talents!—aye, but every body thinks he has talents now-a-days! as Homer says in the Rape of the Lock,</p>
<l>To wit each blockhead makes pretence;</l>

<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Mighty pretty! mighty pretty! I can never come <hi>in</hi> to my house, but I am jostled by two or three young fellows going <hi>out</hi> of it. Hark ye, Sir! In future when any body, male or female, asks for Miss Archer, say she's not at home. If I can't get her out of the house, she shall see nobody in it—that will surely do in the long run. She may live without a husband, but to live without gossiping, without flatterers, without all the <hi>he and she</hi> family of nonsense, that I take to be impossible. D'ye mind me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAVID.</speaker>
<p>Yes sure I to, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="58" facs="64"/>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Well then, mind me again. Mr. Bellair will bring a lady here presently—tell him I am out—sent for by the Welch Committee, about the new linen manufactory;—but say I left strict orders with the housekeeper to take care of the lady.</p>

<speaker>DAVID.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I shall, Sir.</p>

<stage>[Exit.</stage>

<p>Aye, aye—they are together by this time, driving to me, their only friend and guardian! ha, ha, ha! I saw the dog watching the door, and I saw him hold up a lantern—that was the signal, I suppose, ha, ha, ha!—Pretty creatures! Oh, I have them fast—they have made a noose for their own necks. Of an unfortunate man, I am surely the most fortunate that ever.</p>

<p>My dearest angel 'tis unfortunate; but you are now in the house of Mr. Evergreen, and his protection will be of the most conclusive sort, with respect to your reputation; and <hi>your</hi> reputation is now mine. Why do you sigh?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>I don't know—but I am afraid they'll take me from you again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Never; I swear by every thing sacred, that I'll hold you to me as I would my life. I'll go directly down to the house to bring home my friend; I cannot bear that you should be in this unguarded slate, and for many reasons I ought not to remain with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Not remain with me! why are we not to be married?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Doubtless! and then we shall be inseperable;
<pb n="59" facs="65"/>
but custom says we must not be so 'till we are married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Why, how will custom know any thing about us?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Well, if you must leave me, make haste to return. How shall I amuse myself in your absence? Oh, here are some paintings. I love paintings dearly—I can look at them and make out whole conversations, between unhappy girls, and their cross uncles, and fathers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>But look <hi>now,</hi> my angel, for another subject—search for the portrait of a lover; fancy him telling the beauty he adores, that his whole life is devoted to her felicity;—fancy that I am that lover, and yourself the charming girl. <stage>[kissing her hand]</stage> Heaven guard thee!</p>

<p>Oh, Bell! Bell! have I not always told you to beware of young men? have I not told you that they are all made up of deceit and lies?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you have told me so, but I don't believe you. And you told me that I was made on purpose to be your wife, and that I don't believe neither.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! why, who then are you made for?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Somebody.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but not for the body you think of, my pretty Bell. Oh, you little goose you! why this was a scheme plan'd between Bellair and me. This is my house; and he has brought you here, to deliver you solely into my power.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Oh, what a story! how can you say such false things? he'd die before he'd put me in your power.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Would he so? why I have been in his secret the whole time. I know of his sham sickness to impose on your wise uncle, and of his persuading you that he had a godfather, under whose care he would place you. I know of the signal of the dark lantern, and every particular about ye—Now what do you think of <hi>young men?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Think! oh merciful! I could not have believ'd that in all the world there had been such—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Aye, <hi>now,</hi> are they not deceitful monsters? and Bellair in particular, is he not—tell me? <stage>[snatching her hand]</stage> is he not the worst of men?—a most cruel villain?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="61" facs="67"/>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>What for putting me in your power?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>No, no, no,—I mean for—'Gad she had me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Yes, it is very cruel indeed. I think <hi>now</hi> I could hate him. Oh, I wish he would come, that I might tell him how I hate him!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Aye, but he won't come—or, if he does, it will be to no purpose; he shall never see you more, my pretty Bell, 'till you are my wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>If I was sure it would make him miserable, I could almost determine to be your wife—and yet I would rather die.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you ungrateful baggage! so much love, so much tenderness as I have thrown away upon you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Its very strange! I would help it if I could, but indeed I cannot. He who has been so cruel, I cannot hate; and you, who have been so kind, I cannot love.</p>

<p>Why should I deceive you?—you think Mr. Bellair very wicked in deceiving me, and pretending to love me, when he did not. I will not pretend to love you; if I did, you ought to think me a very wicked girl.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>So, so, so. Well, Ma'am, with regard to the matter of love, we'll settle that hereafter;—perhaps we are more even <hi>there</hi> than you think for—but, at present, I have other business in hand. Here, Mrs. Jones, <stage>[Enter Housekeeper]</stage> take care of this young lady;—tempt her to eat if you can, and if you cannot, put her to bed supperless.</p>

<p>Oh, Ma'am, you seem good-natured, and I'll tell ye. Mr. Bellair has betrayed me, and Lord Penmanmawr is determined to marry me.</p>

<p>Who are these people?—I never heard their names.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Heavens! run away with a man to marry him, and not know where he lives! why, my dear, he may be a deceiver.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Yes, so he is, a very great deceiver; for he brought me here to Lord Panmanmawr, and call'd him Mr. Evergreen;—and now he won't marry me himself, and wants to force me to marry the old lord. <stage>[Weeping.</stage></p>

<stage>speaking to a Servant without.</stage>
<p>Gone! gone! gone off! I can't believe it—'tis impossible. She knows nobody—speaks to nobody. In all this vast town there cannot be a house open to her.

<p>Aye, here's a fine pill for ye, Doctor!—here's a bitter potion! Whilst you have been running after an old woman's sciatica at Hampstead, your niece has been running away with a young man.</p>

<p>Her reputation is yet unblemished, Sir.</p>

<p>Yes, but it won't be so to-morrow morning—the first sun beams will see the flies upon it, and by noon it will be stale—stale, Doctor!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, Sir! this is going too far;—you are too violent in your conjectures;—after all it may be but a girl's frolic—stray'd to some toyshop, or confectioner's, perhaps.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Toyshop! or confectioner's! <stage>[contemptuously]</stage> What, then, you have not found out, all this time, that she is really run off with a young fellow, and who her gallant is! whu! have I that news to tell you? come, Doctor, prepare for a surprize—loosen your neckcloth, take off your wig, slacken all your ligatures, and sit down for a fit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Angrily]</stage> Slacken your wit, Sir! you are too jocose on the subject of a young lady's reputation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Young <hi>lady</hi>'s repution! there are more reputations than her's at stake, I promise ye;—the reputation of a wise man—a <hi>Doctor</hi>'s reputation, will become the tennis ball of all the wits in town in a few hours. Oh, Doctor, Doctor! where did you take up your diploma for discretion?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Sir! there is no bearing—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but there is—Hark ye! I shall make ye, in one minute, as mute as the bust of old Galen in your study. This great, impudent, roaring, debauch'd fellow, who has carried off your niece without let or hindrance, is the poor puling patient, who was brought to your house every day for the benefit of the park air; and whom you have pronounced to be beyond

the skill of all the physicians in Europe, to keep out of a winding sheet.—Now, Doctor, you find there are more reputations than your niece's at stake.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>A malicious invention of your own—sheer malice!—That poor young gentleman is in a state, and I will prove it, to make it impossible for him to recover.

<p>Sir! Mr. Bellair—Sir!—</p>

<p>He does not know ye—fear nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Are you sure of that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>My patient, Sir—good gentlemen speak! how is my patient?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Your patient, Sir, is as well as a patient can be, who is out of the reach of his d—d Doctor. No further occasion for asses milk, stimulatives, balsamics, or coolers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor Doctor!—no more fees—he has given you the <hi>go-by</hi> fairly. Is it not a shame that a man of your prowess in the fields of Galen, should not be able to conquer such a pitiful hectic as drove him him out of the world? why, a physician ought to have the diseases at his call, and whistle them on and off, as a huntsman does his hounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Aye, 'twas a crying sin, to let such a spirited fine young fellow be kick'd out of life by a rascally little feveret! An old woman would have cured him; but such an obstinate confidence in the skill of the renown'd Doctor Feelove! He died full of resentment, and his last words were—"Toss the Doctor in a blanket."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>I can forgive that—I can forgive that—but I can't forgive your illiberality, Sir. An old woman cure him! It was not in the power of all the physicians between London and the Alps to cure him;—not an herb, gum, wood, or fungus in the whole medicopeia, that could have given him breath two days longer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>'Tis false, Sir—Bring the blanket!</p>
</sp>

<p>I could not bear this treatment, Sir, but that the extreme satisfaction I have in Mr. Bellair's death.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Satisfaction!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir. My reputation, my character, demanded that he should die.—I would not have had him alive to-morrow morning for a thousand pound fee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>This is amazing!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, there is a vile story in circulation, which, if true, would sink me beneath the lowest med'cine grinder—beneath a mixer of eggs and turpentine—beneath the cork in a julep bottle; nothing less than that Bellair is in perfect health, and so alive to youth and beauty, as to have run away with my niece—they say <hi>that!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>What is there this world will not say! By all the honour of physic, he has a dose in his pocket to have secured his reputation, had he found thee alive!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Apart]</stage> We'll search him, and make him swallow it. But have you then lost the young lady?—is she gone?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Gone, Sir—absolutely gone; but as my poor patient is gone too, I am in some measure reconciled to that event. But, bless me, Sir, you are vastly like him—a man more liable to be imposed on, might take ye both for the same person;—the same voice, and the same features, only fresher and plumper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Oh, oh—What you have found me out, Doctor? Why, I am his brother—your poor patient's younger brother,—and I should break my heart for his death, only the dog has left me a clear estate of two

thousand a year, to buy weepers. In short, Doctor, I greatly fear'd your skill would preserve him, and if it had!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Preserve him! you might as well have expected my skill in physic to have preserv'd the French bank from breaking.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Well, notwithstanding my affected petulance at your entrance, I am highly gratified that Bellair is where he is—and I'll recommend you to all my friends and acquaintance. But I wonder the loss of your niece sits so lightly, my little Hippocrates.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, I have a great heart—a prodigious great heart! its feelings are for the faculty. A girl may run away from an uncle without reproach to him; but when a patient runs away from the sentence of his physician, the reputation of the doctor must soon run after him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Happily <hi>our</hi> patient knew his duty better;—and so, as we are now three very happy fellows, let us e'en adjourn to the Star and Garter, and live the evening like <hi>bon vivants.</hi></p>

<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart;—and egad, gentlemen, I am so offended with the insolence of a certain person, whom I will not name, that if you'll discover my niece, I'll give her to ye, with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds. The odd ten I'll stick to.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>With as much confidence, as on the

<p>Bravo, Doctor! keep to that, and we'll discover her enchanted castle, never fear!</p>

<p>How! if I discover your niece, drag her from her seducer, and in that state of her reputation take her off your hands, and make her <hi>Mistress</hi> Evergreen—what will you not throw in five thousand for that?</p>

<p>Here! here's an unreasonable man! So then, if I discover, and marry her, I am to have only fifteen thousand pounds!—Oh Lord! oh Lord!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Fifteen thousand pounds! why you shan't have her at all. Fifteen thousand pounds! If I thought my niece would ever look upon thee, or ever think of thee as a husband, I'd put fifteen thousand pounds in each pocket, drive to Gravesend, and leap into the sea, to disappoint thee.</p>

<p>Here, here's a Welch riding-cloak, that belonged to a tall, meagre aunt of mine; 'tis a little too long, I believe; but it will conceal you the better.

<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Aye, I saw the chaise at the door—shall I go and break the axle, or shoot the horses?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>No, no—put on this cloak <stage>[taking it from the ground]</stage>—ride with him a few miles, then turn upon him, and terrify him to death. I suppose your vis-a-vis is waiting; I'll use it, to convey her out of his reach—instantly—instantly!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Stop! <stage>[when the cloak is half on]</stage> Hold! I will not be envelop'd in this new-fashion'd chemise—how could I be such a good-natur'd fool? Have you not repuls'd me, Madam—disdain'd me?</p>

<p>Oh, my dear Sir Marvel! consider, 'tis for this young lady—she has not repuls'd you.</p>

<p>I'm at one word—off it goes, unless you'll promise to receive me on terms.</p>
</sp>

<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Oh heavens! I—I—I'll do better; I'll introduce you on terms to the pretty widow, Lady Beauville—she's just becoming the rage—'twill be infinite eclat—she had all the men in the pit about her t'other night at the opera.</p>

Come, I say! <stage>[Takes Sir Marvel's hand, who goes a step or two, and then stops.]</stage> Why d'ye stop, child—go you must and shall, so loitering will have no effect, but to make me angry. Come, I say—nay, if you will be pull'd, you shall be pull'd <stage>[Pulls and pushes him].</stage> Zounds! you are strong, Bell; I have heard that the Cornish girls can wrestle, and I fancy you have practis'd the sport. Nay, if you are for that, Miss—here, David, come and help pull this young lady into the chaise.</p>

fifty grenadiers, and when they come to town, they mince their words, and mince their steps, as though they could utter nothing but monosyllables, or step above two inches. Come, we'll have t'other tug, Miss—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Will you? <stage>[Raises the hood, and looks, first at one, then at the other].</stage> Now, Mr. Evergreen, we'll have a tug, or a wrestle, or what you please.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Where? why, they are in the mode, that's all—emigrating. No, you don't pass this streight—you don't indeed; I'll defend it as the Africans did Thermopylae.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p><hi>You,</hi> Sir! how dare you take this liberty in my house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Come, Sir, don't be obstreperous: if you are, I'll clothe <hi>you</hi> in the riding-hood, and cram you into the post-chaise, as you would have done me; you won't play the Cornish romp as manfully as I did.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Sir, this insolence—</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if you will have a tug, you shall have a tug— <stage>[Scuffle to get on the cloak, Evergreen gets off at last].</stage> Here, then, I remain conqueror; but whether the game is Olympic, Isthmian, or Irish, I know not. But Lady Beauville!—to be enroll'd in her suit, and in the Mennil hunt, is all that remains to establish me—fate can do no more! Miss Archer will now be a friend indeed! Oh, Pylades, as Juvenal says, what's life without a friend?—its a dumpling without egg.</p>

<p>My dear Madam, on some occasions not to have presumption would be ungrateful.—I should really be ashamed if at this moment I did not give you reason to believe that I have as much presumption as any unmarried gentleman in town.</p>

<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Intolerable! Why do you take such liberties with me, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Why do you take such liberties with me? You have taken the liberty to intrude yourself into my thoughts without my desiring it; you have taken the liberty to obtrude yourself on my dreams—sleeping or waking, I am never free from you. If I mean to be civil to another woman, your image pops itself before me, and steals the compliment for which she was preparing her smiles—Talk of liberties, indeed!</p>

<p>Bend your eyes on me, sweet creature, that I may interpret them.</p>

<p>I don't know what <hi>I</hi> ought to suppose, Sir.</p>

<p>You ought to suppose that you are lovely, and that I have eyes:—you ought to suppose that you have a charming spirit, and that I have a heart:—you ought to suppose that you are captivating, and that I am your slave.

<p>Zounds! Miss Archer here again! Nay, then she's my own—it would be ridiculous to <hi>affect</hi> displeasure now. <stage>[Goes towards her, then stops.]</stage> No, faith—she shall speak first;<hi>—I</hi>'ll be courted this time.</p>
<stage><hi>[Sits down again; Miss</hi> ARCHER <hi>not observing him, he begins to sing, to catch her attention.]</hi></stage>
<p>"I've kiss'd and I've prattled</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Screams.]</stage> This is beyond all bearing!</p>
<stage>[Rushing out.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>It would, indeed, if I suffered you to go;—No, no, dear creature! we shan't part now as we did in the morning:—I have just been at your guardian's, to tell you that I forgive all your ill behaviour to-day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Forgive!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Aye, you may well wonder—'tis more than one in ten would do. Come, come—lower the scorn of that brow, and hear reason.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>I'll hear nothing, Sir, and I insist on your leaving this house instantly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!—that's unreasonable, considering where you are. But, come! I'll allow you half a dozen ill-humoured things, and then you shall attend to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Seeming to bite her tongue with vexation.]</stage> I <hi>will</hi> have my my own way in something—I
<pb n="89" facs="95"/>
won't say <hi>one</hi> ill-humour'd thing, though I feel a thousand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>A thousand! Well, we have time before us, charmer; you shall have opportunities enough—every morning at breafast—every day at dinner—every—</p>
<stage>[With affected melancholy.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>What can the monster mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Mean! why to marry you, Petulance! to give you a right to plague me for ever. What an acquisition, for a woman of spirit! Oh, I feel already the horrors of my future fate, but I am resolv'd to go through it—I <hi>will</hi> go through it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>You imagine that the whimsicalness of this must excuse its freedom, Mr. Carlton, but be assured—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Pho, pho, don't let us waste time;—the plain English of our situation is this;—you are a coquette, and I am a man of the world; you would like to make me act like a fool, and I am determined to make you act like a woman of sense—a proof that I am the best Christian.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Very well, Sir—very well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>I admired you, the first moment I beheld you, but resolv'd not to be made a dangler—which, if I had approach'd you in the common modes of courtship, would have inevitably followed.—I, therefore, took the road you have seen, and in consequence you'll condescend to <hi>be</hi> happy, and <hi>make</hi> happy, a year or two sooner than your coquetry would have allow'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>To be happy, and make happy!</p>
<stage>[Smiling and tossing her head.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and that in spite of all those pretty affected airs—they are <hi>but</hi> affected, charmer, you know,
<pb n="90" facs="96"/>
for, at this moment, you feel that I have a kind of resistless impudence about me, which you love for its novelty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>If I thought it possible, Sir—The wretch reads my very heart.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nothing but a wish to <hi>convince</hi> me of it, could bring you to my lodgings; you see the effects of carrying airs too far. You used me in the morning with such barbarity, that your heart, hard as it is, was smote with the reflection, and then you run after me again to make it up. Oh, you dear commiserating—</p>
<stage>[Attempting to snatch her hand.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>How dare you, Sir, insinuate such horrid things? Run after you!—seek you in your lodgings!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear! how a coquette may carry things!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter hastily Sir</hi> MARVEL, BELLAIR, <hi>and</hi> FEELOVE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, oh, here they are! I am come to claim your promise—you must introduce me to Lady Beauville before to-morrow. Not to be at her route, would be to <hi>be</hi> and <hi>not</hi> to be—as Kemble says. Pray Ma'am have you seen Kemble?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Where, Madam—where is Miss Melville?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Where is my niece?—where is Arabella Melville?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Heyday! What is all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Carlton! how little did I suspect that your lodgings—but there she is!—</p>
<stage><hi>[Darting through the wing, followed by</hi> FEELOVE.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p><hi>Are</hi> these Mr. Carlton's lodgings, then? 'Tis well his boldness has such an excuse.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="91" facs="97"/>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible that you did not know it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Know it! Heaven and earth! how can you dare think that I did? I came to visit Miss Melville, whom I attended here this morning, without the most distant idea, that—Bless me! what an imputation has the interest I took in her welfare, subjected me to? I shall never cease to regret the occasion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Nor I to bless it. How many tedious long months of hopes and fears, caprices and coquetry, have I been saved by it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, oh, you are agreed! see the effect of a few good stanzas—'twas my poetry, Madam, not his, upon my honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>What poetry?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Why, that little jeu d' esprit, you know, which was publish'd yesterday, about you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>What! was not <hi>that</hi> Mr. Carlton's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>No; he beg'd to pass for the author, but it was my own composition entirely; without the assistance of any mortal man, whatever—deny it, Mr. Carlton, if you can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>So those wretched lines were yours? It was you who chose to represent me to the public in so odious and hateful a light!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>You had better have been quiet, Sir Marvel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Why, this is dev'lish odd! when they passed for yours, she never said one word against them; and now they are mine, they are wretched, and odious, and hateful!</p>
<stage><hi>Enter Miss</hi> JUVENILE.</stage>
<p>Heyday! Miss Archer in Mr. Carlton's lodgings!
<pb n="92" facs="98"/>
what, my dear creature, you are afraid of another fatire, and so are come to deprecate his wrath?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>No, indeed, my dear creature,—but pray what brought you to Mr. Carlton's lodgings?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Business, Ma'am, I assure you. Pray, Sir, step this way, <stage><hi>[to</hi> CARLTON.]</stage> Here are the verses which you promis'd to get into the news-paper for me.—I have spent this whole day in polishing them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>My dear Madam, Sir Marvel has much more interest that way than I have.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I'll get 'em in—I'll get 'em in, never fear. Let me see. <stage>[She endeavours to snatch them.]</stage> "Description of Sir Marvel Mushroom, or the Cripplegate Knight." What, Madam, me!—me!—am I a subject for a news-paper?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>Yes;—or for a comedy, if I could write one. You are rich in folly, Sir Marvel, and would be a treasure to the public.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Why, Madam, you will not dare—you will not dare. Oh, the license given to these d—d newspapers! I'll get a seat in parliament, in order to vote against the freedom of the press.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>So would all those wretches feel, who tear the minds of the inoffensive or the worthy—were <hi>they</hi> to be stretched on the rack, to which they so unfeelingly devote others.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>My charming creature, you must forgive Sir Marvel—I promised him that you should.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER</speaker>
<p><stage>[smiling]</stage>. Secure first your own forgiveness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>That sweet smile secures it to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>No; you must earn it by long and
<pb n="93" facs="99"/>
faithful services. I will be a tyrant for two whole years, and you shall be the most humble and devoted of my slaves:—My caprice you shall allow to be reason, and my whims shall be your law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<stage>[kissing her hand]</stage>
<p>For two months agreed! but not one hour longer. <stage><hi>[Enter</hi> BELLAIR <hi>and</hi> ARABELLA.]</stage>—My dear Bellair, is this angel yours?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Mine; and by a whimsical concurrence concealed in your lodgings. How much, Miss Archer, am I indebted to you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Indebted to her! No, 'tis to me. <hi>I</hi> wore the cloak, and <hi>I</hi> was pinch'd and pull'd whilst she escaped. One can neither have credit from one's verses or one's good nature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>So you really have forgiven him—Did I not foretell?</p>
<stage>[Archly.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARAB.</speaker>
<p>Oh, goodness! there was nothing to forgive—You can't think how innocent he is.</p>

<p>The devil! What, Bellair found her first! Come, Sir, give up my Bell!</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> FEELOVE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Your Bell! No, no, you must go for <hi>your</hi> bell to another steeple, my old friend—This little silver-toned thing would never be heard on the Welch mountains; and so I have given it to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>To <hi>him!</hi> You must joke, Doctor. You cannot mean to bestow your niece on a poor wretch, the victim, as you have often called him, of atrophy and disease.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="94" facs="100"/>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>There, d'ye see!—again!—again! Sir, you libel me, <hi>and,</hi> Sir—</p>
<stage>[Strutting up to him.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>Libel ye! Why you libel yourself.—That's your poor invalid—the <hi>dying man.</hi> You'll never be able to stand the laugh, if you give your niece to him. Come, come, Doctor, give <hi>me</hi> the—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Sir <hi>I</hi> have received Miss Melville from this gentleman, who will be so generous as to pardon the innocent stratagems of love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Stratagems! What then—what then, are you the—the—</p>
<stage>[trembling.]</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>You know I told you, Doctor, that I had an irresistable fancy, that I should live and become a stout, hale young fellow. I determined not to oppose <hi>my</hi> odd fancy, as the old lady did her's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE</speaker>
<stage>[in extreme anger].</stage>
<p>Ho—h! So, Sir, you had the—the impudence—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, I had the impudence to live—But pray pardon it! I will do any thing but die—I'll swallow all the gums, woods, herbs, and funguses, in your medicopeia, to make it up.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>You had better, Sir—I say, you had better—Oh!</p>
<stage>[Going hastily off.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Stay, good Sir! you must be reconciled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<p>Dear Doctor, be but reconciled, I'll advertise my death, change my name, and fight every man who dares tell me I am alive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>He must <hi>not</hi> be reconciled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>He can't resist us.—I'll make love to him. Dear Doctor!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>And I'll let him prescribe for me—Dear Doctor!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="95" facs="101"/>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> JUV.</speaker>
<p>And I'll write the epithalamium—Dear Doctor!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>He <hi>shall</hi> resist you—He shall <hi>not</hi> be reconciled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Say you so? Here, Mr. Bellair <stage>[giving his hand]</stage> I will be reconciled, though—excuse me!—I should rather you were dead.—However, I will be reconciled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVEGR.</speaker>
<p>Oh, oh, you will, will ye? You shall repent it. Bellair, though I shall never speak to you more, I'll tell you at parting that her fortune is thirty thousand pounds—Remember, <hi>thirty.</hi> There, Doctor, that has cut you short of ten or fifteen thousand, I know; so <hi>your</hi> joke has cost as much as <hi>mine.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>Sir, you are—Sir, my resentment for this usage—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CARL.</speaker>
<p>Oh, gentlemen, you must not—you must not quarrel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARV.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, let 'em quarrel, pray, if they have a fancy for it. Doctor, I'll carry your challenge—What are your weapons?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EVERG.</speaker>
<p>His prescriptions—He can kill with nothing else; he's harmless in all other respects.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FEELOVE.</speaker>
<p>And you are harmless in <hi>nothing</hi> but your wit;—the point of that is never felt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Miss</hi> ARCHER.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, since your anger expends itself in words, there are hopes of its subsiding; and that the happiness we are preparing to enjoy, will neither be clouded by your displeasure; nor by that of our best friends.</p>
<l>To them we bend, submissive to their laws,</l>
<l>Yield, if 'tis censure—blest, if 'tis applause!</l>

<l>I SPEAK the Epilogue! Lud, how they teaze one!</l>
<l>They write so dull—so—seldom they can please one:</l>

<l>And now before 'em, frighten'd, I'll advance.</l>

<l>Ladies and Gents—behold—that is—our play</l>
<l>We hope will—Lud, I don't know what to say!</l>
<l>To entertain the cit, the belle, the beau,</l>
<l>With India—Stamps—or, Race at Fontainbleau.</l>
<l>In days of yore—bright days, with conquest crown'd!</l>
<l>The French we beat, and beat on their own ground;</l>
<l>We conquer still by valour or by cunning,</l>
<l>On their own ground we beat'em now—in running.</l>
<l>I'll try, as Mercury did, a small deception,</l>
<l>It may secure, at least, a good reception.—</l>

<l>Yon low'ring brow says, No—Well!—if you doubt me,</l>
<l>I'll drop the Goddess,—here's enough without me:</l>
<l>Each scarlet Mars above, though e'er so dainty,</l>
<l>May leer around—there's Venus's in plenty;</l>
<l>Or aim his glass beneath, upon the pit,</l>

<l>I speak to you, ye roaring Gods above;—</l>
<l>Momus is surely there, from all this racket,</l>
<l>Yonder he sits—he's in a sailor's jacket;</l>
<l>Thrice happy God, who lives but in a joke!</l>
<l>His Venus laughs, too—in her hat and cloak.</l>
<l>Where have I got to?—Lud, how glib my tongue!</l>
<l>Am I Miss Archer, Venus, or Miss Younge?</l>
<l>Be what I will, among my friends I rank ye,</l>
