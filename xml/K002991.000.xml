<p><hi>King</hi> HENRY <hi>the</hi> VII. OR <hi>The</hi> POPISH IMPOSTOR.</p>

<head>PREFACE</head>
<p>THE following Piece was design'd as a Kind of Mirror to the present Rebellion; and the imagined: Advantage of having it acted before that unnatural Flame could be extinguish'd, was the Reason why it was so hurry'd in the writing; being begun and finish'd in less Time than is necessary tor the forming the Fable only of a correct Play. It was the six Weeks Labour of an Actor, who, even in that short Space, was often call'd from it by his Profession. The Players, for the Sake of Dispatch, had it to study, Act by Act, just as it was blotted; and the only Revisals it received, from the <hi>Brouillon</hi> to the <hi>Press,</hi> were at the Rehearsals of it. So that we must bespeak the Reader's Indulgence for numberless Incorrections thro' the Whole; but more particularly for the Measure and Diction; the Author having neglected them so much, that he cannot call the Manner, in which it is written, either Prose or Verse, but accidentally both. It is certain, Apologies for bad writing seldom procure Remission from the Rigid; yet the most flagrant Crimes when ingenuously confess'd, and follow'd by Repentance, admit of Extenuation from the Benevolent.</p>
<p><hi>N. B.</hi> The Lines mark'd with Commas were omitted after the first Night's acting, the Play being too long in the Performance.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE,</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. <hi>MACKLIN.</hi></byline>
<sp>
<l>BReathes there a <hi>Briton</hi> longs for Popish Chains,</l>
<l>While <hi>Smithfield</hi> Fire our <hi>English</hi> Annals Stains;</l>
<l>When <hi>Popish</hi> Rage and Persecution blaz'd</l>
<l>With <hi>British</hi> Blood on Altars <hi>Rome</hi> had raised;</l>
<l>When Matrons saw their Sons in Flames expire,</l>
<l>Their Husbands crackling in religious Fire.</l>
<l>Then <hi>Rome</hi> gave Laws, our Kings and Council sway'd,</l>
<l>While <hi>Albion</hi> mourn'd her Liberties betray'd.</l>
<l>But now she smiles; our Laws are all our own,</l>
<l>Which rule alike the Cottage and the Throne.</l>
<l>No Tools of Power our Properties invade,</l>
<l>No Heads are chopt for Plots the Court hath made.</l>
<l>By such base Arts her Empire <hi>Rome</hi> maintains,</l>
<l>Axes her Arguments, her Logic Chains;</l>
<l>To these a Martyr gallant <hi>Russel</hi> fell,</l>
<l>And <hi>Sidney</hi> bled, whose Crime was writing well.</l>
<l>But under <hi>George</hi> such Practice is unknown,</l>
<l>For free-born Subjects guard and grace his Throne.</l>
<l>A Prince like him our Author shews to Night,</l>
<l>Who fought for Freedom and his regal Right.</l>
<l>The temporary Piece in Haste was writ,</l>
<l>The six Weeks Labour of a puny Wit;</l>
<l>With melting Measure, Critic Rules unfraught,</l>
<l>Artless he writes,—just as rude Nature taught:</l>
<l>No golden Lines, no polish'd Verse hath he,</l>
<l>But all like <hi>British</hi> Courage, rough and free.</l>
<l>For once then—</l>
<l>Judge not by Critic, but by patriot Laws;</l>
<l>Where Genius fails, support your fav'rite Cause.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE,</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>WOFFINGTON.</hi></byline>
<sp>
<l>BY <hi>Hal</hi> deliver'd from my marriage Vows,</l>
<l><hi>Catherine</hi> again is free to chuse a Spouse.</l>
<l>The Man, who offers fairest, shall succeed,</l>
<l>If <hi>British</hi> born, or of old <hi>Huntley's</hi> Breed.</l>
<l>Of <hi>Rome</hi>-nursed Husbands I have had enough,</l>
<l>O Ladies, they are all such dastard Stuff,</l>
<l>That I my self, equip'd in Cap and Jerkin,</l>
<l>Am every whit as good a Prince as <hi>Perkin.</hi></l>
<l>'Tis true the Boy was loving, soft and tender,</l>
<l>But in the Main an arrant poor Pretender.</l>
<l>Jesting a-part,—now Ladies, what do you say?</l>
<l>What is your Judgment of this hasty Play?</l>
<l>For your Decision here the Author stands;</l>
<l>Let the poor Rogue have Mercy at your Hands.</l>
<l>In sooth we're much beholden to his Art;</l>
<l>For in a female Form he hath placed a manly Heart;</l>
<l>And if in her bright Character you find</l>
<l>Superior Spirit and a <hi>Roman</hi> Mind,</l>
<l>Know, from the Life her Principles he drew,</l>
<l>And hopes the Piece shall live which copies you.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l><hi>FRION,</hi> we all were on the Brink of Fate;</l>
<l>A Nobleman who knew him, when a Child,</l>
<l>Avow'd him an Impostor, born at <hi>Tournay</hi>;</l>
<l>The Son of one <hi>John Osbec</hi>;—not the Heir</l>
<l>Of <hi>England's</hi> King—audaciously assumed.</l>
<l>This stagger'd many of the Court, who warmly</l>
<l>Opposed his Audience; I at length stood up,</l>
<l>And in full Council strait produced our Letters</l>
<l>From <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his Holiness the Pope,</l>
<l>And <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Bohemia</hi>;</l>
<l>And as they all recognize his royal Birth,</l>
<l>The Objection vanish'd; and the King resolved,</l>
<l>To give him instant Audience and support,</l>
<l>Befitting regal State, oppress'd and wrong'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>Most reverend Sir, your Industry and Zeal,</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="7"/>So warmly active in this pious Cause,</l>
<l>Will ever make you dear to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l><hi>Frion,</hi> with religious Joy we will revenge</l>
<l>The irreverent Contempts, lately offer'd</l>
<l>To our holy Church, by unholy <hi>England,</hi></l>
<l>My Functions, secular and religious,</l>
<l>Shall to their utmost, stretch, to fix this <hi>Perkin</hi></l>
<l>On <hi>England's</hi> Throne. <hi>Henry</hi> hath refused</l>
<l>Our King, by my Contrivance, his Daughter</l>
<l><hi>Margaret</hi>; which affront hath sown the Seeds</l>
<l>Of Hate too deep within his youthful Mind</l>
<l>Ever to be weeded out. His Soul's on fire,</l>
<l>And burns with Eagerness to pour Invasion</l>
<l>Into their haughty Land; to loose at once</l>
<l>His unremitting Grudge, on a proud Neighbour,</l>
<l>And a dreaded Rival. But, <hi>Frion,</hi> tho' we</l>
<l>Abound in <hi>Scottish</hi> Blood, ready to be drain'd</l>
<l>Against <hi>England's</hi> Peace, yet Treasure is War's</l>
<l>Strongest Sinew; and without that quick'ning Aid,</l>
<l>The devouring Body wastes to needy Peace.</l>
<l>That must be had.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>Holy, Sir, 'tis ready.</l>
<l>For Years large Collections have been making</l>
<l>In <hi>England, Spain,</hi> and ever-helping <hi>France</hi>;</l>
<l>These Sums for the present are lodged with me;</l>
<l>But now a special Order from his Holiness</l>
<l>Divests me of the Charge, and to your Care</l>
<l>Commits the Trust.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l>Our unerring Father's Confidence</l>
<l>Does Honour to my Zeal; I will bestow</l>
<l>The Treasure as his Holiness directs</l>
<l>And the religious Cause demands. But how</l>
<l>Stands <hi>Ireland?</hi> What Hopes from thence?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trion.</speaker>
<l>None.</l>
<pb n="3" facs="8"/><l>Th' Apostate Slaves are fallen off from <hi>Rome,</hi></l>
<l>And firmly fixt in the Usurper's Cause;</l>
<l><hi>Kildare, Clanrikard,</hi> with many others</l>
<l>On whom we built absolute Assurance,</l>
<l>Have, at their own Charge, arm'd their Friends 'and Followers,</l>
<l>And join'd the <hi>English</hi> General, <hi>Poinings</hi>;</l>
<l>For which may divine Vengeance taint their Air,</l>
<l>And visit them to late Posterity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l>How are the <hi>English</hi> affected towards us?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>As our Hearts could wish;</l>
<l>Sir <hi>Robert Clifford,</hi> and many others,</l>
<l>All of high Rank, and eminent Esteem,</l>
<l>In Discontent, at present, with their King,</l>
<l>By Gold and Promises have I firmly fixt.</l>
<l>Yet more, the Usurper's Bosom-Friend, the Man</l>
<l>Nearest his Heart, cross'd in ambitious Views,</l>
<l>Has secretly vow'd Revenge, and is ours</l>
<l>By Oath and Heart; so that <hi>England's</hi> Measures</l>
<l>Are betray'd as soon as form'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l>So far then Probability attends us,</l>
<l>And gives almost Assurance of Success.</l>
<l>But one Thing more.—Is <hi>Perkin</hi> well prepar'd?</l>
<l>Can he affect the Blush of Innocence?</l>
<l>Hath he the steadfast Eye that looks against</l>
<l>Enquiry? Can he stand the Shock of gazing</l>
<l>Numbers? And tell his Tale without Confusion?</l>
<l>Is he Master of the false Tear and feigned Sigh?</l>
<l>For to a crowded Presence he must speak.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>He is not to be taught his Lesson now:</l>
<l>The blended Care of Nature and of Art</l>
<l>Have stamp'd him perfect; a majestic Mein,</l>
<l>A Countenance, where Sweetness and Command</l>
<l>Smile awfully together; a Deportment,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="9"/>Courtly, but not effeminate; a Skill,</l>
<l>That calls him Master of most Languages;</l>
<l>But chiefly <hi>English</hi>; with a soothing Carriage</l>
<l>Which beggars the Persuasion of his Tongue.</l>
<l>His suppos'd Aunt, <hi>Margaret of Burgundy,</hi></l>
<l>Has form'd his Education; she has made him</l>
<l>A living History of <hi>England's</hi> Factions;</l>
<l>The various Interests, Battles, Revolutions,</l>
<l>The Friends, the Enemies of either House,</l>
<l>This of <hi>Plantagenet,</hi> or that of <hi>Lancaster.</hi></l>
<l>He is Master of many Languages;</l>
<l>But chiefly <hi>English</hi>; to ingratiate him</l>
<l>With the People, and stamp him native.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l>The King is soft and warm, susceptible of Pity,</l>
<l>Prompt to receive th' Impression of Humanity;</l>
<l>If <hi>Perkin</hi> do but tell his Tale with Skill,</l>
<l>Th' unwary Youth will sympathize in Sorrow</l>
<l>And take and keep what Form his Art bestows.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>Doubt not his Art, my Lord, he is compleat;</l>
<l>And often has rehears'd his kingly Part</l>
<l>In <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and in <hi>Italy</hi>;</l>
<l>Where admiring Crowds have wonder'd forth his Praise.</l>
<l>And given natural Marks of Majesty;</l>
<l>In Look, Tone, Gesture, Gate, and Voice:</l>
<l>And credulous tale-believing Women,</l>
<l>To whom Appearances are sacred Truths,</l>
<l>Have, at his well-told Tale dissolved in Tears.</l>
<l>Thus, my Lord, like a graceful, well-skill'd Actor,</l>
<l>He steals, where e'er he plays his princely Part,</l>
<l>Or popular Applause, or melting Pity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l><hi>Frion,</hi> some subtle Means must be contriv'd</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="10"/>To fling Division's Fire-brands 'mongst the <hi>English,</hi></l>
<l>For should they join their Hearts and Resolutions,</l>
<l>The united Pow'r of <hi>Europe,</hi> nay, the World</l>
<l>Could not prevail against them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>Care is taken.</l>
<l>On every Side, our Emissaries ply,</l>
<l>And blacken the Usurper; Gold and Prayer</l>
<l>Alternately are us'd, and with Success,</l>
<l>To bribe his Council and to win his Subjects.</l>
<l><hi>Richard</hi>'s divine, hereditary Right,</l>
<l>A Right Infallibility confirms,</l>
<l>And which that Power makes indefeasible,</l>
<l>Is preach'd amongst them; strengthen'd by the 'Terror</l>
<l>Of Bulls, Anathemas, and Hell eternal</l>
<l>To those who disbelieve, or disobey.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l>'Tis well. But we must haste; the King expects us.</l>
<l>I'll conduct the Youth. Is he ready?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>He is, my Lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l><hi>Frion,</hi> in your publick Manifestos</l>
<l>Be sure you promise free Power of Worship,</l>
<l>To the <hi>Lollards,</hi> and all Separatists.</l>
<l>Men fight by Halves, with a kind of bastard</l>
<l>Courage on Rebellion's Side, without Religion.</l>
<l>But when that's hook'd in, why then, Biggotry,</l>
<l>Flaming Biggotry, tunes Rebellion's Discord</l>
<l>Into pious Loyalty; and makes Men fight</l>
<l>With hot, enthusiastic Vigour,</l>
<l>And forget the Name of Rebel. For then</l>
<l>The Cause and Quarrel are no longer earthly</l>
<l>But derived of Heaven!

<l>Thus far the Gale blows right, and all goes well,—</l>
<l>But, <hi>Frion,</hi> we must leap another Bound;</l>
<l>Another Danger still must be encounter'd;</l>
<l>I must apprize thee that our <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobility,</l>
<l>Proud, and tenacious of their antient Rights,</l>
<l>Vent daily murmurs and form close Cabals;</l>
<l>Forsake the Court, and bitterly inveigh</l>
<l>Against the Church; as having usurp'd of late</l>
<l>Too much Authority in temporal Sway.</l>
<l>Loud are their Complaints that by Priests and <hi>Frenchmen</hi></l>
<l>They are precluded from the Royal Ear.</l>
<l>Some of these factious Spirits have been quell'd,</l>
<l>Some of them banish'd, and their Lands confiscate;</l>
<l>Others imprison'd, nay and some cut off:</l>
<l>Yet still their dreaded Leaders do remain;</l>
<l><hi>Alexander Gordon,</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi></l>
<l>The young Lord <hi>Daliel,</hi></l>
<l>And <hi>Archibald Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus.</hi></l>
<l>Still they erect their Crests, and with Impunity,</l>
<l>Vent their black Malice 'gainst the Church and us.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>How have they scap'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l>Thro' Fear, not Lenity.</l>
<l>Their Friends are numerous, their Possessions large;</l>
<l>Their Deaths wou'd be Forerunners of our Ruin.</l>
<l>Else, let me speak it like a true <hi>Romish</hi> Church-Man,</l>
<l>Their irksome Beings had not now perplex'd us.</l>
<l>They have absented long from Court and Council;</l>
<l>But late a special Summons from the King</l>

<l>But, holy Sir, I doubt these headstrong Lords</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l>No Matter, <hi>Frion,</hi> we can do without them;</l>
<l>For me, I'm determin'd; and for the King,</l>
<l>He acts by my controuling Will, not his own.</l>
<l>It is not prudent that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi></l>
<l>Should e're let Kings or Rulers think for themselves;</l>
<l>Th' unerring See should ever be their Guide.</l>
<l>As to those heretic Lords, their Assent</l>
<l>For <hi>Perkin</hi> is our least Concern. We have</l>
<l>More important Views upon them.—Death, Death.</l>
<l><hi>Frion, Huntley</hi> must not live, he stalks and roars</l>
<l>But one Day more in Freedom's spacious Forest.</l>
<l>The Toil is set for th' unwily Lion;</l>
<l>And his own boundless Spirit drives him in.</l>
<l>He thinks the King mislead, and will bellow</l>
<l>Without Guile or Guard; for the Fool is brave,</l>
<l>Ev'n to romantick Madness. '<hi>Scotland</hi>'s Good</l>
<l>'So strongly burns within him, it appears</l>
<l>'His only Passion. Freedom is his God;</l>
<l>Which he so idolizes, he would make</l>
<l>The World his Proselytes, did they but hear him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>Lord <hi>Sevez,</hi> 'tis not fit such Men exist.</l>

<l>Free speaking, or his Head answer th' Default.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>Omniscient Wisdom still directs your Mind</l>
<l>And points your Purpose to some holy End.</l>
<l>But, my right reverend Sir, one thing remains</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="16"/>Unsettled yet, which only you can finish:—</l>
<l>You know this <hi>Perkin</hi> burns for <hi>Huntley</hi>'s Daughter,</l>
<l><hi>Scotland</hi>'s gay Ornament, and Nature's Pride;</l>
<l>This Angel-looking Maid, this <hi>Katherine Gordon,</hi></l>
<l>To young Lord <hi>Daliel</hi> has been late betroth'd,</l>
<l>The Follower and fervent Friend of <hi>Huntley</hi>;</l>
<l>Your Wonder-working Wisdom now must break</l>
<l>This fatal Knot, or <hi>England</hi>'s blazing Crown</l>
<l>Will sit like Death upon his princely Head.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l>This Business in the Council has been weigh'd;</l>
<l>The King resolves to gratify his Wish,</l>
<l>And give the lovely <hi>Katherine</hi> to young <hi>Perkin.</hi></l>
<l>Which Match will either fix this dangerous</l>
<l><hi>Huntley</hi> in our Cause, or with enraged Madness</l>
<l>Break his proud stubborn Heart: For his Daughter</l>
<l>Next to Liberty is his earthly Idol.</l>
<l>But I must leave you;—for the Council sits</l>
<l>To found those factious Lords.—I must attend.
<stage>Exit.</stage></l>

<l>My Brother Priest is zealous in our Cause;</l>
<l>His Pride and Avarice must be the Tools,</l>
<l>With which we work.—They are sharp and handy</l>
<l>And in a Priest, who sways the royal Mind,</l>
<l>Will rid much Business: <hi>Gordon</hi>'s lovely Daughter,</l>
<l>(Who is of royal Blood) to <hi>Perkin</hi> join'd,</l>
<l>Will knit the Scots to us, indissolubly.</l>
<l>For after Marriage, should they find the Cheat,</l>
<l>'Twill then become their Interest to conceal it;</l>
<l>Nay to espouse it too.—Which if they do refuse,</l>
<l>The Magazines of <hi>Rome</hi>'s affrighting Vengeance,</l>

<l>My Speech, like my Manners, are plain and uncourtly.</l>
<l>I have been bred a Soldier, a <hi>Scotch</hi> Soldier,</l>
<l>Not an <hi>Italian</hi> Flatterer. My old Body</l>
<l>Is dry'd and chill'd with toilsome Marches, thro'</l>

<l>My Country's Foe.</l>
<l>I have not been used to silken Coverli Is,</l>
<l>And <hi>Solon</hi> Beds,—but to the friendly Plaid,</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="18"/>And swampy Earth; and my best Lodging oft</l>
<l>Hath been the dryest Turf, the blooming Hether,</l>
<l>The wholesome Fern. Our unletter'd Bards then</l>
<l>Flatter'd not the Living but prais'd the Dead.</l>
<l>Their Songs were not who steep'd deepest in <hi>Italian</hi></l>
<l>Luxury, or deck'd gayest in foreign Frippery,</l>
<l>But who had most Wounds in Battle, or fought</l>
<l>Hardiest in their Country's Cause. This Court</l>
<l>Was not then the Rendezvous of <hi>Italian</hi> Minstrels,</l>
<l>Priests and Legates,—but the hospitable Home</l>
<l>Of <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobility, whose Ancestors</l>
<l>This Realm coeval'd; and when grown strengthless</l>
<l>By fighting <hi>Scotland's</hi> Battles, grew venerably grey</l>
<l>In her faithful Councils.—Where are they now?</l>
<l>Here are none such. Your Nobles are Strangers</l>

<sp>

<l>Sir, Counsel, void of Freedom,</l>
<l>May flatter and mislead, but never can assist.</l>
<l>Freedom is the Guide, the unerring Guide</l>
<l>To sacred Truth, in a Nation's Council.</l>
<l>The <hi>free-born</hi> Subject's indisputable Right;</l>
<l>And never suffer'd Prohibition yet,</l>

<l>My Liege, I have fought my Country's Battles</l>

<l>Into the Mind; the whole a moving Scene</l>
<l>Of busy Fate. And after Battle, I have</l>
<l>Seen the hard-fought, conquer'd Field, strew'd with Death</l>
<l>And Slaughter. There I've beheld our gallant,</l>
<l>Helpless Nobles, breathing out final Groans;</l>
<l>Their active Blood baked and clotted</l>
<l>By scorching Heat, or swallow'd by the greedy</l>
<l>Sun-crack'd Earth. There I beheld Brothers and</l>
<l>Kinsmen stript, and piled on mangled Heaps</l>
<l>Of Slaughter;—<hi>Kerns</hi> and <hi>Thanes</hi> promiscuous.</l>
<l>There searching for my dear, my darling, only Son,</l>
<l>I found his well-known, headless Trunk, all gash'd</l>
<l>And mangled,—with his Brains dash'd and scatter'd</l>
<l>'Gainst a blood-stain'd Oak.—Yet these were Sights of Joy</l>
<l>To what I now behold.</l>
<l><pb n="15" facs="20"/>I see my Country bleeding in her vital Vein;</l>
<l>I see her Nobles banish'd, imprison'd, and assassin'd;</l>
<l>I see <hi>Scotland's</hi> Dregs compose her Councils;</l>
<l>All Concerns, sacred, civil, and military,</l>
<l>Sold and huckster'd as in a publick Mart.</l>
<l>I see Majesty—deluded Majesty,</l>

<l>Seditious Jealousie of his best Subjects.</l>
<l>O awake, awake, anointed Sir, and</l>

<l>MY Lords, no longer let us doubt the Truth.</l>

<l>Conceal'd and cherish'd by those needy Kerns;</l>
<l>While envious <hi>France</hi> prepares her Armaments</l>
<l>T' invade our Land, and aid the Vagrant's Claim.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stan.</speaker>
<l>I trust, great Sir, that th' Alarm is false;</l>
<l>I cannot think that <hi>Scotland's</hi> King would e'er abet</l>
<l>An Impostor's Claim against your native Right;</l>
<l>Back'd and supported by your Subjects Voice,</l>
<l>Their Hands and Hearts; the best, the surest, Right</l>
<l>To <hi>England's</hi> Crown.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>That Right be ever mine.</l>
<l>My firmest Bulwark, against foreign Threats,</l>
<l>Shall ever be my Subjects Love; secure</l>
<l>In that, <hi>England's</hi> King, and this Sea-girt Isle,</l>
<l>May defy the warring World. But, <hi>Stanley,</hi></l>
<l>Are our Fleets in Readiness to scower</l>
<l>The dastard <hi>French?</hi> to sink and burn their hostile</l>

</sp>

<speaker>Stan.</speaker>
<l>They are, my Leige.</l>
<l>Proudly they ride, and plow the angry Main,</l>

<l>Well, Lords, what says our apostate Minion;</l>
<l>Have you condemn'd him?</l>

<l>His Treasons have, Sir;</l>
<l>Which were as manifest, as foul and dangerous.</l>
<l><pb n="38" facs="43"/>The conscious Guilt of his Conspiracy</l>

<l>Unimportun'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<l>O Lord Bishop, that argued Shame and Sorrow</l>
<l>For his Folly; and tho' in letter'd Law</l>
<l>It stands against him, yet in our Mercy,</l>
<l>And the Softness of our friendly Nature,</l>
<l>It pleads strongly for him.</l>
<l>Extremity of Law is sometimes too sharp</l>
<l>Even for our traiterous Subjects; on whom,</l>
<l>Especially when penitent, Chastisement</l>
<l>Shou'd fall not with a rigorous Cruelty,</l>
<l>But paternal Sorrow; as the fond Father</l>
<l>Corrects his truant Child. Let me then, Lords,</l>
<l>For this unhappy Man, I once call'd Friend,</l>
<l>Wear a grateful Pity in my Breast.</l>
<l>He gave me Life and Crown in <hi>Bosworth</hi> Field;</l>
<l>Let me repay the Debt, and give him Life,</l>
<l>Too justly forfeited by foul Rebellion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ox.</speaker>
<l>My Lord, from my Heart I wish the Treason</l>
<l>Cou'd be punish'd, and th' unhappy Traitor</l>
<l>Spar'd. But I believe your Subjects, at this Juncture,</l>
<l>Expect Examples of publick Justice.</l>
<l>It gives me Grief to say it, but Clamour</l>
<l>Is so violent against him, 'mongst all</l>
<l>Degrees of People, that I fear Mercy,</l>
<l>At this Time, wou'd be an Act dangerous</l>
<l>To yourself and State.</l>
</sp>

<l><pb n="47" facs="52"/>The House of <hi>Gordon</hi> we have ever deem'd</l>

<l>Sir, a King's Word is of religious Nature;</l>

<l>None but our Mother, the holy, holy</l>
<l>Infallible Church,—Heaven's Vice-gerent!</l>
<l>Before her, indeed, Laws, Oaths, Obligations,</l>
<l>Of what Kind soever, lose their Being.</l>
<l>You, Sir, in Council</l>
<l><pb n="57" facs="62"/>Gave religious Word, Lord <hi>Huntley</hi> should die.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Scot.</speaker>
<l>'Twas by your Influence I revok'd my Word.</l>
<l>You urged 'twou'd be gracious in die Eye of <hi>Rome</hi></l>
<l>To ally Duke <hi>Richard</hi> to our Blood,</l>
<l>By Marriage with <hi>Gordon</hi>'s lovely Daughter.</l>
<l>All Means of Success were barr'd, except</l>
<l>My Promise of her Father's Life; which she,</l>
<l>Cover'd with Rage and Sorrow, from Love and</l>
<l>Nature's extream Reluctance, at last accepted.</l>
<l>Then how, my <hi>Sevez,</hi> how can I answer</l>
<l>My Breach of Word to her, or to myself?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sevez.</speaker>
<l>Sacred Sir, your religious Scruple gives me Joy.</l>

<l>He is grown too popular for kingly Power</l>
<l>To cope with. The factious Lords, his Friends,—</l>
<l>And the distemper'd Rabble are at his Beck.</l>

<l>Yet our holy Church wou'd have insisted</l>
<l>On their Deaths; or on your Head have denounc'd</l>
<l><pb n="58" facs="63"/>Her hottest Vengeance. For they're Hereticks</l>
<l>Of the new-sprung Sect; call'd in <hi>England Lollards</hi>;</l>

<l>The Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> which nothing but their Blood</l>
<l>Can expiate. 'Your Allies of <hi>France</hi> too</l>
<l>'Wou'd have stopt their Aid and Loans, and have 'left you</l>

I Have broke the Bond of Duty with the best of Fathers, of Honour and Affection with the most deserving of Lovers. This I have done to give you and your noble Friends Life and Liberty,
<pb n="62" facs="67"/>
in Hopes you will rescue your King and Country from those who have advised your Deaths, my Marriage, and the innumerable Woes <hi>Scotland</hi> groans under.</p>
<p>Consider, Sir, my Crime is the Effect of your Precepts; which always taught me to prefer my Country's Weal to Life, Fame or Family. I will not sue for Pardon, but Pity, tho' you condemn me, I know your tender Nature will grant to your once loved—now broken-hearted,<lb/>

<speaker>Hunt.</speaker>
<l>Nobles, Freemen, and <hi>Scots</hi>; I've transgress'd the Laws</l>
<l>Of our King and Council, and 'gainst their Sentence,</l>
<l>From Death, have borrow'd a few Hours to live</l>
<l>Amongst you. Then as my Time is short,</l>
<l>I cannot waste it in golden Speech or</l>
<l>Rounded Phrase; for if my Subject will not</l>
<l>Move you, my Eloquence cannot. Then to th' Purpose.</l>
<l>Many I see here whose Sires, and Grandsires,</l>
<l>Have fought with me for Liberty, in the</l>
<l>Very Field where now we stand. You <hi>Matthew Steward,</hi></l>
<l>Earl of <hi>Lenox, Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Forbes,</hi></l>
<l><pb n="70" facs="75"/>And <hi>Duncan Dundass,</hi> Lion King of Arms,</l>
<l>To you I speak particularly—your</l>
<l>Fathers I well remember to've fought with.</l>
<l>And many more no doubt are here, which</l>
<l>My Eye cannot now take in. I have seen</l>
<l>Their free, their willing Swords plow thro' Tyranny,</l>
<l>And their smoaking Blood sluic'd to manure this Field.</l>
<l>From whence reviv'd the sweetest fairest Flower</l>
<l>That e're adorn'd <hi>Scotland</hi>'s Soil.</l>
<l>Liberty, my Friends! Priest-stab'd Liberty!</l>
<l>This Flower,</l>
<l>Countrymen, your Fathers have transmitted</l>
<l>To your Care. Then take Heed on't, preserve it</l>
<l>As you wou'd Existence; set it in the Centre</l>
<l>Of your Hearts; that's it's native Soil, there,</l>
<l>Only there 'twill flourish,—Trust it to <hi>Rome,</hi></l>
<l>Priests, or Priest-rid Monarchs, 'twill surely perish.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Hunt.</speaker>
<l>I've had secret Conference, in <hi>Norham</hi> Castle,</l>
<l>With his Grace of <hi>York</hi>; and have settled such</l>
<l>Terms as will, I hope, restore Peace and Freedom</l>
<l>To our harrass'd Land; and befit the Honour</l>
<l>Of our King to ratify.</l>
<l>O Countrymen, I have not Time nor Memory</l>
<l>To sum up our Evils; they are beyond</l>
<l>Arithmetic's enumerating Power:</l>
<l>'Tis your own feeling that can convey</l>
<l>The Number of your Stings, and your own Deeds</l>
<l>That must redress 'em.</l>
<l>So all those, who are in love</l>

<l>Nature at our Return feels eager sympathizing Joy;</l>
<l>How happens the Reverse in you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Perkin.</speaker>
<l>I own Sadness sits round my Heart,</l>
<l>To think, I must depopulate, and waste</l>
<l>My Native Land; to wade thro' Cruelty,</l>
<l>Blood and Slaughter! to have the Infant slain!</l>
<l>The Aged murder'd! to have Sword, Fire,</l>
<l>And total Devastation overspread the Land,</l>
<l>E're I can purchase my just Inheritance!—</l>
<l>This, in extream Grief, my Soul deplores.</l>
<l>O, Sir, my Heart grieves for my poor People!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Scot.</speaker>
<l>Your People, methinks, deserve your Anger</l>
<l>More than your Sorrow; for not a Man as yet</l>
<l>Hath rais'd Hand or Voice in your Defence.</l>
<l>But, on the contrary, all seem resolute against you,</l>
<l>Why come not Sir <hi>Robert Clifford</hi> and <hi>Stanley,</hi></l>
<l>As they promis'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>Sir, be assur'd they are not inactive.</l>
<l><hi>Clifford,</hi> I know, is true as Heart can wish;</l>
<l><pb n="72" facs="77"/>And for <hi>Stanley,</hi> his Resentment is too deep</l>
<l>Within his Heart ever to be eras'd.</l>
<l>The Clergy, to a Man, are warm and zealous;</l>
<l>And, already, under Pretence of not</l>
<l>Paying a Subsidy, have privately</l>
<l>Stirr'd up twenty thousand hardy Britons</l>
<l>Now in Arms in <hi>Cornwal.</hi>—Many Friends too</l>
<l>Lurk slily in the great Metropolis,</l>
<l>And thro'out the Realm, who artfully joyn</l>
<l>The common Cry against Invasion, <hi>France,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Pretender.—But when Time</l>
<l>Serves, are ready, one and all, to use and</l>
<l>Massacre the Heretics, and all whom</l>
<l>They suspect as Enemies to our Church,</l>
<l>Or young <hi>Plantagenet's</hi> Claim.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Scot.</speaker>
<l>But, <hi>Frion, France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> are tardy;</l>

<l>Into <hi>Ireland?</hi> And the South and West of <hi>England?</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frion.</speaker>
<l>Most royal <hi>James, France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi></l>
<l>Are prompt as Revenge and Hatred can inspire;</l>
<l>But as yet they cannot stir—the <hi>English</hi></l>
<l>With their Fleets will not let them</l>
<l>Look forth; or e're this, Devastation wou'd</l>

<l>Justice dare—gracious Sir, let Reason school</l>
<l>Your youthful distemper'd Heat, and sound Judgment</l>
<l>Soon will follow; with sincere Allegiance</l>
<l>And Affection we're come to close this Breach,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>K. Scot.</speaker>
<l>Well, Sir, let us</l>
<l>See an Instance of your Love and Loyalty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hunt.</speaker>
<l>You shall Sir,—first, you Priest, who Coward like</l>
<l>Puts Majesty in Front when Danger threats,</l>
<l>You, Sir, to your Sphere—the Altar—a Throne</l>
<stage>Pulls him from behind the King, and throws him to the Guard.</stage>
<l>Of Freedom never was design'd for <hi>Rome's</hi> Priests.</l>
<l>Now, Sir,
<stage>[To the King.]</stage></l>
<l>You are, as you shou'd be, King of <hi>Scotland</hi>;</l>
<l>Before, the Pope was.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Scot.</speaker>
<l>Hear me, rash Man—do not presume—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hunt.</speaker>
<l>My Liege,</l>
<l><hi>Rome's</hi> Legates have no Business round our Throne;</l>
<l>The Church is their Capitol,—there let them thunder out</l>
<l>Their Threats, Pennance, Bulls, and Absolutions;</l>
<l>And if they can, why, let 'em save our Souls;—</l>
<l>But for our Property, and our Freedom,</l>
<l><pb n="75" facs="80"/>We can preserve them ourselves without troubling</l>
<l>Their Infallibility.</l>

<speaker>K. Scot</speaker>
<l>Lord <hi>Huntley,</hi></l>
<l>This Insolence is beyond Sufferance.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hunt.</speaker>
<l>Sir, 'tis not Insolence but Loyalty;</l>
<l>Built on Nature's first Law—and the first Compact</l>
<l>That made a King. The People's Interest,</l>
<l>In a free Nation, is blended, and co-equal</l>
<l>With the King's; and he who separates, or</l>
<l>Over-values either, is the Traitor;</l>
<l>Not we, who want to unite and poise them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Scot.</speaker>
<l>Sir, this is a Language, I'm unus'd to.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hunt.</speaker>
<l>I know it is, young King; therefore I speak it.</l>
<l>For when Tyrant Folly surrounds the Throne,</l>
<l>The Truth to our King is the Nation's best</l>
<l>Loyalty. Look into our honest Neighbour's,</l>
<l>The <hi>English</hi> Annals; see their Insolence</l>
<l>In Defence of Liberty encroach'd by</l>
<l><hi>Rome</hi>-directed Kings. See their determin'd</l>
<l>Honest Souls, wading thro' mercenary</l>
<l>Slavish Blood, to shake off <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome's</hi> usurp'd</l>
<l>Authority. See each Man, active as</l>
<l>The first <hi>Brutus,</hi> driving out the <hi>Tarquins</hi></l>
<l>Of their Land—and sacrificing themselves</l>
<l>And Sons to Liberty.—Copy them, them</l>
<l>My Liege—not <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Scot.</speaker>
<l>These Sounds are harsh</l>
<l>They grate and discord in the Ears of Kings.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hunt.</speaker>
<l>Sir, none reverence Majesty more than I.</l>
<l>'Tis the People's sacred Repository</l>
<l>Of Freedom, Justice, Mercy, and all their</l>
<l>Social Happiness; and as such, when pure,</l>
<l><pb n="76" facs="81"/>I kneel, and I adore it—but when defil'd</l>
<l>By Tyranny and Priestcraft, it becomes</l>
<l>A Magazine of Vengeance, and all our</l>
<l>Veneration turns to Contempt and Wrath.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Scot.</speaker>
<l><hi>Huntley,</hi> if you love us cease this Doctrine.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Bows to the King—then turns to the Lords.</stage>

We'll try what Mettle there is in <hi>French</hi>-rais'd Rebels. Side by Side we'll march thro' their disjoynted Ranks, like Death and Time. The Rogues shall sicken at our Sight. Pale Pannic shall catch from Eye to Eye, 'till the trembling Phantom beat at their rebel Hearts Death's last Alarm.</p>

<l>My Liege, by a trusty Spy, just escap'd,</l>
<l>I've learn'd that th' Impostor arriv'd last Night</l>
<l>In the Rebel's Camp; with some straggling <hi>French</hi></l>
<l>And <hi>Highlanders,</hi> a few Priests and <hi>Irish</hi>;</l>
<l>And a Lady, whose Beauty and Sorrow</l>
<l>Fill'd the whole Camp with Pity and Amazement.</l>

<sp>

<l>Ha! it is my Child! my brokenh-earted <hi>Katherine!</hi></l>

<l>Be kept at all our Ports, lest he escape.</l>
<l>And a Reward thro' out our Realm proclaim'd</l>
<l>Of one thousand Marks to him who brings his Head.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dawb.</speaker>
<p>Our Spy brought farther News—he say'd 'twas rumour'd in the Rebels Camp that the Earl of <hi>Devonshire</hi> and his Friends, the Mayor of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and many of the Citizens, were march'd to joyn your Majesty, and that the Rebels had resolv'd to advance and give us Battle e're the Junction cou'd be effected—and by a Gentleman just arriv'd, the Earl is now within an Hour's March.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>The Earl is most valiant, as are all his Friends!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dawb.</speaker>
<p>In their March from <hi>Exeter,</hi> the Villains have been guilty of most unheard of Outrages; as if Waste, Ruin, Havock, and Desolation were their only Purport. At <hi>Perrin,</hi> my Liege, they have committed a savage Cruelty. The Commissioner, for daring to expostulate concerning the Revenue, was cruelly murder'd! while his Wife, and two virgin Daughters, before his dying Eyes, were sacrificed to their brutal Lust!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>K. Hen.</speaker>
<l>Barbarous Villains! Shame to human Kind!</l>
<l>But speedy Vengeance shall o'ertake them.</l>
<l>What may the Number of their savage Force</l>
<l>Amount to?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dawb.</speaker>
<l>Rumour calls 'em thirty Thousand,</l>
<l>But the strictest Intelligence, my Liege,</l>
<l>Cannot muster them to above Five and Twenty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<l>Lord <hi>Oxford,</hi> Security oft hath been</l>
<l>The teeming Mother of blind Destruction.</l>
<l>Let not our Safety then beget our Ruin;</l>
<l>But let us fight with that Caution and Courage,</l>
<l>As if each rude Rebel was a Caesar.</l>
<l>Let our Judgment be cool, our Battle warm,</l>
<l>The Blow will then be sure. Their Numbers are</l>
<l>Formidable, what e'er their Discipline,</l>
<l>Or Courage may be. Then, e'er we charge 'em, Lords,</l>

<p>See, my Liege, where <hi>Scotland</hi>'s Honour comes; feebly he drags the Remains of Life, which wasting War and Time have left him. Yet my Veterian was not unactive to Day; his biting Whinyeard made some of the Rogues skip.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Hunt. Cath. <hi>and Soldier.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Ox.</speaker>
<p>Welcome my Volunteer, how now, what have we here another Pretender!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hunt.</speaker>
<l>Ay, my Lord, a Pretender she is indeed;</l>
<l>But one who ne'er meant ill to <hi>England.</hi></l>
<l>It is my dear <hi>Katherine</hi>; whose Woes outraging</l>
<l>The Cure of Patience, flew to War, and this</l>
<l>Impostor Garment, as to the swiftest</l>
<l>Means of Death. In the Midst of Battle she</l>
<l>Was taken; and now kneels <hi>England's</hi> Pris'ner.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<l>Rise, fair <hi>Katherine</hi>; your Woes we oft have pity'd,</l>
<l>But we hope they now are ended. The Joy</l>
<l>Your Deliverance brings to <hi>Huntley's</hi> Heart,</l>
<l><pb n="95" facs="100"/>We share in; and that Joy shall be your Ransom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hunt.</speaker>
<l>Thanks to your Majesty!—but here is the Man,
<stage>takes the Soldier by the Hand.</stage></l>
<l>Whose Humanity and Courage add Lustre</l>
<l>To the Soldier,—Dignity to human Nature.</l>
<l>This is her Deliverer; fated by</l>
<l>Providence this Day to stand between my Child</l>
<l>And Death.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<l>Or Memory plays me false,</l>
<l>Or thou art the Man, who this Day sav'd me</l>
<l>From the <hi>Highland</hi> Pole-Ax.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sold.</speaker>
<p>So please your Majesty, I did see you sorely smote in the Battle, and down, and bleeding, that I must confess. And had a common Fellow-Soldier been in that Condition, I would have cover'd him from farther Harm if I could. But, when I saw my King in Danger, I would have lost a thousand Lives, but I would have brought him off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<l>Honest Soul—Lord <hi>Oxford,</hi> let this Soldier</l>
<l>Constantly be near our Person. Let him</l>
<l>Command our Body-Guards,—our Battle-Axes,</l>
<l>As Earnest of what we farther intend him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hunt.</speaker>
<p>Thou dear Deliverer of my Child, let me add my Acknowledgment to thy Worth. Receive this Ring, the bright Inheritance which hath descended thro' the House of <hi>Gordon</hi> for many Generations. Wear the precious Pledge, not as a Reward, but a Mark of endless Gratitude, from a tender Father, and a loving Friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<l>Lord <hi>Huntley,</hi> we now will haste towards <hi>Scotland's</hi> Frontiers,</l>
<l>Where we will celebrate the happy Nuptials</l>
<l>Of royal <hi>James,</hi> and our Daughter <hi>Margaret.</hi></l>
<l>Joy shall revel thro' both our Realms, and every</l>
<l><pb n="96" facs="101"/>Subject's Heart shall abound with Happiness.</l>
<l><hi>York, Oxford, Huntley,</hi> and all my Fellow Soldiers,</l>
<l>Shall be crown'd with Wreaths of smiling Victory;</l>
<l>For they have fought this Day, like true <hi>Britons</hi>;</l>
<l>Such as great <hi>Caesar</hi> had to cope withal;</l>
<l>Whose unpolish'd Courage, not all the Art</l>
<l>And tutor'd Discipline of War—like <hi>Rome</hi></l>
<l>Cou'd conquer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ox.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, my Liege, let but the Kings of this little Nook, all act their Parts as you do yours, and I'll engage the People will never fail in theirs; let them but give us our constitutional Freedom, and we in Return will give them our Hearts and Purses; and then my Life for it, they never fail of Victory, let who will attack them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<l>My Lord, your Remark is just; <hi>English</hi> Courage</l>
<l>Must be foster'd with <hi>English</hi> Liberty;</l>
<l>And the King's Power supported by the Peoples Hearts.</l>
<l>United thus, let King and Subject stand,</l>
<l>Shields to each other, Guardians of the Land;</l>
<l>Let Faction cease, Commerce and Freedom smile,</l>
<l>The World can't conquer then, this War-Proof Isle.</l>
