<head>TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FREDERICK, PRINCE of WALES.</head>
<opener><salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>THE Honour YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS has done me in the Protection you was pleased to give to this Tragedy, emboldens me to lay it now at your Feet, and beg your Permission to publish it under your Royal Patronage. The Favouring and Protecting of Letters has been, in all Ages and Countries, one distinguishing Mark of a great Prince; and That with good reason, not only as it shews a Justness of Taste, and Elevation of Mind, but as
<pb n="iv" facs="4"/>
the Influence of such a Protection, by exciting good Writers to labour with more Emulation in the Improvement of their several Talents, not a little contributes to the Embellishment, and Instruction of Society. But of all the different Species of Writing, none has such an Effect upon the Lives and Manners of Men, as the Dramatick; and therefore That of all others most deserves the Attention of Princes, who by a judicious Approbation of such Pieces as tend to promote all Publick and Private Virtue, may more than by any coercive Methods secure the Purity of the Stage, and in consequence thereof greatly advance the Morals and Politeness of their People. How eminently YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS has always extended your Favour and Patronage to every Art and Science, and in a particular Manner to Dramatick Performances, is too well known to the World for me to mention it here. Allow me only to wish, that what I have now the Honour to offer your
<pb n="v" facs="5"/>
ROYAL HIGHNESS may be judged not unworthy of your Protection, at least in the <hi>Sentiments</hi> which it inculcates. A warm and grateful Sense of your Goodness to me makes me desirous to seize every Occasion of declaring in Publick, with what profound Respect and dutiful Attachment, I am,</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>BOLD is the Man! who, in this nicer Age,</l>
<l>Presumes to tread the chaste corrected Stage.</l>
<l>Now, with gay tinsel Arts, we can no more</l>
<l>Conceal the Want of Nature's sterling Ore.</l>
<l>Our Spells are vanish'd, broke our magic Wand,</l>
<l>That us'd to waft you over Sea and Land.</l>
<l>Before your <hi>Light</hi> the fairy People fade,</l>
<l>The Demons fly—The Ghost itself is laid.</l>
<l>In vain of martial Scenes the loud Alarms,</l>
<l>The mighty Prompter thundering out to Arms,</l>
<l>The Playhouse Posse clattering from afar,</l>
<l>The close-wedg'd Battle, and the Din of War.</l>
<l>Now, even the Senate seldom we convene;</l>
<l>The yawning Fathers nod behind the Scene.</l>
<l>Your Taste rejects the glittering false Sublime,</l>
<l>To sigh in Metaphor, and die in Rhime.</l>
<l>High <hi>Rant</hi> is tumbled from his Gallery Throne:</l>
<l>Description, Dreams—nay Similies are gone.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>What shall we then? to please you how devise?</l>
<l>Whose Judgment sits not in your Ears and Eyes.</l>
<l>Thrice happy! could we catch great <hi>SHAKESPEAR</hi>'s Art,</l>
<l>To trace the deep Recesses of the Heart;</l>
<l>His simple plain Sublime, to which is given</l>
<l>To strike the Soul with darted Flame from Heaven:</l>
<l>Could we awake soft <hi>OTWAY</hi>'s tender Woe,</l>
<l>The Pomp of Verse and golden Lines of <hi>ROWE.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>We to your Hearts apply: let them attend;</l>
<l>Before their silent candid Bar we bend.</l>
<l>If warm'd they listen, 'tis our noblest Praise;</l>
<l>If cold, they wither all the Muse's Bays.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>SIGISMUNDA.</speaker>
<l>AH fatal Day to <hi>Sicily!</hi> The King</l>
<l>Then touches his last Moments?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>So 'tis fear'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGISMUNDA.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>The Death of those distinguish'd by their Station,</l>
<l>But by their Virtue more, awakes the Mind</l>
<l>To solemn Dread, and strikes a saddening Awe:</l>
<l>Not that we grieve for them, but for ourselves,</l>
<l>Left to the Toil of Life—And yet the Best</l>
<l>Are, by the playful Children of this World,</l>
<l>At once forgot, as they had never been.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>LAURA, 'tis said—the Heart is sometimes charg'd</l>
<l>With a prophetick Sadness: Such, methinks,</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="10"/>
Now hangs on mine. The King's approaching Death</l>
<l>Suggests a thousand Fears. What Troubles thence</l>
<l>May throw the State once more into Confusion,</l>
<l>What sudden Changes in my Father's House</l>
<l>May rise, and part me from my dearest TANCRED,</l>
<l>Alarms my Thought.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>The Fears of Love-sick Fancy!</l>
<l>Perversely busy to torment it self.</l>
<l>But be assur'd, your Father's steady Friendship,</l>
<l>Join'd to a certain Genius, that commands,</l>
<l>Not kneels to Fortune will support and cherish,</l>
<l>Here in the publick Eye of <hi>Sicily,</hi></l>
<l>This—I may call him—his adopted Son,</l>
<l>The noble TANCRED, form'd to all his Virtues.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGISMUNDA.</speaker>
<l>Ah form'd to charm his Daughter!—This fair Morn</l>
<l>Has tempted far the Chace. Is he not yet</l>
<l>Return'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>No.—When your Father to the King,</l>
<l>Who now expiring lies, was call'd in haste,</l>
<l>He sent each way his Messengers to find him;</l>
<l>With such a Look of Ardor and Impatience,</l>
<l>As if this near Event was to Count TANCRED</l>
<l>Of more Importance than I comprehend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGISMUNDA.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>There lies, my LAURA, o'er my TANCRED'S Birth</l>
<l>A Cloud I cannot pierce. With princely Cost,</l>
<l>Nay, with Respect, which oft I have observ'd,</l>
<l>Stealing at times submissive o'er his Features,</l>
<l>In <hi>Belmont's</hi> Woods my Father rear'd this Youth—</l>
<l>Ah Woods! where first my artless Bosom learnt</l>
<l>The Sighs of Love.—He gives him out the Son</l>
<l>Of an old Friend, a Baron of <hi>Apulia,</hi></l>
<l>Who in the late Crusado b avely fell.</l>
<l>But then 'tis strange; is all his Family</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="11"/>
As well as Father dead? and all their Friends,</l>
<l>Except my Sire, the generous good SIFFREDI?</l>
<l>Had he a Mother, Sister, Brother left,</l>
<l>The last Remain of Kindred, with what Pride,</l>
<l>What Rapture, might they fly o'er Earth and Sea,</l>
<l>To claim this rising Honour of their Blood!</l>
<l>This bright Unknown! this all-accomplish'd Youth!</l>
<l>Who charms—too much—the Heart of SIGISMUNDA!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>LAURA, perhaps your Brother knows him better,</l>
<l>The Friend and Partner of his freest Hours.</l>
<l>What says RODOLPHO? Does he truely credit</l>
<l>This Story of his Birth?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>He has sometimes,</l>
<l>Like you, his Doubts; yet, when maturely weigh'd,</l>
<l>Believes it true. As for Lord TANCRED'S Self,</l>
<l>He never entertain'd the slightest Thought</l>
<l>That verg'd to Doubt; but oft laments his State,</l>
<l>By cruel Fortune so ill-pair'd to yours.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGISMUNDA.</speaker>
<l>Merit like his, the Fortune of the Mind,</l>
<l>Beggars all Wealth—Then to your Brother, LAURA,</l>
<l>He talks of me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>Of nothing else. Howe'er</l>
<l>The Talk begin, it ends with SIGISMUNDA.</l>
<l>Their Morning, Noon-tide, and their Evening Walks</l>
<l>Are full of you; and all the Woods of <hi>Belmont</hi></l>
<l>Inamour'd with your Name—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGISMUNDA.</speaker>
<l>Away, my Friend;</l>
<l>You flatter—yet the dear Delusion charms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>No, SIGISMUNDA, 'tis the strictest Truth,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="12"/>
Nor half the Truth, I tell you. Even with Fondness</l>
<l>My Brother talks for ever of the Passion,</l>
<l>That fires young TANCRED'S Breast. So much it strikes him,</l>
<l>He praises Love as if he were a Lover.</l>
<l>He blames the false Pursuits of vagrant Youth,</l>
<l>Calls them gay Folly, a mistaken Struggle</l>
<l>Against best-judging Nature. Heaven, he says,</l>
<l>In lavish Bounty form'd the Heart for Love;</l>
<l>In Love included all the finer Seeds</l>
<l>Of Honour, Virtue, Friendship, purest Bliss—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGISMUNDA.</speaker>
<l>Virtuous RODOLPHO!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>Then his pleasing Theme</l>
<l>He varies to the Praises of your Lover—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGISMUNDA.</speaker>
<l>And what, my LAURA, says he on that Subject?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>He says that, tho' he were not nobly born,</l>
<l>Nature has form'd him noble, generous, brave,</l>
<l>Truely magnanimous, and warmly scorning</l>
<l>Whatever bears the smallest Taint of Baseness:</l>
<l>That every easy Virtue is his own;</l>
<l>Not learnt by painful Labour, but inspir'd,</l>
<l>Implanted in his Soul—Chiefly one Charm</l>
<l>He in his graceful Character observes:</l>
<l>That tho' his Passions burn with high Impatience,</l>
<l>And sometimes, from a noble Heat of Nature,</l>
<l>Are ready to fly off, yet the least Check</l>
<l>Of ruling Reason brings them back to Temper,</l>
<l>And gentle Softness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIGISMUNDA.</speaker>
<l>True! O true, RODOLPHO!</l>
<l>Blest be thy kindred Worth for loving his!</l>
<l>He is all Warmth, all amiable Fire,</l>
<l>All quick Heroic Ardor! temper'd soft</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="13"/>
With Gentleness of Heart, and manly Reason!</l>
<l>If Virtue were to wear a human Form,</l>
<l>To light it with her Dignity and Flame,</l>
<l>Then softening mix her Smiles and tender Graces,</l>
<l>O she would chuse the Person of my TANCRED!</l>
<l>Go on, my Friend, go on, and ever praise him;</l>
<l>The Subject knows no Bounds, nor can I tire,</l>
<l>While my Breast trembles to that sweetest Musick!</l>
<l>The Heart of Woman tastes no truer Joy,</l>
<l>Is never flatter'd with such dear Enchantment—</l>
<l>'Tis more than selfish Vanity—as when</l>
<l>She hears the Praises of the Man she loves—</l>
</sp>

<speaker>SIGISMUNDA.</speaker>
<l>How bright must then be his!—This Stroke is sudden.</l>
<l>He was this Morning well, when to the Chace</l>
<l>Lord TANCRED went.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIFFREDI.</speaker>
<l>'Tis true. But at his Years</l>
<l>Death gives short Notice—Dropping Nature then,</l>
<l>Without a Gust of Pain to shake it, falls.</l>
<l>His Death, my Daughter, was that happy Period</l>
<l>Which few attain. The Duties of his Day</l>
<l>Were all discharg'd, and gratefully enjoy'd</l>
<l>It's noblest Blessings; calm, as Evening Skies,</l>
<l>Was his pure Mind, and lighted up with Hopes</l>
<l>That open Heaven; when, for his last long Sleep</l>
<l>Timely prepar'd, a Lassitude of Life,</l>
<l>A pleasing Weariness of mortal Joy,</l>
<l>Fell on his Soul, and down he sunk to Rest.</l>
<l>O may my Death be such!—He but one Wish</l>
<l>Left unfulfill'd, which was to see Count TANCRED—</l>

<l>Why did you start at Mention of Count TANCRED?</l>

<speaker>SIGISMUNDA.</speaker>
<l>Nothing—I only hop'd the dying King</l>

<l>For this your worthy Charge, this noble Orphan.</l>

And I will tell thee, in a few plain Words,</l>
<l>How he deserv'd that best that glorious Title.</l>
<l>'Tis nought complex, 'tis clear as Truth and Virtue.</l>
<l>He lov'd his People, deem'd them all his Children;</l>
<l>The Good exalted and depress'd the Bad.</l>
<l>He spurn'd the flattering Crew, with Scorn rejected</l>
<l>Their smooth Advice that only means themselves,</l>
<l>Their Schemes to aggrandize him into Baseness:</l>
<l>Nor did he less disdain the secret Breath,</l>
<l>The whisper'd Tale, that blights a virtuous Name.</l>
<l>He sought alone the Good of Those, for whom</l>
<l>He was entrusted with the sovereign Power:</l>
<l>Well knowing that a People in their Rights</l>
<l>And Industry protected; living safe</l>
<l>Beneath the sacred Shelter of the Laws,</l>
<l>Encourag'd in their Genius, Arts, and Labours,</l>
<l>And happy each as he himself deserves,</l>
<l>Are ne'er ungrateful. With unsparing Hand</l>
<l>They will for Him provide: their filial Love</l>
<l>And Confidence are his unfailing Treasure,</l>
<l>And every honest Man his faithful Guard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TANCRED.</speaker>
<l>A general Face of Grief o'erspreads the City.</l>
<l>I mark'd the People, as I hither came,</l>
<l>In Crouds assembled, struck with silent Sorrow,</l>
<l>And pouring forth the noblest Praise of Tears.</l>
<l>Those whom Remembrance of their former Woes,</l>
<l>And long Experience of the vain Illusions</l>
<l>Of youthful Hope, had into wise Content</l>
<l>And Fear of Change corrected, wrung their Hands,</l>
<l>And often casting up their Eyes to Heaven</l>
<l>Gave sign of sad Conjecture. Others shew'd,</l>
<l>Athwart their Grief, or real or affected,</l>
<l>A Gleam of Expectation, from what Chance</l>
<l>And Change might bring. A mingled Murmur run</l>
<l>Along the Streets; and, from the lonely Court</l>

<l>TANCRED, 'tis true; she is the late King's Sister,</l>
<l>The sole surviving Offspring of that Tyrant</l>
<l>WILLIAM <hi>the Bad</hi>—so for his Vices stil'd;</l>
<l>Who spilt much noble Blood, and sore oppress'd</l>
<l>Th' exhausted Land: whence grievous Wars arose,</l>
<l>And many a dire Convulsion shook the State.</l>
<l>When He, whose Death <hi>Sicilia</hi> mourns to-day,</l>
<l>WILLIAM, who has and well deserv'd the Name</l>
<l>Of <hi>Good,</hi> succeeding to his Father's Throne,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIFFREDI.</speaker>
<l>Come nearer, noble TANCRED,</l>
<l>Son of my Care! I must, on this occasion,</l>
<l>Consult thy generous Heart; which, when conducted</l>
<l>By Rectitude of Mind and honest Virtues,</l>
<l>Gives better Counsel than the hoary Head—</l>
<l>Then know, there lives a Prince, here in <hi>Palermo,</hi></l>
<l>The lineal Offspring of our famous Heroe,</l>
<l>ROGER the First.</l>

<speaker>TANCRED.</speaker>
<l>Great Heaven!—How far remov'd</l>
<l>From that our mighty Founder?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIFFREDI.</speaker>
<l>His great Grandson:</l>
<l>Sprung from his eldest Son, who died untimely,</l>
<l>Before his Father.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TANCRED.</speaker>
<l>Ha! the Prince you mean</l>
<l>Is he not MANFRED'S Son? The generous, brave,</l>
<l>Unhappy MANFRED! whom the Tyrant WILLIAM,</l>
<l>You just now mention'd, not content to spoil</l>
<l>Of his paternal Crown, threw into Fetters,</l>
<l>And infamously murder'd.</l>
</sp>

<l>Yes—the same.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TANCRED.</speaker>
<l>By Heavens! I joy to find our <hi>Norman</hi> Reign,</l>
<l>The Light of Earth amidst these barbarous Ages!</l>
<l>Yet rears it's head; and shall not, from the Lance,</l>
<l>Pass to the feeble Distaff—But this Prince</l>
<l>Where has he lain conceal'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIFFREDI.</speaker>
<l>The late good King,</l>
<l>By noble Pity mov'd, contriv'd to save him</l>
<l>From his dire Father's unrelenting Rage;</l>
<l>And had him rear'd in private, as became</l>
<l>His Birth and Hopes, with high and princely Nurture.</l>
<l>Till now, too young to rule a troubled State,</l>
<l>By Civil Broils most miserably torn,</l>
<l>He in his safe Retreat has lain conceal'd,</l>
<l>His Birth and Fortune to himself unknown;</l>
<l>But when the dying King to me entrusted,</l>
<l>As to the Chancellor of the Realm, his Will,</l>
<l>His Successor he nam'd him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TANCRED.</speaker>
<l>Happy Youth!</l>
<l>He then will triumph o'er his Father's Foes,</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="19"/>
O'er haughty OSMOND, and the Tyrant's Daughter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIFFREDI.</speaker>
<l>Ay, That is what I dread—that Heat of Youth;</l>
<l>There lurks, I fear, Perdition to the State.</l>
<l>I dread the Horrors of rekindled War:</l>
<l>Tho' dead, the Tyrant still is to be fear'd;</l>
<l>His Daughter's Party still is strong, and numerous:</l>
<l>Her Friend, Earl OSMOND, Constable of <hi>Sicily,</hi></l>
<l>Experienc'd, brave, high-born, of mighty Interest.</l>
<l>Better the Prince and Princess should by Marriage</l>
<l>Unite their Friends, their Interest and their Claims:</l>
<l>Then will the Peace and Welfare of the Land</l>
<l>On a firm Basis rise.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TANCRED.</speaker>
<l>My Lord SIFFREDI,</l>
<l>If by myself I of this Prince may judge,</l>
<l>That Scheme will scarce succeed—Your prudent Age</l>
<l>In vain will counsel, if the Heart forbid it—</l>
<l>But wherefore fear? The Right is clearly his;</l>
<l>And, under your Direction, with each Man</l>
<l>Of Worth, and stedfast Loyalty, to back</l>
<l>At once the King's Appointment and his Birthright,</l>
<l>There is no ground for Fear. They have great Odds,</l>
<l>Against the astonish'd Sons of Violence,</l>
<l>Who fight with awful Justice on their Side.</l>
<l>All <hi>Sicily</hi> will rouze, all faithful Hearts</l>
<l>Will range themselves around Prince MANFRED'S Son.</l>
<l>For me, I here devote me to the Service</l>
<l>Of this young Prince; I every Drop of Blood</l>
<l>Will lose with Joy, with Transport, in his Cause—</l>
<l>Pardon my Warmth—but That, my Lord, will never</l>
<l>To this Decision come—Then find the Prince;</l>
<l>Lose not a Moment to awaken in him</l>
<l>The Royal Soul. Perhaps he now desponding</l>
<l>Pines in a Corner, and laments his Fortune;</l>
<l>That in the narrow Bounds of private Life</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="20"/>
He must confine his Aims, those swelling Virtues</l>
<l>Which from his noble Father he inherits.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIFFREDI.</speaker>
<l>Perhaps, regardless, in the common Bane</l>
<l>Of Youth he melts in Vanity and Love.</l>
<l>But if the Seeds of Virtue glow within him,</l>
<l>I will awake a higher Sense, a Love</l>
<l>That grasps the Loves and Happiness of Millions.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TANCRED.</speaker>
<l>Why that Surmise? Or should he love, SIFFREDI,</l>
<l>I doubt not, it is nobly, which will raise</l>
<l>And animate his Virtues—O permit me</l>
<l>To plead the Cause of Youth—Their Virtue oft,</l>
<l>In Pleasure's soft Enchantment lull'd a while,</l>
<l>Forgets itself; it sleeps and gayly dreams,</l>
<l>Till great Occasion rouse it: Then, all Flame,</l>
<l>It walks abroad, with heighten'd Soul and Vigour,</l>
<l>And by the Change astonishes the World.</l>
<l>Even with a kind of Sympathy, I feel</l>
<l>The Joy that waits this Prince; when all the Powers,</l>
<l>Th' expanding Heart can wish, of doing good;</l>
<l>Whatever swells Ambition, or exalts</l>
<l>The human Soul into divine Emotions,</l>
<l>All croud at once upon him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIFFREDI.</speaker>
<l>Ah, my TANCRED,</l>
<l>Nothing so easy as in Speculation,</l>
<l>And at a distance seen, the Course of Honour,</l>
<l>A fair delightful Champian strew'd with Flowers.</l>
<l>But when the Practice comes; when our fond Passions,</l>
<l>Pleasure and Pride and Self-Indulgence throw</l>
<l>Their magic Dust around, the Prospect roughens:</l>
<l>Then dreadful Passes, craggy Mountains rise,</l>
<l>Cliffs to be scal'd, and Torrents to be stem'd:</l>
<l>Then Toil ensues, and Perseverance stern;</l>
<l>And endless Combats with our grosser Sense,</l>
<l>Oft lost, and oft renew'd; and generous Pain</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="21"/>
For others felt; and, harder Lesson still!</l>
<l>Our honest Bliss for others sacrific'd;</l>
<l>And all the rugged Task of Virtue quails</l>
<l>The stoutest Heart of common Resolution.</l>
<l>Few get above this turbid Scene of Strife,</l>
<l>Few gain the Summit, breathe that purest Air,</l>
<l>That heavenly Ether, which untroubled sees</l>
<l>The Storm of Vice and Passion rage below.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TANCRED.</speaker>
<l>Most true, my Lord. But why thus augure Ill?</l>
<l>You seem to doubt this Prince. I know him not.</l>
<l>Yet oh, methinks, my Heart could answer for him!</l>
<l>The Juncture is so high, so strong the Gale</l>

<l>To nurse thee up to Virtue; who for Thee,</l>
<l>Thy Glory and thy Weal, renounces all,</l>
<l>All Interest or Ambition can pour forth;</l>

And save thy self, thy Honour, and thy People!</l>
<l>Kneeling with me, behold the many Thousands</l>
<l>To thy Protection trusted: Fathers, Mothers,</l>
<l>The sacred Front of venerable Age,</l>
<l>The tender Virgin and the helpless Infant;</l>
<l>The Ministers of Heaven, Those, who maintain,</l>
<l>Around thy Throne, the Majesty of Rule;</l>
<l>And Those, whose Labour, scorch'd by Winds and Sun,</l>
<l>Feeds the rejoicing Public: see them all,</l>
<l>Here at thy Feet, conjuring Thee to save them,</l>
<l>From Misery and War, from Crimes and Rapine!</l>
<l>Can there be aught, kind Heaven! in Self-indulgence</l>
<l>To weigh down These? This Aggregate of Love,</l>

<l>Void in itself—I saw you stung with Rage,</l>

<l>Beneath my Name an absolute Compliance</l>

<l>Now on the Point to burst, and now by Shame</l>
<l>Repress'd—But in the Face of <hi>Sicily,</hi></l>
<l>All mad with Acclamation, what, RODOLPHO,</l>

<l>I should have cast a flattering World aside,</l>

<l>Without your wise Direction may be Duty;</l>
<l>But still my Choice is free—That is a Right,</l>

<l>Ha!—yes—perhaps the King, the young Count TANCRED!</l>
<l>They were bred up together—Surely That,</l>

<l>In the most solemn Manner, to CONSTANTIA?</l>
<l>Does not his Crown depend upon the Deed?</l>
<l>No—if they lov'd, and this old Statesman knew it,</l>
<l>He could not to a King prefer a Subject.</l>

<l>Ten thousand Charms into my inmost Soul!</l>
<l>She look'd so mild, so amiably gentle,</l>
<l>She bow'd her Head, she glow'd with such Confusion,</l>
<l>Such Loveliness of Modesty! She is,</l>
<l>In gracious Mind, in Manners, and in Person,</l>
<l>The perfect Model of all female Beauty!—</l>
<l>She must be mine—She is!—If yet her Heart</l>

<l>Lord Constable,</l>
<l>Let us be stedfast in the Right; but let us</l>
<l>Act with cool Prudence, and with manly Temper,</l>
<l>As well as manly Firmness. True, I own,</l>
<l>Th' Indignities you suffer are so high,</l>
<l>As might even justify what now you threaten.</l>
<l>But if, my Lord, we can prevent the Woes</l>
<l>The cruel Horrors of intestine War,</l>
<l>Yet hold untouch'd our Liberties and Laws;</l>
<l>O let us, rais'd above the turbid Sphere</l>
<l>Of little selfish Passions, nobly do it!</l>
<l>Nor to our hot intemperate Pride pour out</l>
<l>A dire Libation of <hi>Sicilian</hi> Blood.</l>
<l>'Tis Godlike Magnanimity, to keep,</l>
<l>When most provok'd, our Reason calm and clear,</l>
<l>And execute her Will, from a strong Sense</l>
<l>Of what is right, without the vulgar Aid</l>
<l>Of Heat and Passion, which, tho' honest, bear us</l>
<l>Often too far. Remember that my House</l>
<l>Protects my Daughter still; and ere I saw her</l>

<l>This Hand should act the <hi>Roman</hi> Father's Part.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by MISS BUDGELL.</stage>
<lg>
<l>CRamm'd to the Throat with wholesome moral Stuff,</l>
<l>Alas! poor Audience! you have had enough.</l>
<l>Was ever hapless Heroine of a Play</l>
<l>In such a piteous Plight as ours To-day?</l>
<l>Was ever Woman so by Love betray'd?</l>
<l>Match'd with two Husbands, and yet—die a Maid.</l>
<l>But bless me!—hold—What Sounds are these I hear!—</l>
<l>I see the <hi>TRAGIC MUSE</hi> herself appear.</l>
</lg>
<p>The Back-Scene opens, and discovers a romantic Silvan Landskip; from which Mrs. CIBBER, in the Character of the TRAGIC MUSE, advances slowly to Musick, and speaks the following Lines.</p>
<lg>
<l>Hence with your flippant Epilogue, that tries</l>
<l>To wipe the virtuous Tear from <hi>BRITISH</hi> Eyes;</l>
<l>That dares my moral Tragic Scene profane,</l>
<l>With Strains—at best, unsuiting, light and vain.</l>
<l>Hence from the pure unsully'd Beams that play</l>
<l>In yon fair Eyes, where Virtue shines—Away!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l><hi>BRITONS,</hi> to you from chaste <hi>Castalian</hi> Groves,</l>
<l>Where dwell the tender, oft unhappy Loves;</l>
<l>Where Shades of Heroes roam, each mighty Name,</l>
<l>And court my Aid to rise again to Fame;</l>
<l>To you I come, to Freedom's noblest Seat,</l>
<l>And in <hi>BRITANNIA</hi> fix my last Retreat.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>In <hi>GREECE,</hi> and <hi>ROME,</hi> I watch'd the Publick Weal;</l>
<l>The purple Tyrant trembled at my Steel:</l>
<l>Nor did I less o'er private Sorrows reign,</l>
<l>And mend the melting Heart with softer Pain.</l>
<l>On <hi>FRANCE</hi> and <hi>YOU</hi> then rose my brightning Star,</l>
<l>With social Ray—The <hi>ARTS</hi> are ne'er at War.</l>
<l>O as your Fire and Genius stronger blaze,</l>
<l>As yours are generous Freedom's bolder Lays,</l>
<l>Let not the <hi>Gallick</hi> Taste leave yours behind,</l>
<l>In decent Manners and in Life refin'd;</l>
<l>Banish the motley Mode, to tag low Verse,</l>
<l>The laughing Ballad to the mournful Herse.</l>
<l>When thro' five Acts your Hearts have learnt to glow,</l>
<l>Touch'd with the sacred Force of honest Woe;</l>
<l>O keep the dear Impression on your Breast,</l>
<l>Nor idly lose it for a wretched Jest!</l>
