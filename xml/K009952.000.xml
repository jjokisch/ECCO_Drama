<head>PROLOGUE,</head>
<byline>Written by —</byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. GARRICK.</byline>
<lg>
<l>IF in these days of luxury and case,</l>
<l>A tale from Sparta's rigid state can please;</l>
<l>If patriot plans a British breast can warm;</l>
<l>If Kings asserting liberty can charm;</l>
<l>If Virtue still a grateful aspect wear;</l>
<l>Check not at Agis' fall the gen'rous tear.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>He view'd his subjects with a parent's love;</l>
<l>With zeal to save a sinking people strove;</l>
<l>Strove their chang'd hearts with glory to inflame;</l>
<l>To mend their Morals; and restore their name:</l>
<l>Till Faction rose with Murder at her side;</l>
<l>Then mourn'd his country; persever'd; and died.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>That country once for virtue was rever'd;</l>
<l>Admir'd by Greece; by haughty Asia fear'd.</l>
<l>Then Citizens and Soldiers were the same;</l>
<l>And soldiers heroes; for their wealth was fame.</l>
<l>Then for the Brave the Fair reserv'd her charms;</l>
<l>And scorn'd to clasp a toward in her arms.</l>
<l>The trumpet call'd; she seiz'd the sword and shield;</l>
<l>Array'd in haste her husband for the field;</l>
<l>And sighing whisper'd in a fond embrace,</l>
<l>"Remember!—death is better than disgrace.</l>
<l>The widow'd Mother shew'd her parting son</l>
<l>The race of glory which his sire had run.</l>
<l>"My son, thy fight alone I shall deplore.</l>
<l>"Return victorious!—or return no more!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>While Beauty thus with patriot zeal combin'd,</l>
<l>And round the laurel'd head her myrtle twin'd;</l>
<l>Whilst all confest the Virtuous were the Great;</l>
<l>Fame, Valor, Conquest, grac'd the Spartan state.</l>
<l><pb facs="4"/>
Her Pow'r congenial with her Virtue grew,</l>
<l>And freedom's Banner o'er her Phalanx flew;</l>
<l>But soon as Virtue dropt her sick'ning head,</l>
<l>Fame, Valor, Conquest, Pow'r and Freedom fled.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>May this sad scene improve each Briton's heart!</l>
<l>Rouse him with warmth to act a Briton's part!</l>
<l>Prompt him with Sparta's noblest sons to vie;</l>
<l>To live in glory; and in freedom die!</l>

<head>ACT I. SCENE I.</head>
<stage><hi>A court and hall, common to the palaces of the kings of</hi> SPARTA.</stage>
<sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SANDANE <hi>attended.</hi></stage>
<l>HASTEN, ORONTES, to the senate house,</l>
<l>And learn if rumor's voice has spoke the truth.</l>
<stage>[Exit Attendant.</stage>
<l>The adverse fortune of an exil'd king</l>
<l>Pursues my lord. Achaia's generous aid</l>
<l>Sustains his cause in vain. Why risk a battle,</l>
<l>When the continuance of defensive war</l>
<l>Secur'd success and victory in Sparta?</l>
<l>Would I had never left thy splendid court,</l>
<l>Delightful Sardis! to be Sparta's queen.</l>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> AMPHARES.</stage>
<l>Welcome, AMPHARES! Have the armies met?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="6"/>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>They have. This morning, at the break of day,</l>
<l>The Spartan army charged Achaia's host.</l>
<l>This and no more is known. Suspense and fear</l>
<l>Possess the people; to the gates they run,</l>
<l>Then to their houses: the still whisper spreads</l>
<l>Thro' justling multitudes the dread alarm.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SANDANE.</speaker>
<l>Alas! revenge and empire now depend</l>
<l>On the wild issue of unruly war.</l>
<l>What if the arms of AGIS should prevail?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>Although he should, the toils of fate surround him.</l>
<l>Dauntless and firm our brave associates stand,</l>
<l>And with impatience wait the destin'd hour</l>
<l>To rush on AGIS. This unlook'd-for battle</l>
<l>Is but a solemn prelude to the act,</l>
<l>Which bold conspiracy will soon perform.</l>
<l>This day shall terminate the reign of AGIS,</l>
<l>And make, O Queen! all power in Sparta thine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SANDANE.</speaker>
<l>I see that danger only whets the brave.</l>
<l>But yet, AMPHARES, if my lord is vanquish'd,</l>
<l>Will not the conquering army awe the city?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>AGIS shall be the surety of our cause,</l>
<l>And hostage for our safety, till we wrest</l>
<l>The sword from proud LYSANDER, if he conquers;</l>
<l>But that I fear not much. New to command</l>
<l>From idle Athens the mock hero comes,</l>
<l>Starts up a soldier, and a statesman too;</l>
<l>Each palm he claims: All honours must adorn</l>
<l>The chosen friend of visionary AGIS.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SANDANE.</speaker>
<l>May Mars direct him so to guide the war,</l>
<l>As AGIS rules the state: And mutiny</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="7"/>
Prove there as fatal as sedition here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>This factious state must change its feeble form,</l>
<l>Waver no more beneath a double reign</l>
<l>Of limited, contending, useless kings.</l>
<l>Henceforth our monarch shall in Sparta rule,</l>
<l>As Jove alone in high Olympus reigns.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SANDANE.</speaker>
<l>So reign the mighty monarchs of the East;</l>
<l>And such imperial power, I thought, belong'd</l>
<l>To Sparta's king, else I had ne'er been queen.</l>
<l>Young, and deceiv'd, I left my father's court</l>
<l>For Lacedaemon's miserable sceptre.</l>
<l>I did endeavour to extend its sway,</l>
<l>And to ambition rous'd my Spartan lord.</l>
<l>But the vain pupil of the Grecian schools,</l>
<l>Unprincely AGIS, marr'd the brave design.</l>
<l>Chief of the multitude, idol and slave</l>
<l>Of the base populace, he led the herd,</l>
<l>He urged their brutal fury on the king.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>And now their fury on himself recoils.</l>
<l>Like the unruly elephant, they turn,</l>
<l>And trample down the ranks in which they fought.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SANDANE.</speaker>
<l>That is their Liberty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>Let us employ,</l>
<l>And then suppress, such formidable licence.</l>
<l>My magistracy now is near expir'd;</l>
<l>A king's resentment and a rival's hate</l>
<l>Have long hung over my devoted head:</l>
<l>Farewel to place, to dignity, and power,</l>
<l>Whilst haughty AGIS fills the Spartan throne.</l>
<l>I will not live obscure in Lacedaemon,</l>
<l>Nor roam thro' Grecian states a banish'd man.</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="8"/>
If I must set, to rise and shine no more,</l>
<l>A fiery track shall mark my setting sun.</l>
<l>But AGIS comes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SANDANE.</speaker>
<l>And AGESISTRATA.</l>
<l>Farewel! Success attend thee, brave AMPHARES!</l>
<l>I will not stay. My soul disdains to hide</l>
<l>Its hatred or its scorn.</l>
<stage><hi>[Exit</hi> SANDANE.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>Yet they who mean</l>
<l>To gratify these passions, must conceal them.</l>
<l>This day decides my fate. So let it be,</l>
<l>Such brief conclusion have I ever lov'd.</l>
<l>Assist me, Hermes, God of stratagem,</l>
<l>With artful words, to sooth the mind of AGIS,</l>
<l>And turn him from the track my purpose holds.</l>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> AGIS <hi>and</hi> AGESISTRATA.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGESISTRATA.</speaker>
<l>Alas, my son! that bold bad man I dread!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGIS.</speaker>
<l>He seems to wait us. At this hour, AMPHARES,</l>
<l>I think that thou of all men shou'dst have shunn'd me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>My motive in attending here your presence</l>
<l>Merits a less injurious salutation.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGIS.</speaker>
<l>I know thy merits, and I will reward them.</l>
<l>Art thou not author of the woes of Sparta,</l>
<l>Prime mover and inflamer of sedition?</l>
<l>Hast thou not bent the power of thy high office</l>
<l>To the subversion of the state thou serv'st?</l>
<l>At thee this day my indignation burns.</l>
<l>I am dishonour'd—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="9"/>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>What has dishonour'd thee?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGIS.</speaker>
<l>Thou and thy practices, they have compell'd me</l>
<l>To leave the noblest station of a prince.</l>
<l>In time of war where should a king be found</l>
<l>But at his army's head? There AGIS stood,</l>
<l>When you and your presumptuous Ephori</l>
<l>Required my presence here. Ungrateful Spartans!</l>
<l>Had you allow'd me but one other day,</l>
<l>Then had I fought this battle for my country,</l>
<l>And died or conquer'd with her bravest sons.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGESISTRATA.</speaker>
<l>Peril, my son! dwells not in camps alone:</l>
<l>In cities, palaces, and courts of justice,</l>
<l>With treachery and treason she inhabits.</l>
<l>Peril attended thus thou must encounter,</l>
<l>More hideous sure than in the ranks of war.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>I know my actions have incens'd the king</l>
<l>But I imagin'd not that such suspicions</l>
<l>Found entertainment in your royal breasts?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGIS.</speaker>
<l>Hast thou not join'd the enemies of AGIS?</l>
<l>Thou who wast once his friend, inconstant man.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>I have oppos'd the counsel of a foe,</l>
<l>Whose arts depriv'd me of my prince's favour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGIS.</speaker>
<l>Thou hast oppos'd LYCURGUS and the laws,</l>
<l>Which rais'd the name of Sparta to the skies.</l>
<l>The Delphic God inspir'd the deep design:</l>
<l>For more than human was that power of thought</l>
<l>Which join'd the public to the private good,</l>
<l>With such perfection, that each selfish passion</l>
<l>Flow'd in the channel of the common welfare,</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="10"/>
And, like one family of sons and sires,</l>
<l>And dearest brothers, a great people liv'd.</l>
<l>In peace they liv'd without or strife or scorn,</l>
<l>In war they fought to conquer, or to die.</l>
<l>Equal and free, our happy fathers knew</l>
<l>No interest but the interest of the state;</l>
<l>No gain but Sparta's glory; proud they bore</l>
<l>That palm aloft, and shar'd the high respect,</l>
<l>The admiration, which consenting Greece</l>
<l>Paid to th' imperial virtue of their country.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>Revolving time that system overthrew,</l>
<l>And chang'd the manners and the laws of Sparta.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGIS.</speaker>
<l>The laws have been neglected, not annull'd,</l>
<l>And corrupt rulers have corrupted manners.</l>
<l>Authority will soon revive the laws,</l>
<l>And great example yet restore the manners,</l>
<l>In spite of those who have oppress'd their country,</l>
<l>Depriv'd the people of their antient rights,</l>
<l>And while the nation sunk beneath their sway,</l>
<l>Still strove for power in a declining kingdom,</l>
<l>Still sought for wealth in an impoverish'd land.</l>
<l>Even at this hour rapacious they persist,</l>
<l>And, like some wretches in a stranded vessel,</l>
<l>Plunder and riot in the midst of ruin.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>Mov'd by the present perils of the state,</l>
<l>This signal hour I chose, unknown as yet</l>
<l>The fortune of the field, to change my conduct,</l>
<l>And make an offer of my aid to AGIS.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGIS.</speaker>
<l>If I should judge the future by the past,</l>
<l>Thou must forgive me, tho' I doubt thy faith.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="11"/>
<speaker>AGESISTRATA.</speaker>
<l>Yet hear him, AGIS: in an hour like this</l>
<l>He who assistance offers is a friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGIS.</speaker>
<l>This hour may yet deceive their country's foes.</l>
<l>I know the base foundation of that hope</l>
<l>Which makes my baffled enemies presume.</l>
<l>LYSANDER's army in its ranks contains</l>
<l>The best and bravest of Laconia's sons;</l>
<l>The faction wish and hope defeat to them,</l>
<l>That Sparta's generous youth may ne'er return</l>
<l>To guard that freedom which has made them brave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>The boldness of their hopes their deeds will prove</l>
<l>In the assembly, if Achaia conquer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGESISTRATA.</speaker>
<l>AMPHARES, say, what is their utmost aim?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>The old dependants of the exil'd king,</l>
<l>And all the venal members of the state,</l>
<l>Won by SANDANE's arts and foreign gold,</l>
<l>Aim to restore LEONIDAS, who comes</l>
<l>With hostile armies to enslave his country:</l>
<l>Therefore SANDANE's proffers I rejected,</l>
<l>Have warn'd the king, and would have serv'd him too;</l>
<l>But since resentment and distrust prevent me,</l>
<l>Neutral I stand, and will not seek that welcome</l>
<l>Which his more artful enemies would give.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGIS.</speaker>
<l>Thou speak'st more boldly than becomes AMPHARES.</l>
<l>Add that to the offences I forgive.</l>
<l>It is the sacred maxim of my reign,</l>
<l>That in a prince's consecrated breast</l>
<l>Revenge and anger should not long remain.</l>
<l>These passions in a king afflict the state,</l>
<l>By driving rash offenders to despair.</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="12"/>
This day decides your character with me.</l>
<l>Now let your actions prove your words sincere.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>No other terms I ask, and sure I am</l>
<l>Ne'er shall AMPHARES need again forgiveness.</l>
<stage><hi>[Exit</hi> AMPHARES.</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>AGIS.</speaker>
<l>Well has he judg'd the season of submission.</l>
<l>He will assist us if LYSANDER conquers.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGESISTRATA.</speaker>
<l>May Jove avert the evils which I fear!</l>
<l>I dread the ruin of the Spartan state,</l>
<l>And fear the downfal of our antient house.</l>
<l>The blackest fury of the Stygian realm,</l>
<l>The most destructive, is infernal Discord.</l>
<l>Bath'd in the blood of kings she walks this world,</l>
<l>And tumbles states and empires to the ground.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGIS.</speaker>
<l>Nations oft perish by their princes crime;</l>
<l>But now if Sparta's antient state must fall,</l>
<l>Gods and good men shall witness for its king,</l>
<l>That he with fate contended for his people,</l>
<l>And on the ruins of their virtue sell.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AGESISTRATA.</speaker>
<l>Think not I mean to blame your high design,</l>
<l>Age has not chang'd the tenor of my mind,</l>
<l>Nor pall'd my admiration of true glory.</l>
<l>Sprung, like thy father, from Alcides' blood,</l>
<l>I feel the spirit of the Spartan line.</l>
<l>Only let me adjure thee to beware,</l>
<l>And walk with caution thro' surrounding perils.</l>
<l>Tho' thou despisest every form of danger,</l>
<l>Think what a helpless train attends on thee,</l>
<l>An aged mother, and an infant son.</l>

<l>A spotless choir of matrons and of virgins,</l>
<l>Who o'er their country mourn, myself will lead</l>
<l>To the high temple of the son of Jove.</l>

<l>I need thee now, LYSANDER! O my friend!</l>
<l>I lean on thee, and thou perhaps art fall'n.</l>
<l>Ye ever-living gods, who know my heart,</l>
<l>I trust in you, for righteous are my thoughts,</l>
<l>All bent on raising up long-prostrate Sparta.</l>
<l>With Sparta too, I would be proud to rise,</l>
<l>And gain such glory as my fathers gain'd,</l>
<l>When Persia's tyrant trembled at their arms.</l>

<l>That tender name, and names that wait upon it,</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SANDANE.</stage>
<l>O Queen! a stranger thy protection claims,</l>
<l>Altho' thy lord, thy friends, are foes to mine,</l>
<l>Yet thou wilt sympathize with thy own sex,</l>
<l>And save me from the violence I fear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Where is thy lover to defend thee now?</l>
<l>Where is the conquering valour of LYSANDER?</l>

<l>So young, so fair a captive may subdue</l>

<l>Are these a woman's words?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SANDANE.</speaker>
<l>They are, and suited to a light adventurer,</l>
<l>Who left her parents, and her native land,</l>
<l>To seek a lover. Sure her roving mind,</l>
<l>True to its passion, may the object change,</l>

<l>I am not yet a captive; I may live</l>

<l>LYSANDER comes to rescue, or revenge.</l>

<l>Does AGIS live?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUANTHE.</speaker>
<l>Amidst the clash of arms,</l>
<l>And cries of fighting men, I heard them shout</l>
<l>The name of AGIS. By-and-by a Spartan,</l>
<l>Flying and wounded, as he pass'd call'd out,</l>
<l>"The king is safe; the king has gain'd the temple."</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER.</speaker>
<l>Then all is safe; for Sparta lives in him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUANTHE.</speaker>
<l>But the good Queen!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER.</speaker>
<l>Her sex, her age protects her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUANTHE.</speaker>
<l>Heaven grant they may; an impious band in arms</l>
<l>Pursu'd the holy train. Fear gave me speed,</l>
<l>For I outstript them all. But now, LYSANDER,</l>
<l>Betray'd, encompass'd, now what shall we do?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER.</speaker>
<l>Wert thou but safely plac'd, LYSANDER knows</l>
<l>What he should do. I must not tarry here.</l>
<l>There is a temple in this spacious city,</l>
<l>For sanctity above all others fam'd,</l>
<l>To Juno sacred, the avenging Queen!</l>
<l>Thither a trusty slave of AGIS' house</l>
<l>Will guide thy steps; by my command he waits</l>
<l>Without the palace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUANTHE.</speaker>
<l>Whither dost thou go?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER.</speaker>
<l>In this inglorious garb disguis'd, I wait</l>
<l>Till night and darkness come; then I attempt</l>
<l><pb n="32" facs="36"/>
The wall where'er I find it slightly guarded.</l>
<l>What mortal arm shall then oppose my way,</l>
<l>Urg'd as I am? Alas, my lov'd EUANTHE!</l>
<l>From my compliance with thy fond request</l>
<l>Springs the worst evil of this dreadful hour.</l>
<l>I have betray'd the confidence of AGIS:</l>
<l>But I'll repair my fault.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUANTHE.</speaker>
<l>What dost thou mean?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER.</speaker>
<l>AGIS commanded me to leave the city,</l>
<l>And thinks, would to the Gods he thought aright!</l>
<l>That his LYSANDER heads the Spartan troops,</l>
<l>In whom his only hope of safety lies.</l>
<l>But I, EUANTHE! partial to thy will,</l>
<l>Sought thee in vain. In that unhappy time</l>
<l>They seiz'd the gates, and shut me up in Sparta.</l>
<l>Fate punishes with too severe a doom</l>
<l>The human weakness of indulgent love.</l>
<l>AGIS! I come!—For the deep voices now</l>
<l>Of duty, friendship, gratitude, and glory,</l>
<l>Sound thro' my breast, and from my beating heart</l>
<l>Their echo rings. Farewel! my love, farewel!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUANTHE.</speaker>
<l>Not yet, LYSANDER! AGIS is opprest,</l>
<l>And Sparta too. Does duty, or does honour,</l>
<l>Require LYSANDER, like an eastern slave,</l>
<l>To fall attendant on the royal pile?</l>
<l>What can you do? The army will betray you:</l>
<l>So with the few, the faithful few that love you,</l>
<l>You'll do some desperate action, and be slain.</l>
<l>If you despise your life, yet think of me,</l>
<l>The prey of curst AMPHARES.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER.</speaker>
<l>Infernal Gods!</l>
<l>Let me not think of that. Retire, EUANTHE,</l>
<l><pb n="33" facs="37"/>
And in the hallow'd temple rest secure.</l>
<l>This night I'll force ill guarded Sparta's gates,</l>
<l>And save my prince, my country, and EUANTHE.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUANTHE.</speaker>
<l>Thy prince, thy country are already lost.</l>
<l>O listen, and preserve thyself and me:</l>
<l>The ship that bore me to the Spartan shore</l>
<l>Rides still at anchor: leave this wretched land.</l>
<l>Where'er thou goest I will attend thy steps;</l>
<l>Thy gods shall be my gods; thy people, mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER.</speaker>
<l>Alas! EUANTHE does not see the shame,</l>
<l>The ruin of that counsel love inspires.</l>
<l>Th' eternal gods repose this hour in me</l>
<l>No common trust: Upon my deeds depend</l>
<l>The fate of AGIS, and the fate of Sparta.</l>
<l>My soldiers too, my brave, my faithful soldiers,</l>
<l>The meanest warrior of the royal band</l>
<l>Freely devotes his life to godlike AGIS.</l>
<l>And shall their leader, shall the friend of AGIS;</l>
<l>Forsake his prince? I will forget thy words;</l>
<l>Repeat them not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EUANTHE.</speaker>
<l>Is this LYSANDER's love?</l>
<l>Must I not speak? Is my reward reproach?</l>
<l>For you I left my friends and native land,</l>
<l>Defy'd all danger, and all censure scorn'd;</l>
<l>Now in my sore distress I call on thee</l>
<l>For whom I suffer, to protect my honour,</l>
<l>And in my sore distress dost thou upbraid me?</l>
<l>If ever maid, like credulous EUANTHE,</l>
<l>Bursts all the bonds of nature for one man,</l>

<l>I'll bear thee hence, and go with thee to Athens,</l>
<l>Restore thee to thy country and thy friends,</l>
<l>Of whom thou dost complain I have bereft thee.</l>
<l>LYSANDER will acquit himself to thee,</l>
<l>And to mankind—</l>

<speaker>EUANTHE.</speaker>
<l>Delude me not. Alas!</l>
<l>Thy tongue speaks comfort; but thy voice, thy looks,</l>
<l>Wild and unsettled, drive me to despair:</l>
<l>For thou, methinks, art desperate, LYSANDER.</l>
<l>Those lips that quiver, and those eyes that roll</l>
<l>Like dragon's eyes, those are not signs of love!</l>
<l>Thou say'st that thou wilt bear me back to Athens;</l>
<l>Will that acquit thee, if thou leav'st me there?</l>
<l>Is that thy purpose?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER.</speaker>
<l>Yes. I'll leave the world,</l>
<l>And death shall wipe dishonour from my name;</l>
<l>AGIS and Sparta shall forgive me then,</l>
<l>And every debt be paid.</l>
</sp>

<l>LYSANDER, no.</l>
<l>Love's victims are not of your sterner sex.</l>
<l>It is the destiny of womankind</l>
<l>Constant to live, and desolate to die.</l>
<l>To strong necessity EUANTHE yields.</l>
<l>If I should tear you from the side of AGIS,</l>
<l>I see my fate: you ne'er would love me more:</l>
<l>Tho' you should live, yet you would die to me.</l>

Could have contriv'd to hasten his destruction,</l>

<l>Hadst thou not fled, thou coward, from my sword,</l>

<l>Had baffled all the craft of false AMPHARES.</l>

<l>This pride becomes thee, and thy lost condition.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER.</speaker>
<l>In this condition it becomes me best</l>

<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>Plead'st thou for pity?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER.</speaker>
<l>For none that thou can'st give. Hear me, then judge,</l>
<l>If what I speak is meant to win thy favour.</l>
<l>I should have pitied thee by fate subdued:</l>
<l>Opprest with crimes, thy spirit would have shrunk</l>
<l>Under calamity, and guilt have marr'd</l>
<l>The noble vigor and the port of manhood.</l>
<l>Amidst thy triumph, does it not confound thee,</l>
<l>To think thou ow'st it to excess of baseness?</l>
<l>Thou hast prevail'd, because the generous AGIS</l>
<l>Would not believe there could be such a traitor.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>Oft have I heard, and often seen thy folly,</l>
<l>But now to rail is madness. With one word</l>
<l>I could impose on thee eternal silence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER.</speaker>
<l>And would—I know thee—if thou thought'st it wise.</l>
<l>Even then, as now, I should contemn thy power:</l>
<l><pb n="40" facs="44"/>
But know, I fear thee not. The king is safe,</l>
<l>And his victorious troops at break of day</l>
<l>Will thunder in thine ears: thou and thy band</l>
<l>Will ill sustain the shock of such an host.</l>
<l>My life is in thy hands, but yet beware,</l>

<l>The temple is begirt with Thracian bands,</l>

<l>What has befallen LYSANDER. I will send</l>

<sp>

<l>I will not hear thee plead so bad a cause.</l>
<l>Is there a bond in nature like the tie</l>
<l>Which binds the hearts of brothers? And will EUXUS,</l>
<l>From vain ideas of fidelity</l>

<l>And, like the parent bird hov'ring too near</l>
<l>Its captive young, thy noble life is lost!—</l>
<l>Forgive these tears, my country! AGIS weeps</l>
<l>For thee. Alas! thy brave defender's gone!</l>
<l>O Lacedaemon, thou art fallen for ever!</l>
<l>Thy bad estate shall every day grow worse;</l>
<l>Successive tyrants shall exhaust thy strength,</l>
<l>Till all thy generous youths have bled in vain;</l>
<l>At last the consummation of thy woes</l>

<l>Shall stretch the iron arm of conquest forth,</l>
<l>And grasp thee in the circle of his empire.</l>
<l>My native land, the kingdom of my fathers,</l>
<l>Shall be no more a nation! O my country,</l>

<l>You mean to take advantage of my state,</l>
<l>Without spectator, counsellor, or friend:</l>
<l>You think I dread the stern approach of death,</l>
<l>Because the blooming season of my life</l>
<l>Still promises a long extent of years:</l>
<l>But my forefathers blood is in my veins,</l>
<l>The blood of heroes, and of Spartan kings,</l>
<l>Less only than the Gods. I dare your worst,</l>
<l>And with my dying breath acquit my people.</l>
<l>The people rose; they hearken'd to the voice</l>
<l>Of Liberty, and blest the name of AGIS.</l>
<l>But you, the nobles, an inglorious race,</l>
<l>Base as the dastard and unarmed Helots,</l>
<l>With foreign arms and mercenary aid,</l>
<l>Bore down the people, and opprest your prince,</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. PRITCHARD.</byline>
<l>A King in bloom of youth, for freedom die!</l>
<l>Our bard, tho' bold, durst not have soar'd so high.</l>
<l>This is no credulous admiring age;</l>
<l>But sacred sure the faith of Plutarch's page.</l>
<l>In simple stile that antient sage relates</l>
<l>The tale of Sparta, chief of Grecian states:</l>
<l>Eight hundred years it flourish'd, great in arms,</l>
<l>On dangers rose, and grow amidst alarms.</l>
<l>Of Sparta's triumph you have heard the cause,</l>
<l>More strong, more noble than Lycurgus' laws:</l>
<l>How Spartan Dames, by glory's charms inspir'd,</l>
<l>The son, the lover, and the husband fir'd.</l>
<l>Ye Fair of Britain's isle, which justly claims</l>
<l>The Grecian title, land of lovely dames,</l>
<l>In Britain's cause exert your matchless charms,</l>
<l>And rouse your lovers to the love of arms.</l>
<l>Hid, not extinct, the spark of valour lies;</l>
<l>Your breath shall raise it flaming to the skies.</l>
<l>Now Mars his bloody banner hangs in air,</l>
<l>And bids Britannia's sons for war prepare.</l>
<l>Let each lov'd maid, each mother bring the shield,</l>
<l>And arm their country's champions for the field.</l>
<l>Arm'd and inflam'd each British breast shall burn,</l>
<l>No youth unlaurel'd shall to you return.</l>
<l>Then shall we cease t'exult at trophies won,</l>
<l>In glory's field, by Heroes—not our own.</l>
<l>France yet shall tremble at the British sword,</l>
<l>And dread the Vengeance of her antient Lord.</l>
