<p>Were I to listen to those suggestions that naturally arise in the mind of a Writer, on the first dawnings of success, the favourable reception which this Tragedy has met with from the Public would lead me to hope that it might not be found wholly unworthy of YOUR GRACE'S Patronage: but when I reflect how many circumstances contribute to please on the Stage, where every Thought

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. SMITH.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>NEW to the stage, before this dread array,</l>
<l>Prepar'd to offer here his virgin play,</l>
<l>Our tim'rous Author, diffident of praise,</l>
<l>Grafts his first laurels on another's bays;</l>
<l>Takes from another's breast the gen'rous fire,</l>
<l>And fits to English strains a foreign lyre:</l>
<l>Aspires to please by unsuspected means,</l>
<l>Importing passion from Italian scenes;</l>
<l>Where heroes combate to soft music's note;</l>
<l>And tyrants warble thro' an eunuch's throat:</l>
<l>To symphony despairing lovers sigh;</l>
<l>And struggling traitors by the gamut die!</l>
<l>Yet here a living bard, whose fame out-runs</l>
<l>The foremost of the tunesul Drama's sons,</l>
<l>Can ev'n in song his magic pow'r dispense,</l>
<l>At once uniting harmony and sense.</l>
<l>From him our poet now essays to write,</l>
<l>And plans from him the story of to-night;</l>
<l>A well-known tale—who has not heard the name:</l>
<l>Of CYRUS, and the rising Median fame?</l>
<l>Each puling school-boy can discuss the theme;</l>
<l>The suff'ring grandson, and the monarch's dream.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>O! should his genius catch th' inspiring thought,</l>
<l>And nobly copy what was nobly wrought;</l>
<l>Or where the master's hand but sketch'd the line,</l>
<l>With happy warmth fill up the bold design;</l>
<l>Then ev'ry figure, with full force imprest,</l>
<l>May wake the feelings of th' impassion'd breast;</l>
<l>While each bright eye, amidst this circle, pays</l>
<l>The tribute of involuntary praise.</l>

<stage>MANDANE, ASPASIA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MANDANE.</speaker>
<l>BEHOLD the limits of the Median land,</l>
<l>And see the temple where Astyages</l>
<l>Returns each year to shed the victim's blood,</l>
<l>On great Astarte's altar—O! Aspasia!</l>
<l>This is the place, the day, nam'd by my father,</l>
<l>To bless me with the tenderest interview;</l>
<l>Here shall I meet again my long lost Cyrus:</l>
<l>Is he not found, was he not snatch'd from death,</l>
<l>Sav'd by some God to fill these eager arms!</l>
<l>And is not this the happy destin'd grove,</l>
<l>Where once again I shall embrace my child?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
<speaker>ASPASIA.</speaker>
<l>'Tis true—but what can all this passion mean?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANDANE.</speaker>
<l>What can it mean!—where is my Cyrus hid?</l>
<l>What does he?—wherefore comes he not?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ASPASIA.</speaker>
<l>Alas!</l>
<l>Time, wing'd with swiftest pinions, lags behind</l>
<l>The ardent wishes of a mother's love.</l>
<l>Thou know'st the hour of sacrifice is fix'd</l>
<l>For his reception; that we must not pay</l>
<l>Our vows to night's pale queen, till yonder sun</l>
<l>Declines to ev'ning skies, and now his beams</l>
<l>But just begin to dawn o'er eastern hills.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANDANE.</speaker>
<l>Alas! Aspasia,—still I fear—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ASPASIA.</speaker>
<l>And wherefore?</l>
<l>When now Astyages no longer seeks</l>
<l>His death, but wishes to behold his Cyrus,</l>
<l>To give him back a parent's kind protection,</l>
<l>And shew, in him, our Media's future king?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANDANE.</speaker>
<l>Yet if the visions of the night may claim.</l>
<l>Belief—a dreadful dream—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ASPASIA.</speaker>
<l>And shall Mandane</l>
<l>Be mov'd with shadows! sure you should detest</l>
<l>Such visionary fears; from these you first</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="9"/>May date your sorrows: well you know, your father,</l>
<l>On the vain credit of a dream, condemn'd</l>
<l>Your Cyrus to be slain; nor this suffic'd;</l>
<l>But that the nuptial bed no more might prove</l>
<l>Fruitful to thee in children, and to him</l>
<l>Give endless cause of terror, far from hence</l>
<l>To banishment he sent your lord, your husband,</l>
<l>Your dear Cambyses, where, in Persia's realm</l>
<l>He lives, an alien to his consort's arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANDANE.</speaker>
<l>And yet 'tis not a dream that twice ten years</l>
<l>Have seen the chearful harvest crown our fields,</l>
<l>Since at his birth my child was ravish'd from me.</l>
<l>On this blest day I hope once more to see him,</l>
<l>And thinks Aspasia now to find me calm?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ASPASIA.</speaker>
<l>You lost your Cyrus when your age had scarce</l>
<l>Beheld the round of thirteen annual suns;</l>
<l>And can you still so deeply feel the grief</l>
<l>Imprest in life's first bloom?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANDANE.</speaker>
<l>Alas! Aspasia,</l>
<l>Thou know'st not what it is to be a mother.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ASPASIA.</speaker>
<l>Yet your Aspasia too has known her sorrows;</l>
<l>If you lament a husband and a son,</l>
<l>I mourn a brother's loss, who fell beneath</l>
<l>The vengeful anger of Astyages.</l>

<speaker>MANDANE.</speaker>
<l>There, there, my bosom shar'd thy father's sufferings,</l>
<l>And oft I've wept in secret his misfortunes.</l>
<l>Unhappy man! a fatal recompense</l>
<l>My father gave thee for his grandson sav'd!</l>
<l>What hast thou suffer'd for thy love to Cyrus,</l>

<l>He must not, till Astyages appears,</l>
<l>Presume to pass the borders of the kingdom:</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANDANE.</speaker>
<l>Then let us seek him out</l>

<l>Wherefore then</l>

<speaker>MANDANE.</speaker>
<l>And must Mandane</l>
<l>Attend the dull and tedious forms of state?</l>
<l>Aspasia, if thou lov'st me, instant go,</l>
<l>And seek the blooming youth—Yet stay, and hear me—</l>
<l>Observe his air, his voice, his ev'ry look;</l>
<l>Mark if his features bear his mother's likeness,</l>
<l>Or his lov'd father's—But, als! I rave;</l>
<l>Thou never knew'st his hapless banish'd father!</l>
<l>Relate my sufferings, and enquire of his:</l>
<l>Ask what kind hand supply'd a mother's care;</l>
<l>How when, Mandane, torn with heart-felt anguish,</l>
<l>Deem'd him a prey to savage rage, the woods</l>
<l>Preserv'd him in their hospitable shades.</l>
<l>Tell him—O heaven! I know not what—but tell him</l>
<l>More than a mother's fondness can express,</l>
<l>Not what I speak, but all I wish to utter.</l>
<l>O fly! and with the rapid speed of thought,</l>

<l>Restores my Cyrus to his native land;</l>
<l>Yet be deny'd to gaze with transport on him,</l>

<l>But my resentment still demands its victim:</l>
<l>Yes, dearest shade of my lamented son,</l>

<l>Thou yet shalt be appeas'd; for this so long</l>
<l>I've worn the mask of loyalty—but now</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> CYRUS <hi>and</hi> MITHRANES.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CYRUS.</speaker>
<l>Can it be possible? O say, my father,</l>
<l>For such thou still hast been, am I indeed</l>
<l>The Median Cyrus? Sure I dream! am I</l>
<l>The offspring of Cambyses and Mandane?</l>
<l>That wretched offspring, whom Astyages</l>
<l>Sentenc'd to die, when scarce the vital spirit</l>
<l>Breath'd from his infant lips.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, prince,</l>
<l>Thou art that offspring.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CYRUS.</speaker>
<l>Tell me then, Mithranes,</l>
<l>How many bear the name? Thou know'st already</l>
<l>One Cyrus, on the borders of the land</l>
<l>Is now arriv'd; and comes not here the king</l>
<l>To welcome his approach?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>The king's deceiv'd;</l>
<l>That Cyrus is but feign'd—thou art the true.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CYRUS.</speaker>
<l>Whence is this mystery?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>Astyages,</l>
<l>When thou wert yet unborn, beheld a vision</l>
<l>That fill'd his soul, with dread.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="15"/>
<speaker>CYRUS.</speaker>
<l>Of this, Mithranes,</l>
<l>Thou need'st not speak; oft have I heard it told,</l>
<l>How, from his dream, the magic had denounc'd,</l>
<l>That of Mandane should a child be born,</l>
<l>That must one day deprive him of his throne;</l>
<l>And well I know at Cyrus' luckless birth,</l>
<l>The rigid charge was given to Harpagus,</l>
<l>To end his life, and ease a monarch's fears,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>From thence begins a tale thou ne'er hast heard:</l>
<l>The cruel sentence Harpagus receiv'd,</l>
<l>His heart refus'd to obey; to me he brought thee,</l>
<l>Wrapp'd in a regal mantle.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CYRUS.</speaker>
<l>Then 'twas thou</l>
<l>That in the woods expos'd—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>Not so—be patient—</l>
<l>My consort then (mark well the providence</l>
<l>That watch'd thy preservation) had brought forth</l>
<l>A lifeless child; thy harmless innocence</l>
<l>Excited pity; on thy tender cheek</l>
<l>Stood the big tear, as if thy heart already</l>
<l>Were conscious of misfortune, while thy hands</l>
<l>Were stretch'd, as if to implore protection, from us.</l>
<l>My Barce wept, and with a mother's fondness,</l>
<l>Clasp'd in her arms, she strain'd thee to her bosom,</l>
<l>Lull'd thee to rest, and hush'd thy little sorrows.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CRYUS?</speaker>
<l>Forgive me, sir, if gratitude awhile</l>
<l>Breaks in upon your tale, and fills my eyes</l>
<l>In dear remembrance of your Barce's virtues;</l>
<l>She whose indulgence watch'd my helpless years.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="16"/>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>Thou wert, indeed, the darling of her age.</l>
<l>As my own son I bred thee in these shades,</l>
<l>And call'd thy name Alcaeus; in thy stead,</l>
<l>Exposing in the wood the lifeless infant.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CYRUS.</speaker>
<l>What of Astyages?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>When he believ'd</l>
<l>His dire command compleated, nature's voice</l>
<l>At length awaken'd in his breast remorse.</l>
<l>Full fifteen years did Harpagus remain</l>
<l>Without disclosing aught; then seem'd the tale</l>
<l>Ripe for discovery: yet he first would prove</l>
<l>The current's depth before he left the shore.</l>
<l>Five years have now elaps'd, since thro' the realm</l>
<l>The tidings spread, that Cyrus being found</l>
<l>An infant in the forest, was preserv'd</l>
<l>And liv'd among the Scythians: such report</l>
<l>Perhaps the impostor rais'd, or from the rumour</l>
<l>Perhaps he sprung: but be it as it may,</l>
<l>Some bold adventurer, lur'd with hopes of greatness,</l>
<l>Usurps thy name.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CYRUS.</speaker>
<l>Is this the Cyrus then</l>
<l>Who comes—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>The same—but mark me—Harpagus</l>
<l>Procur'd the fiction credit with the king;</l>
<l>For thus he reason'd—should Astyages</l>
<l>With joy receive the news, I safely may</l>
<l>Reveal the kingdom's heir; or should his fears</l>
<l>Once more return, and prompt some new design</l>
<l>Against the prince, the baffled aim will light</l>
<l>Upon the impostor's head.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="17"/>
<speaker>CYRUS.</speaker>
<l>But since the king</l>
<l>Confesses now such tenderness for Cyrus;</l>
<l>At length recalls him from a life of exile,</l>
<l>To clasp him to his bosom, wakens all</l>
<l>The soft endearments in a mother's soul,</l>
<l>And every tender passion in a son;</l>
<l>Wherefore should unavailing caution still</l>
<l>Withhold the secret from him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>Harpagus</l>
<l>Relies not firmly on the royal goodness:</l>
<l>For when he own'd, that with compassion mov'd,</l>
<l>He had not slain the infant, but expos'd him</l>
<l>Amidst the woods, Astyages to punish</l>
<l>His disobedience, doom'd to cruel death</l>
<l>His only son; and though the king now seems</l>
<l>To mourn his grandson's fate, and wears the semblance</l>
<l>Of deep remorse, yet sure but ill agrees</l>
<l>Such love for thee, with such resentment shewn</l>
<l>Against thy kind preserver.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CYRUS.</speaker>
<l>Tell me ther,</l>
<l>Why at this solemn pomp of sacrifice,</l>
<l>Are all our country's nobles here conven'd,</l>
<l>But to receive the lawful successor?</l>
<l>And shall not Cyrus, conscious of his birth,</l>
<l>Strip from a bold impostor his salse titles,</l>

<l>My friend,</l>
<l>Where is Astyages?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARPAGUS</speaker>
<l>But now arriv'd:</l>
<l>I left him in his tent in gloomy silence,</l>
<l>As if revolving in his mind the end</l>
<l>Of this day's sacrifice. He sends me hither</l>
<l>To learn if Cyrus yet approach the borders</l>
<l>And what the train he brings.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>Believ'st thou then</l>
<l>He means, indeed, to answer Media's hopes,</l>
<l>And give the realm a successor in Cyrus?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="21"/>
<speaker>HARPAGUS.</speaker>
<l>Trust me, Mithranes, never.—If sometimes</l>
<l>He feigns a momentary joy, or speaks</l>
<l>With seeming fondness of the approach of Cyrus,</l>
<l>Methinks thro' all the dark disguise appears</l>
<l>Some cruel purpose brooding in his soul.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>Thanks to the pow'r that thus provides a victim</l>
<l>To frustrate ev'ry ill that thence might threaten</l>
<l>The safety of the prince: this bold impostor,</l>
<l>Who wears his name, shall with his name inherit</l>
<l>Each evil that's design'd him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARPAGUS.</speaker>
<l>Nor does Media</l>
<l>Owe less her thanks to heav'n, that gave Mithranes</l>
<l>To rear her prince to every future greatness,</l>
<l>In virtue's safest school, an humble station,</l>
<l>Far from the splendid vices of a court,</l>
<l>Where golden luxury, and silken sloth,</l>
<l>Enervate our unhappy sons.—But say,</l>
<l>Hast thou to Cyrus yet reveal'd his birth?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>I have.</l>

<l>And how did he receive the tidings?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>Amaz'd at first he heard the important truth;</l>
<l>But when convinc'd—O had you then beheld</l>
<l>His generous ardour;—scarce cou'd I prevent</l>
<l>His filial love from seeking out Mandane,</l>
<l>And throwing at her feet a darling son.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="22"/>
<speaker>HARPAGUS.</speaker>
<l>Of that we must beware.—The weighty secret</l>
<l>Of his concealment must not be entrusted</l>
<l>To a fond mother's transports: not Cambyses</l>
<l>Knows yet this mystery of fate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>'Tis strange</l>
<l>Cambyses comes not yet.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Doubt not, Mithranes,</l>
<l>Cambyses will be present 'ere the hour</l>
<l>Fix'd for the sacrifice; perhaps ev'n now</l>
<l>He lurks disguis'd upon the neighbouring confines.</l>
<l>He must be wary; well thou know'st what danger</l>
<l>Awaits him, shou'd Astyages discover</l>
<l>His mandate disobey'd—but let us part,</l>

<l>WHAT hast thou said, Mithranes? Is Alcaeus</l>
<l>My son, my dearest Cyrus?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Peace, Mandane,</l>

<l>Where is now the danger?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>Danger is ev'ry where: when cruelty</l>
<l>Extends her iron reign, we ne'er can keep</l>
<l>Too strict a guard upon our speech: a dream</l>
<l>May rouze the slumbering fury: fell suspicion</l>
<l>On innocence will stamp the mark of guilt,</l>
<l>And tyranny assumes the mien of justice</l>

<l>'Tis true, 'tis true—O! I remember all—</l>

<l>Wou'd'st thou so long conceal him from my love?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MITHRANES.</speaker>
<l>I fear'd to trust maternal tenderness,</l>
<l>Which wisdom ill can rule; had not your sorrows</l>
<l>Awak'd my pity, had I not suspected</l>
<l>The worst from your revenge against Alcaeus,</l>
<l>To you your son had still remain'd unknown.</l>

<speaker>MANDANE.</speaker>
<l>And yet Mandane's wretched, envious fortune,</l>
<l>Spite of the sunshine that would gild the prospect,</l>
<l>Spreads o'er my day affliction's sable clouds.</l>
<l>Cyrus return'd and living must excite</l>
<l>A mother's dearest transports; but Cambyses</l>
<l>Return'd, and doom'd again to banishment,</l>
<l>Unseen, unwelcom'd, swells this heart with anguish.</l>

<l>Alas! my princess, calm your grief; let hope</l>
<l>Point you to future scenes of happiness:</l>

<l>By what strange means—declare each circumstance.</l>

<l>While with light steps he bounded o'er the turf;</l>
<l><pb n="51" facs="57"/>His auburn locks flow'd graceful down his back.</l>

<l>Does not the silence now of Harpagus,</l>
<l>Whose loyal truth is known, too well confirm it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANDANE.</speaker>
<l>O! 'tis too plain—Alcaeus is the assassin—</l>
<l>Hence his confusion in my sight—for this</l>
<l>He flew from my embraces, and tho' he came</l>
<l>With purpose to deceive a mother's fondness,</l>
<l>His soul shrunk back, all traitor as he was,</l>

<speaker>CYRUS.</speaker>
<l>Unhappy fair-one,</l>
<l>Look to the lovely mourner—thou, Mandane,</l>
<l>Wilt sooth her orphan sorrows.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CAMBYSES.</speaker>
<l>Droop not, son,</l>
<l>But rouze the latent hero; think from thee</l>
<l>What fate exacts; on thee what nations turn</l>
<l>Their long-desiring eyes.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CYRUS.</speaker>
<l>Alas, my father!</l>
<l>How shall I run this arduous race of glory?</l>
<l>Be present thou, and with maturer counsels</l>
<l>Support my erring youth: thou too, Mithranes,</l>
<l>Still guard that virtue which thy fostering care</l>
<l>First taught to bloom in life's sequester'd vale;</l>
<l>O! may it now thro' Asia's realms extend</l>
<l>The blessings of my sway, that every age</l>
<l>May learn to venerate the name of Cyrus!</l>

<byline>Written by a FRIEND.</byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. YATES.</byline>
<sp>
<l>WEll, here I am—thank heaven! no more Mandane—</l>
<l>Among ourselves this bard is but a Zany.</l>
<l>Says I—when first he offer'd me the part,</l>
<l>I hope'tis nature—levell'd at the heart!</l>
<l>Says he—a husband thought sar off to roam,</l>
<l>Disguis'd, and unexpectedly comes home.</l>
<l>A son returns, lost twenty years, dy'e see,</l>
<l>To call you mother, tho' not thirty-three.</l>
<l>This (I reply'd) will do, if I can guess,</l>
<l>For this indeed is natural distress—</l>
<l>Distress! (he cry'd) you quite mistake the thing;</l>
<l>Astyages you'll find—had dreamt—the king—</l>
<l>I stop'd him short—perhaps it may be true,</l>
<l>That your old nature differs from your new.</l>
<l>From various causes equal sorrows flow,</l>
<l>All realms and times have some peculiar woe:</l>
<l>With us what griefs from ills domestic rise,</l>
<l>When now a beau—and now a monkey dies!</l>
<l>In this our iron age, still harder lot,</l>
<l>A masquerade, no ticket to be got—</l>
<l>Your obsolete distress may now be told—</l>
<l>Let's see—there's ravishing—that's very old.</l>
<l>There's love that scorn'd a title and estate—</l>
<l>These woes of love are vastly ou? of date!</l>
<l>Then there's your martyr to his country's weal—</l>
<l>What strange distress these ancients us'd to seel!</l>
<l>The love of country now indeed runs high;</l>
<l>They prove its value most, who dearest buy;</l>
<l>Think what our patriots pay in sterling gold,</l>
<l>A single borough for seven years to hold.</l>
<l>Tho' here in <hi>statu quo</hi> I still remain,</l>
<l>I've oft been married, ravish'd, erown'd and slain!</l>
<l>None of all these have been my fate to-night,</l>
<l>So us'd to fancy'd anguish and delight;</l>
<l>Yet let me hope you felt the part I bore,</l>
<l>Give me your plaudit—we can wish no more.</l>
