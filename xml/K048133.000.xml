<p>ANY of our lads up here at the Toy since, Ned?</p>

<speaker>Wait.</speaker>
<p>Yes, your Honor; the crew of your cutter dined with us last Sunday.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Is old Alibi the attorney down here much?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wait.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir; he's over at his house.</p>

<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Have you seen his ward, Miss Sophia Seymour, lately?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wait.</speaker>
<p>Ah! poor young lady! he seldom let's her go out but to church—A charity for some gentleman, like your Honor, to whip off to church with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Why, Ned, I have some notion—but to give you a simile in your own way—the old black
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
rascal keeps her as close as a cork in a bottle; which, to get out, I mustn't bolt inward, but turn screw round and round, and then cluck's the word. Get me a room and put my things in it.</p>

<p>How shall I get to see her? My new rival too! Who can he be?—Let's see—Where did Sophia say she first saw him? <stage>(peruses a letter.)</stage> Noticed his watching me at the gate of Sir Ashton Lever's Museum—heavy shower at Chelsea—brought guardian and I to town in his hackney-coach—A monstrous fool!—Yes; but if this monstrous fool shou'd prove an over-match for all my wit—If I cou'd only contrive to see her.</p>

<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Aircourt! Who'd have thought of meeting you here at Hampton-Court?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Why, but what the deuce brought you here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>I'm here upon a love-scheme—incog.—hush! you remember I told you over the last bottle we crack'd together at the Bedford—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>True; our candles went out, and your story set me asleep <stage>(yawns.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Well, rouse now—You know Alibi the attorney—he's guardian to the most lovely—the sweetest—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Zounds, my Sophia!</p>
<stage>(aside.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>I'll have her,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Will you, faith? <stage>(aside.)</stage> What, then, you're acquainted with her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>The first time I saw my charmer, she was engaged in a wrangle with her guardian at the gate of the—Museum—in—a—Leicester-fields.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Leicester-fields! Oh, ho! <stage>(aside.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>She would see the butterflies, ha, ha, ha! He in a rage slapping his cane on a show-glass of watch-strings, seals, and sleeve-buttons—cries, "Zounds, it's half-a-crown"—The exact price of that pane, says the man of the shop—"Jack, fetch the glazier"—The expence of this accident determined the affair; and the generous attorney, instead of Sir Ashton's, proposing a trudge to Don Saltero's, I whip'd in a hack before them to Chelsea—Returning home, down comes an auspicious shower, and, to save eighteen-pence, Alibi accepts of part of my coach.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>What, your own hack, Ha, ha, ha!—Yes, this is Sophia's monstrous fool <stage>(aside).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>I throw a tender glance—Sophia blushes, and we exchange hearts through our eyes—Such ogles!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Damn your ogles! <stage>(surly.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>What!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>That is, I want to know your scheme.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Will you help?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>With pleasure—to cut your throat <stage>(aside).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Vastly good! That letter <stage>(gives it).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>To Capias Alibi, Esquire—Dear Sir, the bearer is a young man from Yorkshire, being desirous to improve himself in the profession of an attorney, I recommend him to you; and think a dealing in this case will be to the advantage of both. Yours, Nol Pross,—Well, what of this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="6"/>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Can't you see? <hi>That,</hi> I procured for a little cash, of a brother rogue of Alibi's—I deliver it—it gains me free access to Sophia; of which, if I don't avail myself—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Must turn him off from this <stage>(aside).</stage> Won't Alibi remember you in the Chelsea shower? Ha, ha, ha! won't he?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>No, he won't; ha, ha, ha! <stage>(mimicking.)</stage> For, to get the worth of his money in gaping about, he scarce look'd at me at Don Saltero's—And then, to face my charming Sophia, I sat beside him in the coach; besides, I shall change my voice; and, to provide for that, I've made Nol say I am from Yorkshire—Oh, you'd laugh to see—I shall be clerkified all over <stage>(displays his dress)</stage>.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>But really now, do you think old Alibi is such a blockhead as not to perceive from your air, person, address—the fashion that is in your manner altogether! What! take you for a sordid, shabby Cursitor-street ramskin scribbler? Ha, ha, ha! never! The gentleman in your coat wou'd belie Nol Pross's letter, and get you and it kicked out of the house, to the eternal disgrace of St. James's, and the triumph of Chancery-lane.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Egad, Aircourt, I believe you're right.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Depend upon't, the old attorney wou'd perceive the diamond, though set in copper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Hang it! this air of travel which we acquire abroad—I wish I wasn't so—elegant in my manière—I wish I had a little of the common—vulgar—Now you, Aircourt, how natural you'd look the ramskin scribbler!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>D'ye think so? you flatter me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>O, you'd top the character!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Then, dem'me, I'll appear in it. I will secure this letter—that will do—and for change of
<pb n="7" facs="7"/>
dress, Ned the Waiter will equip me! <stage>(aside.)</stage> Zounds, it is two o'clock! but I can get to Drurylane by the second act.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>'Sdeath! don't think of town or playhouses to-night!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Her Calista is one of the most capital—When she tears the letter—To atoms thus let me tear the wicked, lying evidence of shame— <stage><hi>(having, unseen, put</hi> LARRY's letter in his pocket, tears another).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Why, zounds, you've torn my letter!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>And then her smile of contempt upon Horatio, after—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Damn you and Horatio, Sir! D'ye see what you've done? Knock'd up my whole affair!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>'Pon my soul I ask pardon—I did not think what I was about.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>The devil! What am I to do now? This is cruel of you, Aircourt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Come, O'Donovan, though I've destroyed your passport, no harm done. For any project to gain Sophia, I'm yours—from a spank to Scotland, burning old Alibi's house, or any mischief of that sort.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>My dear Aircourt, I thank you heartily—I'll go dress, and then for Lady Arable's, a charming young widow here at Hampton Court—Has been over in Ireland to view some of her estates there, and my father has squir'd her back again—Designs her as a match for me—Ha, ha, ha!. Rather a nice thing to match me, Eh, Aircourt?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Yes; but I think I'll match you, ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>My father don't know I have been five months diverting myself in England under an assumed name—Dad thinks I'm still on my Italian
<pb n="8" facs="8"/>
travels—my bills will come pelting in upon him rarely—An't I right, my boy? Lovely Sophia!—Love, fire, and frolick, that's my motto!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Plague of your frolicks! <stage>(aside.)</stage>—Sophia, perhaps, is at home now?—That is—he keeps her close.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Close! she saves him the expence of a clerk. But, Aircourt, don't think of London tonight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Well, I won't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry</speaker>
<stage>(looking at fragments).</stage>
<p>Honest Nol Pross's letter—What the devil's to be done?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Nol Pross's letter <stage>(looking at it)</stage>; it will do something yet, ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>I will not write any more of his law-gibberish! Was ever poor girl so used as I am by this wicked old attorney!

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>Lord, Sir! Do you go out to quarrel with the people only on purpose that they may beat you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>To be sure! Beat! Why, I have made 50 <hi>l.</hi> out of the wag of a finger, and have earned a hundred guineas of a morning, only by single tweaks by the nose.—Now, Miss, have you drawn up the bill of indictment? Egad! child, you'll have no use for your fortune! By the Lord! you'll make a choice chamber counsel.— <stage>(Reads)</stage> Parish aforesaid—county aforesaid—did make an assault upon one—and did then and there beat, wound, and cruelly illtreat—against the peace of our sovereign lord the king—But of all the fine wrestlers that dance on the green, young Harry's the lad for me!—Oh, the devil! here's a bill of indictment to come before a grand jury!—So, the exciseman breaks my head with his gauging stick, and then Young Harry's the lad for me!</p>

<p>Well; and so Harry Aircourt is the lad for me, in spite of you or all Westminster-hall, with Lord Chief Justice at your head.</p>

<p>I wish I could but once see this fine Mr. Harry Aircourt in the street though, only to see if he's such a prime serjeant as you make him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>He a prime serjeant! No! heaven made my Aircourt handsome, witty, gay, elegant, generous, and good natur'd.</p>

<p>It's his good nature that shoves him on to make ballads about me, and set all his drunken companions at the Anacreontic roaring out in

<p>Why, Sophy, you're the most conceited—When, neither you nor I ever saw this young man before.

You are welcome, my lad, and so is your money! <stage>(takes it.)</stage></p>

<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Never mind, young man? I don't want any refreshment—I've set Lady Arable down at her house, and am only walking about to see your town and palace. And, Joy, so this is your coffee-room? Oh, newspapers! Let's peep at the Lie of the Day <stage>(reads)</stage>.</p>

<stage><hi>Exit</hi> WAITER.</stage>
<p>I ask pardon, Sir—whence are you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I came from London now, and got there only last night from Ireland.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Then you're Irish?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I have that honor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>And pray, my young traveller—excuse my questions; but I feel myself interested in your concerns, though a stranger to them. Tell me, what are your views?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>In my infancy, my father, Sir, (I never knew the cause,) came over to England, and thus destitute, Providence raised a friend, who placed me at Dublin College. The death of this benefactor stopping my resources, obliged me to quit my studies, and I have been drawn to Hampton-Court on the credit of a disjointed kind of story, that my father had retired here in the enjoyment of an ample fortune, which he had acquired by the practice of an attorney: but after a long journey, and every possible inquiry, I can hear of no such person.</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Povot! bring a glass—Such an abominable room to dress in! For a glass you thought, I suppose, Narcissus-like, I was to set my face in a bason of water.</p>

<p>Hah! this is something! <stage>(adjusts himself before a glass.)</stage> There you are, from toupee to shoe—string—As this lady's house is so near—Povot, another volley from your powder-puff.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Why, you scoundrel! what, do you mean to make a barber's shop of a coffee-room?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>A little more on this curl, Povot.</p>

<p><stage><hi>(looks after</hi> LARRY, <hi>then at</hi> O'DONOVAN).</stage> Oh, what a bitter mistake has fortune made! Now that thing, void of manners and humanity, may have a worthy father, who, while he supplies with a liberal hand, little thinks he's throwing his money away upon a rascal! Ah, this is your <hi>home</hi>-education! I have a son abroad that I expect in a few days, stay till you see him, my generous lad—he shall thank you for your spirited politeness to me.—Since you have lost your friend, and can't find your father, inquire for me at Lady Arable's—Something may be done—Hold!—I'll perform first, and that saves the trouble of a promise, and precludes even a chance of disappointment <stage>(offers money)</stage>.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>Sir Carrol O'Donovan! Then the son that he speaks of must be the child my mother nursed—Now I shall know if she's yet living.—But alienated by her neglect, as I never knew the tender care of a parent, I don't feel that impulse of filial affection—Sir Carrol shan't know who I am—The meanness of my birth might add contempt to the compassion that my poverty has already excited.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Well, Lady Arable, recollect that your wise, old, and very good friends advised you to put yourself and fortune under the protection of an husband—I am entirely of their opinion; besides wasting the charming bloom of life in lonely widowhood, your property requires an hearted solicitude to manage it—If on sight (as you promised your relations) you shou'd like my son well enough to bless him with your fair hand—Oh, you will make me happy!

<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Eh! that's one way of coming out.</p>

<p>The Yorkshire way; whenever we'd come out of a room, we always go in first. V</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Your hand, you'll make a damned good lawyer! But I left you in that room, and I locked the door.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aire,</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, but you didn't lock the window!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="26" facs="26"/>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>He'll do. A queer beginning though! no doing without application, my friend! I set you about an affair of consequence within <hi>there,</hi> and I find you with my ward without <hi>here.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>O, my poor guardian! so when you thought you had Robin in crib, here was he teaching me to play cribbage—He, he, he!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>How dare you quit your station?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, I thought it was dinner-time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>No danger from this fellow—I never heard or read of a lover that was hungry <stage>(aside)</stage>.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I'd have you take care of one Aircourt, her head runs on nothing but him—he'll certainly carry her off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>Oh, that nothing may hinder him!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but <hi>something</hi> shall hinder him—my wit, my vigilance shall.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>But what's your wit to a young fellow with strength in his arm and the devil in his head?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean—to talk, so, boy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>Guardian! in spite of all your art and cunning, if my Aircouit, inspired by love and superior wit, had by an ingenuity of stratagem got in here, what would you do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Aye, Sir, what would you do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>Cou'dn't he push a little feeble old quizby like you down into a—chair?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>How, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>Shew him how, Robin.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Why, there <stage>(shoves him into a chair.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Well, now what would he do then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Why he'd carry the girl off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>If these are your notions, your friends did well to have you "larn the laa" if only to save you from being hanged some time or other! A good occasion this to give him his first lesson <stage>(aside).</stage>—
<pb n="27" facs="27"/>
Well, honest Robin, you suppose it a very easy pleasant thing for a young fellow to run away with a lady from her guardian?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Quite easy, and vastly pleasant mayhap.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Then I'll shew you, how for such a pleasant trick, you may hop and dance too. Sophy, hand me down that Coke yonder.</p>

<p>Stop, Miss, I'm taller nor yow <stage>(helping her the book falls)</stage>.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Why, you dog, do you want to kill the girl?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>Yes, he's quite a killing creature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Now, my boy, I've something here under my thumb, that will open your eyes to the danger of breaking the laws of your country!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>But a true lover despises law and danger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Despise law! that's a decent word out of your mouth, Miss, before my pupil <stage>(apart).</stage>—Now, Robin, for argument's sake, we'll suppose that this young lady has 30,000/.—I don't say she has, only putting a cafe—and here I am her guardian; and we'll say, still for argument's sake, you are Aircourt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>Aye, you are <hi>my</hi> Aircourt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>And you <hi>my</hi> Sophia; and there sits your gentle old quizby with Lord Coke under his thumb.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Now, Robin—I beg your pardon, Mr. Aircourt—only just take that lady out of that door, and if you can read I'll after that shew you a few lines here that will convince you what a hopeful hobble one of us will be in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>But let's understand—Oh! I'm to make believe to run away with her, and we're to leave you in a hobble.</p>

<p>Me go out with him! Silly! indeed I shan't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Why, you perverse girl! mustn't I give the lad some insight of the profession since I've touched his money? and no conviction like example—do it <stage>(apart).</stage> Take Sophy away.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>I woll, I woll. But, Sir, if Aircourt even had carried off Miss in the manner I'm going to do, nobody would believe it—its so comical—he, he, he!—They'd only think it the "Lie of the Day."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Aye, Robin! the "Lie of the Day!"—There, go.</p>

<p>Eloped! but with who, and what, and how?</p>

<p>Dear Lady Arable, how can such a thing come into your head?</p>

<p>No!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Aye, a second-hand wife. You're a fine fellow O'Donovan, and should have a new one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>I will—I'll make formal proposals for Sophia. I had the sweetest smile from her window just now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Gone home? <stage>(aside.)</stage> Was ever such a little twirlabout tee-to-tum.</p>
</sp>

<p>I have sent my man to Alibi's to request an interview—but, Aircourt, you told me <hi>you</hi> were on a love scheme here? What are you about with your girl?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>I have, and a damned troublesome puppy he is—just as you intend to Sophia, I am told he
<pb n="32" facs="32"/>
designs to make proposals for my mistress to her guardian.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>But what objection has this guardian to you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Why, I don't know: some busy body has been chattering that I wrote a song upon him, or I intended to have him caricatured in the printshops; the thing above all others it seems he's most afraid of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Gad! I have it—Send an anonymous line to the guardian, that a most notorious hummer has laid a plan to come as a suitor to his ward, but his real purpose to get his person and manner for a caricature print or song to turn him into ridicule; and if he is such an unique he'll take the alarm at once—I warrant your rival trundled out of the house without a hearing, ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>And so, O'Donovan, this is your comfortable advice?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>I only wish I had a rival with my Sophia that I might put the joke in practice. What a cursed foolish figure he'd cut!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>You really think he would?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Oh, by Heaven! it would be the highest—only do try it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Well, perhaps I may—You've sent your man you say to Alibi?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and in three minutes time I shall be there myself and make proposals. But never mind me, Aircourt; do send the letter to your old lad; you may sign yourself <hi>"unknown friend"</hi> or <hi>"Q. in the corner"</hi>—ha, ha, ha! 'twill make a screeching laugh.</p>

<p>PERFIDIOUS Katty!

But Sir Carrol seems so bent upon his son's marrying her—How to ward that! If I discover to Sir Carrol that Larry's not his son—But Katty told me that under the seal of secresy—Honor—honor—honor! As I'm sure of my Lady's heart, what if I start this young stranger at her—Sir Carrol perceives it; his proud Irish blood is up, and he commands his son to think no more of her. In steps I, and all's my own. Oh, the beagle! Hip, boy, holloa!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>Lord, my guardian has got a new wife—She let me escape—I told her I knew where there was real genuine Irish snuff to be sold, and that I'd go and buy her some—But, dear, it wou'd be very wicked in me to set the poor old soul sneezing, he, he, he!—Lady Arable, I came to ask about Aircourt—I suppose you think me very forward?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Ara.</speaker>
<p>We must be blameless ourselves before we censure others—But, Sophia, you found I was wrong; that your Aircourt and Mr. O'Donovan are distinct persons.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes; oh, such a trick as Aircourt served him, ha, ha! But yet I fear my lover, from thinking himself sure of my heart, will grow careless—If I cou'd but make him jealous—He despises his present rival too much for that—Lord, Lady Arable, if that handsome young man you've here would walk before my windows, sighing and kissing his handkerchief, it wou'd be such a spur to Aircourt—Oh, he'd whip me off to Gretna Green at once.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Ara.</speaker>
<p>But, Sophia, what if that handsome young man should not be quite indifferent to me.</p>

<p>You're in love with him; I see it in your face—Lord, never mind his being poor—have him, and we'll all four run away together.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Ara.</speaker>
<p>Though I flatter myself he's touch'd with mutual tenderness, yet the disparity of our situation can't suffer him to disclose it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>O the fate of us poor women! We must walk round about the dear object, and, like a troubled ghost, never speak till we're spoken to; whilst the men can spout away—Oh, never, my most adorable creature!—"I die for you!"—"My angel!"—"I languish!"—!"Pon my honor!"—" My love!"—"Oh! oh!" <stage>(mimicks.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Ara.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! As you say, Sophia, it never can come from me, therefore we must both pine in thought.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>It <hi>shall</hi> come from you though; you're a friend to my love, and I'll be a friend to yours, he, he, he!—Lady Arable, since you're out of all hope with this young man, tell him I have a penchant for him—it will make Aircourt so jealous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Ara.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sophia, I will—It may at least be a trial how his heart is really affected towards myself.</p>

<speaker>Lady Ara.</speaker>
<p>Well, well.—I'm entrusted, Sir, with a strange kind of commission—You'll not be very surprized; for these things are more common than they should be—There is a certain lady who, if your heart is quite disengaged, is inclin'd to entertain some ideas in your favour.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p><stage>(opens it indifferently.)</stage> How! <stage>(surprized.)</stage> Impossible! Oh, Lady Arable! my heart, while I confess it sensibly awake to each perfection, never harboured a thought of the divine original <stage>(kisses it).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Ara.</speaker>
<p>Then he knows Sophia! Her money must have been his first attraction, and doubtless brought him to this neighbourhood—Divine! <stage>(walks angry.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>She's offended—First try, and then punish my presumption! Cruel of you, Madam, to betray me into a confession that before I could make, I'd have perish'd—Pardon my audacity—I return you your picture, and relinquish every hope—I can never shew my face again—to you—or my benefactor—Heaven protect—my heart is full! Adieu, most honored Lady!</p>

<head>SCENE—<stage><hi>As before.</hi></stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> O'DONOVAN.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>How unlucky this mischievous fool Metheglin to acquaint Sir Carrol of my passion for Lady Arable; hers for me I have proved was entirely his own fancy. My benefactor must think me presumptuous and ungrateful. No; I'll return no more—This lawyer may afford me at least a temporary employment—if not I'll directly for London. Sir Carrol seems disturbed— <stage>(retires).</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Sir CARROL.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>May I believe Metheglin's story—this young Larry as he calls him, whom I considered my son, really Alibi's!—Would they graft their
<pb n="50" facs="50"/>
rascally bramble on the noble stock of the O'Donovans! Then, my poor unhappy child, whoever he is, must go by their name—Lawrence Kavanagh! Perhaps they have abandoned him, and, he now languishes in penury—perhaps—dead!</p>
<stage>O'DONOVAN <hi>advances.</hi></stage>
<p>Ha! my lad, we were all surprized at your abrupt departure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>Sir Carrol, though I confess myself unworthy of your bounty, I'm not yet so base as to accept obligations from the person I have injured.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Why. Metheglin has been telling us—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>Truth! By insidiously cherishing a passion for your son's intended lady, I fear I have frustrated your favourite wish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>So a point of gratitude impelled him to relirquish the affluence that probably offered a reward to his merit—A noble-minded youth <stage>(aside).</stage>—How you first became acquainted with Lady Arable I do not ask; but had she been more candid, you should not have been hurt, nor her Ladyship troubled by my proposals for my son. The opinion I conceived of you at first sight has not deceived me. You have interested me to a more particular inquiry; and first tell me what is your name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>Kavanagh.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>How! your Christian name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>Lawrence!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Who are your parents? <stage>(quick and with great emotion)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I have just now seen my mother in, this house. but I think she did not know me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>She nursed my son!</p>

<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<stage>(bows.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="51" facs="51"/>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>It is—my Edward!—my generous boy! <stage>(embraces him)</stage>—so long the forlorn child of indigence—alike an unhappy subject for the scorn of pride and the tear of pity <stage>(puts his handkerchief to his eyes).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>Can this be?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p><stage>(without).</stage> No, wife, you shan't prevail upon me to connive at your imposition.</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ALIBI.</stage>
<p>Since Katty has squeaked, I'll slip my own neck out of the noose <stage>(aside).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Well, Mr. Alibi, alias Kavanagh! <stage>(ALIBI surprized)</stage> I left you in Ireland twenty years ago a profligate young man, and now I find you in England a hardened old knave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>In youth, when the passions take the rein, vice may be the effect of folly; but when judgment is matur'd by age, a vicious man is a confirmed soundrel! Where's my son, rascal?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<stage>(trembling).</stage>
<p>Indeed, Sir Carrol, I'd myself give a thousand pounds to find him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Look, honor—and ask his pardon.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Lady ARABLE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Don.</speaker>
<p>Merciful heaven! I came hither to seek—but to find such a father! <stage>(kneels)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Rise, my dear son; I'm not more rejoiced at finding you, than by fortune's knocking at the door of poverty to see it opened by an honest man.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="52" facs="52"/><hi>Enter</hi> METHEGLIN.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Ara.</speaker>
<p>This gentleman your son, Sir Carrol! This I hope may in some measure justify what I dreaded would prove the inexcusabl error of my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Meth.</speaker>
<p>Your choice of me, error, my Lady! <stage>(All stare)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Mr. Metheglin, I fear you've been in a litte mistake here; but as it has discovered your perfidious Katty and her husband's imposture upon me, you shan't lose your place at the sideboard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Meth.</speaker>
<p>Sideboard! My wedding suit, new white gloves and brigadier wig!—Ah, you'll be yet Sir Edward! Title turns it—Oh, woman! sacrifice happiness to vanity!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> LARRY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my haughty goddess! your consent comes now too late—Upon my honor you cannot have me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Meth.</speaker>
<p>Well said, Larry!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Larry!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Thank Heaven you are no son of mine! There is your father! <stage><hi>(pointing to</hi> ALIBI.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Sir Carrol's right. This is his young gentleman, and you are mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Meth.</speaker>
<p>How do you do, Larry?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>Larry! what the devil do you Larry me for?—Your son! Eh?—Old Alibi's son! <stage>(Noise without.)</stage>—What is the meaning of all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ailibi.</speaker>
<p>The Captain again! Hide that bottle and lock the china cupboard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="53" facs="53"/>
<speaker>Meth.</speaker>
<p>Give me the bottle and lock us up together.</p>
<stage>Retires.</stage>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> AIRCOURT <hi>and</hi> SOPHIA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Be it known from Belgrade to Balbriggin that old gentlemen may keep their widows! for this lady is now the wife of Captain Kilmeinham O'Squramough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Your wife! And who are you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Alibi; I supposed from the known venality of your character, had I asked your consent fairly and openly, I never should have gained it; but instead of a needy adventurer, my Sophia shall prove, that to obtain her charming self was the sole object of her affectionate Aircourt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry</speaker>
<p>No my dear fellow, you took her off for me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>No, my dear fellow, I took her off for myself!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Larry.</speaker>
<p>But you said for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Pho! 'twas only the "Lie of the Day!"—With any other motive I'd scorn to circumvent a friend; but in love all stratagem is allowable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Meth</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! how do you do, Larry?</p>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>This Aircourt!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Airc.</speaker>
<p>Aye, poor clerk Robin! who used to play with the maids!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Mind, her fortune is still in my hands—I'm her guardian!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, you are not. The name for executor in my mother's will is Alibi; now, as I understand that yours is Kavanagh, we shall make your part in the trust void by the misnomer!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="54" facs="54" ana="y"/>
<speaker>Alibi.</speaker>
<p>Here's petticoat pleading! I must make her a chamber council, and be curst to me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
<p>He, he, he! How did you like my picture, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Ara.</speaker>
<p>Ah, you arch one!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Car.</speaker>
<p>Reimburse the four thousand it has cost me in the training of your son Lawrence! and give this lady her fortune; or for your fraud on me I'll prosecute you to beggary! To acquire riches was the cause of your crime; the loss of them now be your punishment—The events of this day have proved, that the Eye which sees all, directs an unerring hand, to give vice the lash, and drop on the brow of honour the blooming wreath of unfading happiness.</p>
