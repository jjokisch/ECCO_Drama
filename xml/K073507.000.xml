<p>What a wretched system of government do we live under?—That accursed LIBERTY! which ought to be enjoyed only by the Great, has been, by the d—d troublesome plebeian scoundrels, who founded in freedom the basis of this hateful Constitution, so clearly transmitted down to their posterity, that ev'n with the most u— and c— K— that ever lived, and no want of M—l tools ready enough to support every step to despotism!—Yet, one d— obstinate fellow has had address enough, in spite of persecution, to keep the peoples eyes open! and from my very first appearance on the Theatre of Politics to counteract every plot I can form!—Ha! but here comes <hi>Grapnel</hi>— <stage>(enter Grap.)</stage> Your G—s most obedient! I rejoice to see you!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRAP.</speaker>
<p>My Lord!—I'm yours entirely!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>Well! Good <hi>Grapnel,</hi>—how is it? does the madness of people begin to abate? or do they continue as restless and desperate as ever?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRAP.</speaker>
<p>Why,—'faith, my Lord, they go on to your wish; and their numbers rather increase than diminish!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>So much the better!—Military force! the very soul of Government! is so fettered in this d—d land of freedom, that there's no such thing as using it, until the terror of every cowardly peace officer obliges them to cry for it, and then we can employ it with some degree of plausibility!—
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
<hi>Grapnel,</hi> I have contriv'd it so, that none but sneaking fools shall, on that occasion, appear in opposition to the <hi>Watcherites!</hi> By which means the mobility may be induced to proceed to such enormities, that the blockheads who are to deal with them, will, to protect themselves, call loudly for military aid! and thereby furnish us with an excellent pretext to govern by that Power!—This, my Lord, is a crisis which demands all our attention:—your G—e must be at hand to support our schemes in C—l! for you know there is some difficulty there!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRAP.</speaker>
<p>Upon my honour, your Lordship must dispense with my attendance at this so critical a juncture!—My name and interest are always at your disposal:—But—my favourite pleasures! My Lord! I would not renounce—to please the K— of heav'n! far less any k— on earth!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>Good God! how much does your G—e surprise me? just at the most important juncture of all our hopes and fears, to see a nobleman of your abilities careless of so great concerns—is, indeed, amazing!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRAP.</speaker>
<p>My Lord! it does not signify—with me, business must yield to pleasure!—in this hour, I sacrifice more to your Lordship alone!—than I would—to save a nation from perdition!—Think only my darling Flavia is in impatient waiting—the post-chaise has been ready these two hours—and—let us drive as fast as we can—we shall lose, at least, the first course of sport!—So—My good Lord, excuse me—I am yours— <stage>(offering to go.)</stage></p>

<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>But—My Lord—one moment!—</p>

<p>Never was there so unhappy a favourite as I am! with all that well known influence I have gain'd over every thing stampt with R—y, from the indolence of an artless C—n, down to the cunning of the more active petticoat!—yet those of the nobility, who have understanding to be of any service in arbitrary projects, are either so timid and fearful of popular clamour, or so prone to dissipation and pleasure—that I am drove to the disagreeable necessity of availing myself of others, who have too much to be done by one man—whose chief study is—to make the world believe—he does nothing!—Ha! some fresh reproach—I hear <hi>Almagnia.</hi></p>

<sp>
<speaker>ALM.</speaker>
<p>My Lord! 'tis past all bearing!—was ever a person in my exalted station, suffered to be so daringly and openly insulted, by a rabble of—rascally slaves!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>Alas! Madam! they are not slaves!—that's what I want to bring 'em to!—May I but accomplish that,—your vengeance should be amply gratified.—But what's the matter—tell me thou dear empress of my heart—does any thing new distress you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALM.</speaker>
<p>See here! another vile scrawl, found pasted near the p—e g—e this morning!—What! are all the guards blind? where are their eyes? what have they their arms and their pay for? I conjure you, my Lord, to enquire into this matter; find out who were upon guard;—I shall insist that they be punished—I never desire to see any but the —d regiment mount upon the —</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>Madam—that's what cannot be—such distinctions would provoke our best friends, the a—y, to the same disaffection which governs the multitude—and then indeed, the event might be fatal to both you and me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALM.</speaker>
<p>Well—well, my Lord!—if a—must submit to such rudeness—better be the m— of a shoe black—than the m— of a—! the one may sue for redress—I, it seems cannot!— <stage>(she cries, and indignantly throws a paper to him)—he takes it up and reads:</stage>—"The <gap resp="author" extent="1 word" reason="blank"/> is a fool!—his <gap resp="author" extent="1 word" reason="blank"/> a whore!—Botch is a rogue!—We need say no more!"—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>Such insolence is indeed distracting!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALM.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my Lord—such insolence is distracting—and to suffer it—not much to the honour of a man, for whom I have so dearly purchased so much power—By heav'ns, 'tis want of spirit!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>Madam!—you wrong me.—What man dare do—I dare—But the constitution of this d—d country, so little understood by either you or me, is so pregnant with obstacles to arbitrary g—t —That while one <hi>Watcher</hi> stands in our way, the difficulties are almost insuperable!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALM.</speaker>
<p>Very fine indeed!—After having spent the very best of my youth to aggrandize, and to make you happy—I must at length be told, that the ac—d c—n of this country condemns me to bear hourly insults unnoticed, and confinement from every sort of pleasure; but—those of my bed chamber!—Of what importance then, my Lord, has been the persecution and imprisonment of the so much dreaded <hi>Watcher?</hi>—Had it not been better to have purchased him also! at any price?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>Madam! you know as little of <hi>Watcher</hi> as you do of the E— c—n!—he is incorruptible!—For what good purpose, do you think it was that I bestowed so much pains to soften and reclaim the most obdurate enemy we had!—The so popular <hi>Chatwell!</hi>—Why, madam!—all that was with a view to trapan <hi>Watcher!—Chatwell</hi> had his price!—I found it out—I left him and his contentious ally, Lord <hi>Taunter,</hi> to divide the nations spoils between 'em—and—all to silence this d—d <hi>Watcher!</hi> whom I thought was so inviolably attached to their interests, that he would lead just as they pleased!—but he's an unfathomable fellow!—The PEOPLE are his K—!—and HE is THEIRS!—there's no separating their interests!—Nor do I see a possibility of purchasing <hi>Watcher</hi>'s services.—But at—a price—which no m—r will ever part with:—that is—to yield up all the power and wealth of c—t supporters and c—t p—rs, to be divided amongst the multitude, that they forsooth may enjoy the conveniencies of life, with no less satisfaction, than the best of us!—perdition seize such Liberty!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALM.</speaker>
<p>Then, my Lord!—I find there's no hope left.—I wish I was any where, out of this vile country!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>A moment's patience, madam!—I have yet some cards to play:—for <hi>Chatwell</hi> and <hi>Taunter</hi> when they had, you know, the whole k—m at their disposal differed between themselves, as I rightly judged, about the dividing of it.—I threw them the bait on purpose;—they tug'd, and tug'd at each end of it; until <hi>Chatwell,</hi> finding, what every body had seen before, that the avidity of <hi>Taunter</hi> was insatiable; then invited others, less gormandizers, to partake of the feast!
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>
—and by one clever jirk, he pulled the bait entirely out of <hi>Taunter</hi>'s maw!—he next gilded a a pill for <hi>Prattle!—Prattle</hi> swallowed it!—and the edge of his patriotic zeal was blunted!—<hi>Watcher,</hi> perceiving that the capital pillars of his grand structure were thus shaken, and that <hi>Taunter</hi> only was left unsatisfied, bethought him next, to rear an edifice on a broader bottom, to be founded in greater solidity, and to require fewer ornaments.—He applies himself to the public—endeavours, as the most interested, to open their eyes; and, to speak truth, he has laboured so successfully, that the Question now is—Whether all must yield to WATCHER and LIBERTY!—or, by force and despotism, endeavour to <hi>chastise</hi> both!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALM.</speaker>
<p>And do you make a question of that?—have you not <hi>Watcher</hi> already tied up? Are not the j—s of our side? and have you not all the m—y force of the n—n at your command?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>True, madam! <hi>Watcher</hi> is confined, but this confinement is rather form than reality.—And if he was of that seditious spirit that we attribute to him, he has friends enough at his nod, to shake the pillars, not of his p—n only, but the p—e too.—And it is from some violent attempt of that sort, that my best hopes are at present founded.—But I fear he has too much penetration for us all;—for altho' he sustains the spirit of the multitude, he artfully restrains their impetuosity.—As for the j—s—I hope they lean to our side, but the sagacity of <hi>Mansupple</hi> is so guarded, that he'll do nothing rashly—the best services he will do for us, must have, at least, the countenance of l—.—The m—y are no doubt at our devotion; but even with respect to them, I am under some difficulties—there's Lord <hi>Shelter</hi> rides
<pb n="8" facs="11"/>
resty—he is yet too young in m—l practices—nay, I'm afraid the projects we must now carry through, are somewhat repugnant to his notions of politics.—I'm afraid he's either too honest, or too timorous—he feels too warmly for the people—and altho' he never was in the cabal with <hi>Watcher,</hi> yet he rather seems to disapprove of rigid measures—in one word. I am deceived in him—I do not like him—and yet when force is necessary, I would wish to have his sanction.—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter a <hi>SERVANT.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SERV.</speaker>
<p>My Lord—an officer—.</p>
<stage>[Ex. <hi>Almagnia.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<stage>Enter an <hi>OFFICER.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<p>My Lord—all is in an uproar—nothing to be heard from one end of the city to the other—but—WATCHER and LIBERTY—no liberty! no life!—down with BOTCH and all Botchers—The p—n is surrounded by thousands, and the fields are filled with millions!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>So much the better—But pray how does <hi>Watcher</hi> behave?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<p>Why, my Lord, he seldom appears; and when he does come to the window, the acclamations are so loud, that he can't be heard himself.—One of his d—d adherents told me, that in the midst of their uproar, a servant of <hi>Watcher</hi>'s mingled with the mob; they bore the servant on their shoulders.—Swore, that maugre all power on earth they would have him out. And that if he would not come to the window to satisfy them that he was well, and well-used—they would instantly knock down every thing before them, and make their way to his apartment.—The servant told them he would speak to them, and had twice
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>
attempted it, but that their clamour was so noisy, he could not be heard.—My Lord, it will surprise you, but 'tis true, the word of command for silence was given out, and in a trice all was as still as a bagnio at mid-day.—The servant returned. <hi>Watcher</hi> came to his window and harrangued the people, upon the impropriety of their assembling in such numbers neglecting their business, and their families, to do him more harm than good—told them, his confinement was by appointment of law, that the same law would soon relieve him; and that he would not for a kingdom enjoy one hour of freedom that was contrary to law.—He prayed them to dismiss—and promised that should any illegal steps be pursued to punish him, or injure them, he would then be glad of and call for their assistance, but at present he had no complaints.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>Curse his discretion!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFI.</speaker>
<p>But all would not do, my Lord—he had no sooner finished, and pulled down his window, than the shouting grew louder—his enemies were all d—d—and swearing that there could be neither law nor reason to punish so great a man; the outrage grew more violent—they insulted the senturies — and J— requires more force, otherwise, he says, he'll abandon his post.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>So far well—fly instantly and find Lord <hi>Barnacle.</hi>—</p>

<p>My good Lord—you're welcome—</p>

<p>My Lord—the uproar increases—Lord <hi>Wimple</hi> begs your lordship's opinion—Lord <hi>Shelter</hi> opposes sending any troops, or if any should be sent, he is for marching all the three regiments,
<pb n="10" facs="13"/>
that the people seeing no chance of opposition may disperse quietly.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>Why, my Lord—that would be to represent g— as too fearful, and the mob as too important.—My opinion is, that a small detachment should first be sent;—if they are resisted, let others be ready to reinforce them; and let the t—d r—t be kept under arms as a reserve, that, when the fury of the ruffians is thus gradually roused to a proper pitch, <hi>they</hi> may have a good pretence to fall upon them, and heartily revenge their country's affronts.—</p>

<head><hi>SCENE,</hi> <stage>a Garden.</stage></head>
<stage>Enter <hi>HONESTY</hi> and <hi>BLUNT.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>Why, friend <hi>Blunt</hi>—these are shameful and terrible doings.—See what all this patriotism of <hi>Watchers</hi> brings upon us?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p>Friend <hi>Honesty</hi> thou art certainly mad!—All this patriotism of <hi>Watchers!</hi>—What in the name of justice!—Do you blame <hi>Watcher?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>No, I do not blame <hi>Watcher</hi> as the actual transgressor, but as the original cause; for had he kept himself quiet, and given no countenance to the mob, perhaps his past offences might have been forgotten; the g—t might have overlookt him; then there would have been no canvassing, no caballing, nor no riots!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p>Friend <hi>Honesty</hi>—you are not yet well acquainted with the true spirit and character of <hi>Jack Watcher.</hi>—Some others of your more pusilanimous <hi>liberty boasters,</hi> would, as you say, have kissed the rod long before now.—But <hi>Jack</hi> is not that man—he has once fairly engaged to be <hi>liberty</hi>'s and the <hi>people</hi>'s champion.—And to expose to the just censure of the public, those m—l s—s, who would sacrifice both to the lust of their own temporary emolument—he has resolution, and he has honesty.—And should arbitrary measures so far prevail against him as to bring him even under sentence of death—Whilst the people will adhere to him, and until he obtains for them, the end of his noble pursuit; he would go to that death sooner than owe his life to m—l favour!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="18"/>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>Well! well! but to what end does he seduce the people to neglect their business; and to make all this rout and noise, so much to the prejudice of themselves and neglect of their families? I still say that he is indirectly the cause of this day's slaughter!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p><hi>Watcher</hi> does by no means either seduce or inflame them.—They are sensible that it is on account of his firm attachment to them, and to the just influence he has got amongst them, that the resentment of a—n so keenly persecutes him; they justly think, if they were to leave him to lie neglected in a prison, where he's confined for their sakes, it would be the height of ingratitude.—This leads numbers of them successively to shew their personal gratitude, by which they imagine they keep up his spirits—This is poison to his persecutors.—They make a parade of g—s, c—s, &amp;c.—Such parades always gather abundance of idlers; and the indifferent, and the interested mingling together, look like a concourse of people, and are howsoever quiet, branded with the name of mob!—The scheme of g—t is to deter every body from so much as looking at him.—In hopes, by procrastinating his trial as they do, from day to day, that the people will at length be tired out, and so desert him:—But to blame him with any fatal consequences, is just as reasonable as it would be to blame me.—If I sent out a ship to purchase wealth to the nation, and if by the mismanagement of the master or pilot, the ship should be lost—the loss of that ship's crew may, I say, be as justly imputed to me, as the murders of this day can be imputed to honest <hi>Jack Watcher.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>Well, <hi>Blunt,</hi> but what security have the people, or you in your minds; supposing that <hi>Watcher</hi> was to get the better of his enemies;
<pb n="16" facs="19"/>
what security have you, I say, that he would more than others before him, exert unchangeably all his masterly faculties for the public weal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p>Every earthly security that can be promised upon incorruptibility!—a clear head!—and an honest heart!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>Pray what mighty proofs has he given of being incorruptible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p>Proofs, in such a case cannot be positive, because corruption seldom admits of evidence.—But never was any case supported by so strong presumptive proof.—During his service in p—t, his vigilance and activity could not escape the notice of the m—s.—We all know that many, with not the half of his talents, were bought off at a very high price, and his continuing so long unplaced, and unpensioned, is a convincing testimony to me, that he was not to be purchased.—In the next place, when through him, such a wound was given to the <hi>native liberty of E</hi>—! can you suppose that any <hi>son of corruption</hi> would have, in defence of it, undergone ignominious trials, and suffered imprisonment, when doubtless he could have avoided both, by letting the stab which <hi>liberty</hi> had sustained, pass unnoticed! Would not the m—y, think you, have paid him a very high price; rather than have submitted to the disgrace he brought upon them, and their emissaries? and yet did he not, as advocate for the <hi>public,</hi> peril his freedom and fortune, rather than yield one inch of <hi>theirs?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>Why <hi>Blunt,</hi> these are strong presumptions, I confess; but how will you justify that clearness of head, and goodness of heart, you ascribe to him, when you consider the censure of p—t!—
<pb n="17" facs="20"/>
and the v—s of a j—, standing against him for sedition and impiety?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p>As for the seditious part of it, <hi>Honesty</hi> has too much good sense not to grant me, that the speeches put into the mouths of the best of k—s by wicked m—rs, have before <hi>Watcher's</hi> time been as freely handled, and not a word said about it.—As to the accusation of impiety—I am sorry he is liable to the imputation.—But I will no more admit that he was guilty of a publication in that case; than if you was to shew me a witty poem; however wild it might be, of which I should wish for a copy, and you should consent to let me take one, on condition that I would furnish you with two or three.—The perusal of free thoughts on religious subjects, is only dangerous to the morals of mankind when they fall into the hands of weak heads, incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong.—When they come into the hands of men of sense, they will be able to discover and expose their errors, and thereby do rather service than harm to the truth.—And as it is impossible to conceive that ever the piece in question was designed for the public eye, as I can't help thinking that a most absurd verdict which pronounced it to be a publication; and by that means subjected the <hi>undesigning copier</hi> to the punishment due to a criminal publisher.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word <hi>Blunt</hi>—thou mak'st no bad advocate for thy friend <hi>Jack Watcher.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p>My friend! d'ye call him?—'Faith he's too keen a fellow to be a friend to <hi>Blunt</hi>—any farther, than as being the friend of the <hi>public,</hi> he's every man's friend; and as such, he shall always have <hi>Blunt</hi>'s best wishes. Nay, neighbour! I'll fairly tell you, that I'm determined to stand by him at the peril of all I'm worth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="18" facs="21"/>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>Give me thy fist, <hi>Blunt!</hi>—for, by my soul, <hi>Honesty</hi> will go hand in hand with thee.—I'll tell thee <hi>Blunt</hi>—It is now no trifling question—I don't at present look upon it as a simple contention between <hi>Watcher</hi> and the m—y!—I consider it as war openly declared between <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>arbitrary Power!</hi>—At no juncture, have the people so unanimously and avowedly distinguished themselves in the cause of Freedom and Patriotism!—And if it should be in the power of prerogative and despotism to render their endeavours upon this occasion, ineffectual, then may every one of us be next employed to rivet his neighbour's chains!—Along then, friend <hi>Blunt,</hi> let's go to the Duke's Head, and quaff one sober bottle—to <hi>Liberty</hi>—to <hi>Watcher</hi>—and to every true friend of our good kind and free-constitution!—</p>

<p>Heyday! what the devil's the matter? get about my business!—I have been in quest of business all the evening, and can find none—Times are very hard! d—d hard indeed, Mr. <hi>Blunt!</hi>—Do! for charities sake, treat me with a single pint—and a little bit of—any thing.</p>
</sp>

<p>Why—you hungry jade you, why don't you get to work? You could, if you would, do well enough!—But you prefer idleness, whoring,

and starving, to industry, decency, and a comfortable living?</p>
<p>'On my soul, now, that's merry enough—What is <hi>Blunt</hi> turned reformer too?—I shall lose all my friends bye and bye.—There's my good friend <hi>Jack Watcher</hi> already cooped up for pretending to reform politicks, and his acquaintance <hi>Blunt,</hi> to follow his ambitious example, must next engage in a task, just as arduous!—a reformation of petticoats!—But to be serious, Mr. <hi>Blunt.</hi>—I own I'm idle—not because I love idleness; but, because I dare not think—whoring I abhor—tho' necessity obliges me sometimes to practice it—and when the few friends with whom I really can enjoy an hour, happen to be out o'the way; you would pity me, if you knew how distrest I am—I have (hungry, as I am) shun'd half a dozen opportunities this same evening, of feasting and carousing!—but to go amidst such debauchery and rioting, as yet my stomach rises against.</p>

<p>Why, <hi>Blunt,</hi> I'll be honest and tell you—Although I was actually faithful to <hi>Scratch</hi> while I lived at his expence, yet I never lik'd him—Where one does not like—they cannot give pleasure—he conceited himself the prettiest little fellow in the world—and expected to be courted by a thousand sort of amorous blandishments, that I could not force myself to divert him with—he grew also cool—mutual indifference ensued!—When my dear undoer came to town—I long'd to repeat the act of my ruin!—In fine, without the least anger, we parted just as decently as we met.</p>

<p>Dear <hi>Blunt!</hi> don't for love's sake, call it a profession; those who make a profession of it—have the power or art, which you will, to please every body alike!—That I can't do—I have too quick sensations, and too much honesty to be a whore—I should for all the world, make just such another whore, as your friend <hi>Jack Watcher</hi> would make a courtier—He would like very well to enjoy all the pleasures, luxury and gaiety of a court; but he has too much honesty to purchase them by flattery and dissimulation.</p>

<p>I'faith, friend <hi>Blunt,</hi> that little harangue of yours has had a better effect, and done more good in five minutes, than all the m—l force of the kingdom could have effected in a week.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p>Why, I'll tell thee <hi>Honesty.</hi>—I say nothing but what are in reality the sentiments of <hi>Watcher</hi> himself—In the beginning of his endeavours here—popular appearances were necessary for
<pb n="25" facs="28"/>
him, to supply the defections of those affected patriots who had formerly flattered him with their eternal protection.—He found, after he had risked all, and spent all, in pursuit of the very schemes they had concerted with him, that they had fallen off, and become so luke-warm, that unless he should be able to inspirit the public with a just sense of his and their own oppressions, he must fall a sacrifice to real merit—he therefore, did not at first discourage their cabals; but as no man is more anxious than he, to preserve order and harmony in the community, and knowing very well the dangerous effects of popular fury; he has laboured with as much zeal to moderate their resentments, as he nobly intends to employ for the redress of their grievances!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>But pray tell me, <hi>Blunt!</hi> have his lately so great and powerful friends actually abandoned him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p>Not entirely abandoned him,—that's what for their own sakes, at least for the sake of that popularity on which they would still fain plume themselves; they dare hardly do.—They continue I believe to contribute towards his expence—but for his noble and spirited measures, they leave him to struggle through them the best way he can.—They will not consent, I imagine, that he be too rigorously handled; but they will as little concur with him in bringing to justice those tools of A—n who have disgraced and plundered the nation, to aggrandize themselves, and to crush the efforts of true patriotism.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>By my soul—<hi>Blunt!</hi>—I always feared it would be so—And yet, who could have thought it?—Who, for example to have heard the patriotic declamations of an orator <hi>Chatwell,</hi> while a c—r!—could have believed, he would ever
<pb n="26" facs="29"/>
submit to that degenerated inactivity, in which they now rock him to sleep.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p><hi>Chatwell</hi>'s degeneracy does by no means surprize me, I have ever lookt upon him to be the vainest of all men!—his best hopes were, from the beginning, founded in the people's applause; that he courted; that he obtained; and he has made a good account of it.—The amazing success which crown'd his a—n, made him the idol of the people, who would not see how greedily he adorned himself with ornaments of which he often spoiled the real purchaser; no man in these days dared to contradict him, and he therefore assumed every glory to himself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>Why <hi>Blunt</hi>—all that's but too true—nor did I begrudge him at that time any honour the graspt at—I regarded him as the saviour of a sinking state, and thought the more honour he acquired, the more he should have it in his power to distribute justice.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p>Yes, justice!—what justice pray did he attain for the honest q—I forgot his name—but who from pure publick spiritedness—threw himself out of a thriving trading company—Plan'd the attempt upon <hi>S—l</hi>—spent every shilling he had industriously gained, that he might convince the M—y of his sincerity—assisted or at least directed, in the operations which conquered it,—came home big with the hopes of grateful acknowledgments from so patriotic an A—n.—These hopes, not founded on imagination only, but in written holograph assurances under the hand of the great patriot himself—and did not <hi>Chatwell</hi> nevertheless, not only assume to himself the whole merit of that scheme, but would fain have retracted his promises—and because the honest q—, unschool'd in the
<pb n="27" facs="30"/>
science of politicks, would not belye himself, and suffer the whole honour of the project to be ascribed solely to <hi>Chatwell,</hi>—did not <hi>Chatwell</hi> in place of rewarding, neglect, and insult him?—And as I'm well assured, had it not been for the generosity and truly patriotick application of Lord <hi>Shelter,</hi> the S—y, who solicited and obtained a pension for the original contriver of that conquest,—then in very deep distress—the resentment of <hi>Chatwell</hi> would have left the cheated q—, to have lamented in indigence the folly of a merchant, having forsook trade, to spend a fortune in the publick service!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>I have indeed heard as much—and farther—that although to demonstration, there never was a better concerted plan—yet—that unless it had been countenanced and enforced by Lord <hi>H—,</hi> all the q—'s fervency never could have moved the spirit of A—n, to have carried it into execution.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BL.</speaker>
<p>I believe that's true—for <hi>H—</hi> was certainly the first who adopted it, and as far as he had influence promoted it—<hi>H</hi>—is no bad man:—and I wish the execution of the d—d g— w— had fallen to any other m—r's share than his.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HON.</speaker>
<p>Well—but pray, tell me, what did the q— get by it at last?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>BLUNT.</speaker>
<p>Friend <hi>Honesty</hi>—the case is extremely different—The q— for the service of his country, had but one single object in view—upon the fate of that, he was willing to peril his life and all he was worth;—but it was still in the character of a merchant—if his project failed he was undone—if it succeeded, he hoped to avail himself, by some preference in the commercial way.—<hi>Watcher</hi>'s enthusiasm is of quite another fort—he penetrates into the bowels of a—n, he sees by what poison it has been infected—he is anxious to purge it—and will rather die, than leave it unrestored to its primitive constitution—he has abilities and perseverance—And while he breathes, he will flatter himself with being upheld by honest men.—That, at length, if not in the c— at least in the s—, he may be the terror of evil doers—Amen—so be it</p>

<speaker>MANS.</speaker>
<p>My lord! I'm sorry to tell it you, but it is truly my private opinion, that the master j—e, the o—rs, who gave orders to fire, and the rascals who left their stations, deserve all to be hanged!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>It must not be—or by G—d, I'm undone—If these poor fellows, who only acted under superior order, are given up—The whole army will be as much incensed, as the people are now!—My dear Lord—think how you may but screen us for this once; and I'll promise you that there never shall be any thing again countenanced on my part, without your lordship's advice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANS.</speaker>
<p>Why, my Lord, you never put a more difficult task upon me; if we had consented to take bail for <hi>Watcher</hi>—we might with some colour of justice have bailed the s—, and then the worst would have been a forfeiture of the bail:—But how in equity can we accept the bail of <hi>wilful murderers!</hi>—after having rejected it, in the case of ludicrous publications, will be something so repugnant to common sense, that every porter has judgment to reason upon the impropriety.—In a word, my Lord, they must be tried—and if condemned—you may obtain a pardon for them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTCH.</speaker>
<p>That will never do;—We most not impose such a hardship upon the—, he begins to think for himself—and his humane soul, is so resolutely inaccessible, to the most powerful intercessions in the case of murder, that the greatest favourites at c—t, would hazard their reputation, by the application.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>My Lord! I have every disposition in the world for your service; but you know how much the eyes of mankind are upon me; and therefore I will by no means condescend to take upon me the burthen of an affair which would make my

<p>Then the greatest difficulty is over—murder is one of the pl— of the c—.—Let a well-timed petition be presented—prepare the a— g— for it—And, if no objection is made, the thing will go of course, as if the j— knew nothing at all of the matter.</p>

<p>And pray, good master Constable, what bad consequence attended the crying out <hi>Watcher</hi> and <hi>Liberty?</hi></p>

<sp>
<speaker>CONS.</speaker>
<p>Bad consequence!—is not <hi>Watcher</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> consequence sufficient? is not <hi>Watcher</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> a heinous sin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="34"/>
<speaker>MANS.</speaker>
<p>No master constable, there is no more sin in the words <hi>Watcher</hi> and <hi>Liberty!</hi> than there is common sense in the word <hi>Constable</hi>—It is according as they are employed, that they are useful, or troublesome, to the community.—And I am afraid that you are as much mistaken in having brought these people before me; as they are mistaken in neglecting their business to cry out <hi>Watcher</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>— <stage>(to <hi>Jenny</hi>)</stage> and pray madam how comes a gentlewoman of your appearance to be amongst the rest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JENNY</speaker>
<p>For saying, my Lord! what I imagine your Lordship thinks—That this wiseacre of a constable, was—a fool!—I was accidentally passing by, saw these people, in no other act of rioting, than laughing and singing something about <hi>Watcher</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> and this sagacious gentleman having laid hold of them—I did tell him, that if he carried them before any judge, he would be laughed at for a fool!—So! madam, says the constable—you are a <hi>Watcherite</hi> too—along, along! you shall go with the rest!—Thus, my Lord, I have the honour to be presented to your lordship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANS.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, why is this gentlewoman brought here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONS.</speaker>
<p>Why? my Lord—I think, she's hanged by her own confession!—does she not own that she called a civil magistrate a fool, in the due execution of his office?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANS.</speaker>
<p>My good friend—It is not possible, in every case to suppress the truth—I'm afraid—when a constable acts foolishly—one may call him a fool—without incurring the censure of the law—let me advise you for your own sake to carry for the future, such offenders before some of the acting j— s— don't trouble me with them.—And in
<pb n="32" facs="35"/>
the mean time, you had best step in some where with these honest people, and take a reconciling pot, lest it should be put into their heads, to ask some questions about unlawful detention.—So, go about your business.</p>

<p>Your lordship's very obliging—but I have nothing to fear, except from such brutes as that there constable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I imagine not, madam!—men of larger abilities—would hardly terrify so pretty a creature as you <stage>(aside)</stage> "egad she's handsome."</p>

<sp>
<speaker>JEN.</speaker>
<p>My Lord!</p>
</sp>

<p>I say my dear—That men of the best understandings, are generally too partial to the sex; not to desire, rather to please, than frighten those so capable of charming!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEN.</speaker>
<p>Your Lordship's very good—And though your observation's rather favourable—It is not, I imagine, altogether unjust: for where will you find a gentleman of livelier parts than my opprest friend <hi>Jack Watcher!</hi> and surely our sex never had reason to doubt of his benevolence for 'em!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANS.</speaker>
<p>So madam!—I find at length, you are a well wisher to Mr. <hi>Watcher!</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEN.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my Lord—I avow it—and if your Lordship!—I mean—if every body would speak their sentiments as honestly as I do mine; <hi>Watcher</hi>
<pb n="33" facs="36"/>
would have avoided a great deal of distress, and your Lordship a great deal of trouble.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANS.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, madam! no politics!—Politics methinks comes as awkwardly from the lips of a fine woman as love would come from the lips of an old judge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEN.</speaker>
<p>And so, my Lord!—you would have me lay aside my awkwardness!—that your Lordship might put on yours!—but as the one subject could not be more disgustful to your lordship—than the other would to me—Your Lordship will please to excuse me,—my Lord I'm yours.</p>

<p>To that strange inconsistence can that same foolish passion lead a man?
