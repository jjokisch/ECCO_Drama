<head>TO Mrs. DANCER.</head>
<opener><salute>MADAM,</salute></opener>
<p>IN a country, where addresses of this nature have generally waited upon the Great, upon a Wealthy Merchant, a Rich Commissary, or some New Man from the Sugar-islands, it will appear as surprizing, to many, as, no doubt, it will to yourself, that a New Form of Dedication should now be introduced. For the trouble I am giving you it will, however, be unnecessary to make any further apology, when I observe that in France, where talents are honoured, it has been frequently the practice of the most celebrated wits to do justice to those, who, by their profession, are the very Organ of the Muses. A VOLTAIRE and a MARMONTEL have paid their compliments to a CLAIRON: and why may not an English Author, inferior as he is, and ever must be, to writers of that class, rival at least their politeness, by addressing himself to Mrs. DANCER, one of the first Ornaments of the British Theatre?</p>
<p>There are, indeed, I must confess it, some demands upon my gratitude on this occasion, which even now are struggling to call my attention another way. Mr. GARRICK, Madam, has a claim to all the handsome things that can be said of him. His politeness from the moment he saw the play, his assiduity in preparing it for representation, the taste with which he has decorated it, and the warmth of his zeal for the honour of the piece, are circumstances that call upon me for the strongest acknowledgements. I
<pb facs="4"/>
could employ my pen with pleasure in thanking Mr. BARRY for the very fine exertion of his powers, wherever the Poet gave the smallest opportunity. Mr. HOLLAND, who had before now given spirit to such scenes as mine, has renewed the obligation. I could add others to the list, but they, and even Mr. GARRICK at their head, must excuse me, if I turn to Mrs. DANCER, and say with <hi>Hamlet,</hi> "Here's mettle more attractive."</p>
<p>ZENOBIA, Madam, is your own entirely. Whereever my inaccuracy has left imperfections, they are so happily varnished over by your skill, that either they are not seen, or you extort forgiveness for them: and if the Author is any where happy enough to <hi>snatch a grace</hi> beyond his usual reach, it is multiplied by your address into a number of beauties, like the SWORD in <hi>Tasso'</hi>s <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which, when brandished by the hand of <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> appears to the whole army to be THREE SWORDS.</p>
<p>The fate of ZENOBIA has been very extraordinary. She was saved in her life-time from the waters of the <hi>Araxes</hi> by the hand of a shepherd, and now she is saved from the critics by Mrs. DANCER.</p>
<p>In testimony of the fact, the play, Madam, is now inscribed to you by him, who admires your talents, and remains</p>

<head>PROLOGUE:</head>
<sp>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. HOLLAND.</stage>
<lg>
<l>OF old,—when Greece in a declining age</l>
<l>Of lawless pow'r had felt the barb'rous rage.</l>
<l>This was the tyrant's art:—He gave a prize</l>
<l>To him, who a new pleasure should devise.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Ye tyrants of the Pit, whose cold disdain</l>
<l>Rejects and nauseates the repeated strain:</l>
<l>Who call for rarities to quicken sense,</l>
<l>Say, do you always the reward dispense?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Ye bards,—to whom French wit gives kind relief,</l>
<l>Are ye not oft the first—to cry STOP THIEF!</l>
<l>Say,—to a brother do you e're allow</l>
<l>One little sprig, one leaf to deck his brow?</l>
<l>No;—fierce invective stuns the play-wright's ears.</l>
<l>Wits, Poets corner, Ledgers, Gazetteers?</l>
<l>'Tis said, the Tartar,—e're he pierce the heart,</l>
<l>Inscribes his name upon his poison'd dart.</l>
<l>That scheme's rejected by each scribbling spark;</l>
<l>—Our Christian system—stabs you in the dark.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And yet the desp'rate author of to-night</l>
<l>Dares on the muses wing another flight;</l>
<l>Once more a dupe to fame forsakes his ease,</l>
<l>And feels th' ambition—here again to please.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>He brings a tale from a far distant age,</l>
<l>Enobled by the grave historic page!<note n="*" place="foot">Tacitus Ann. Lib. 12. Sect. 44, to end of 51.</note></l>
<l>Zenobia's woes have touch'd each polish'd state;</l>
<l>The brightest eyes of France have mourn'd her fate.</l>
<l>Harmonious Italy her tribute paid,</l>
<l>And sung a dirge to her lamented shade.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet think not that we mean to mock the eye</l>
<l>With pilfer'd colours of a foreign dye.</l>
<l>NOT to translate our bard his pen doth dip;</l>
<l>He takes a play, as Britons take a ship;</l>
<l>They heave her down;—with many a sturdy stroke,</l>
<l>Repair her well, and build with Heart of Oak.</l>
<l>To ev'ry breeze set Britain's streamers free,</l>
<l>NEW-MAN her, and away again to sea.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>This is our author's aim;—and if his art</l>
<l>Waken to sentiment the feeling heart;</l>
<l>If in hit scenes alternate passions burn,</l>
<l>And friendship, love, guilt, virtue take their turn;</l>
<l>If innocence oppress'd lie bleeding here.</l>
<l>You'll give—'tis all he asks—one VIRTUOUS TEAR.</l>

<l>THRO' the wide camp 'tis awful solitude!</l>
<l>On ev'ry tent, which at the morning's dawn</l>
<l>Rung with the din of arms, deep silence sits</l>
<l>Adding new terrors to the dreadful scene!</l>
<l>My heart dies in me!—hark!—with hideous roar</l>
<l>The turbulent Araxes foams along,</l>
<l>And rolls his torrent thro' yon depth of woods!</l>
<l>'Tis terrible to hear!—who's there?—Zopiron!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ZELMIRA.</speaker>
<l>My lord; my Husband!—help me; lend your aid!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOPIRON.</speaker>
<l>Why didst thou leave thy tent?—why thus afflict</l>
<l>Thy anxious breast, thou partner of my heart?</l>
<l>Why wilt thou thus distract thy tender nature</l>
<l>With groundless fears—er'e yonder sun shall visit</l>
<l>The western sky, all will be hush'd to peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZELMIRA.</speaker>
<l>The interval is horrid; big with woe,</l>
<l>With consternation, peril and dismay!</l>
<l>And oh! if here, while yet the fate of nations</l>
<l>Suspended hangs upon the doubtful sword,</l>
<l>If here the trembling heart thus shrink with horror,</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="8"/>
Here in these tents, in this unpeopled camp,</l>
<l>Oh! think, Zopiron, in yon field of death</l>
<l>Where number soon in purple heaps shall bleed,</l>
<l>What feelings there must throb in ev'ry breast?</l>
<l>How long, ambition, wilt thou stalk the earth</l>
<l>And thus lay waste-mankind!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOPIRON.</speaker>
<l>This day at length</l>
<l>The warlike king, victorious Pharasmanes</l>
<l>Closes the scene of war.—The Roman bands</l>
<l>But ill can cope with the embattled numbers</l>
<l>Asia pours forth, a firm undaunted host!</l>
<l>A nation under arms!—and every bosom</l>
<l>To deeds of glory fir'd!—Iberia then—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZELMIRA.</speaker>
<l>Perish Iberia!—may the sons of Rome</l>
<l>Pour rapid vengeance on her falling ranks,</l>
<l>That he, who tramples on the rights of nature,</l>
<l>May see his vassals over-whelm'd in ruin,</l>
<l>May from yon field be led in sullen chains,</l>
<l>To grace the triumph of imperial Rome,</l>
<l>And from th' assembled senate humbly learn</l>
<l>The dictates of humanity and justice!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOPIRON.</speaker>
<l>Thy generous zeal, thy ev'ry sentiment</l>
<l>Charms my delighted soul.—But thou be cautious,</l>
<l>And check the rising ardor that inflames thee.</l>
<l>The tyrant spares nor sex, nor innocence—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZELMIRA.</speaker>
<l>Indignant of controul, he spurns each law,</l>
<l>Each holy sanction, that restrains the nations,</l>
<l>And forms 'twixt man and man the bond of peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOPIRON.</speaker>
<l>This is the tryger's den; with human gore</l>
<l>For ever floats the pavement; with the shrieks</l>
<l>Of matrons weeping o'er their slaughter'd sons,</l>
<l>The cries of virgins to the brutal arms</l>
<l>Of violation dragg'd, with ceaseless groans</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="9"/>
Of varied misery for ever rings</l>
<l>The dreary region of his curs'd domain.</l>

<speaker>ZELMIRA.</speaker>
<l>To multiply his crimes, a beauteous captive,</l>
<l>Th' afflicted Ariana—she—for her,</l>
<l>For that fair excellence my bosom bleeds!</l>
<l>She, in the prime of ev'ry blooming grace,</l>
<l>When next the glowing hour of riot comes,</l>
<l>Shall fall a victim to his base desires—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOPIRON.</speaker>
<l>The bounteous gods may succour virtue still!</l>
<l>In this day's battle, which perhaps e're now</l>
<l>The charging hosts have join'd, should Roman valour</l>
<l>Prevail o'er Asia's numbers.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZELMIRA.</speaker>
<l>That event</l>
<l>Is all our hope.—And lo! on yonder rampart</l>
<l>Trembling with wild anxiety she stands,</l>
<l>Invokes each god, and bids her straining eye</l>
<l>Explore the distant field.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOPIRON.</speaker>
<l>Yes, there she's fix'd</l>
<l>A statue of dispair!—That tender bosom</l>
<l>Heaves with no common grief—I've mark'd her oft,</l>
<l>And if I read aright, some mighty cause</l>
<l>Of hoarded anguish, some peculiar woe</l>
<l>Preys on her mind unseen!—But, ha! behold,</l>
<l>She faints;—her fears too pow'rful for her frame</l>
<l>Sink that frail beauty drooping to the earth.</l>

<stage>Exit hastily.</stage>

<l>Haste, fly, Zopiron, fly with instant succour;</l>
<l>Support her; help her;—Lo! th' attendant train</l>
<l>Have caught her in their arms!—assist her Heav'n,</l>
<l>Assuage the sorrows of that gentle spirit!</l>
<l>Her flutt'ring sense returns;—and now this way</l>
<l>The virgins lead her.—May the avenging god!</l>
<l>In pity of the woes such virtue feels,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="10"/>
In pity of the wrongs a world endures,</l>

<l>That pride is virtue;—virtue that abhors</l>
<l>The tyrant reeking from a brother's murder!</l>
<l>Oh! Mithridates! ever honour'd shade!</l>
<l>—Peaceful he reign'd, dispensing good around him,</l>
<l>In the mild eve of honourable days!—</l>
<l>Thro' all her peopled realm Armenia felt</l>
<l>His equal sway;—the sunset of his pow'r</l>
<l>With fainter beams, but undiminish'd glory,</l>
<l>Still shone serene, while ev'ry conscious subject</l>
<l>With tears of praise beheld his calm decline</l>
<l>And bless'd the parting ray!—yet then, Zelmira,</l>
<l>Oh! fact accurs'd!—yes Pharasmanes then,</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="12"/>
Detested perfidy!—nor ties of blood,</l>
<l>Nor sacred laws, nor the just gods restrain him;—</l>
<l>In the dead midnight hour the fell assassin</l>
<l>Rush'd on the slumber of the virtuous man;—</l>
<l>His life blood gush'd;—the venerable king</l>
<l>Wak'd, saw a brother arm'd against his life,</l>

<l>Confirms his sceptre!—his!—indignant gods,</l>
<l>Will no red vengeance from your stores of wrath</l>
<l>Burst down to crush the tyrant in his guilt?</l>
<l>His sceptre, saidst thou?—urge that word no more—</l>
<l>The sceptre of his son!—the solemn right</l>
<l>Of Rhadamistus!—Mithridates choice,</l>
<l>That call'd him to his daughter's nuptial bed,</l>
<l>Approv'd him lineal heir;—consenting nobles,</l>
<l>The public will, the sanction of the Laws,</l>
<l>All ratified his claim;—yet curs'd ambition,</l>
<l>Deaf to a nation's voice, a nation's charter,</l>
<l>Nor satisfied to fill Iberia's throne,</l>

<speaker>TERIBAZUS.</speaker>
<l>THOU ar't a friend indeed, thou gen'rous man!</l>
<l>The best of friends, to save such innocence,</l>
<l>That lovely virgin bloom!—the pious act</l>
<l>Shall to remotest time transmit thy name,</l>
<l>Ennobled by humanity and virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RHADAMISTUS.</speaker>
<l>Alas! no praise I merit;—'tis a deed</l>
<l>That loses virtue's name—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TERIBAZUS.</speaker>
<l>Flamminius, no!</l>
<l>Thou shalt not derogate from worth like thine.</l>
<l>But oh! beware, my friend, and steel thy heart</l>
<l>Against the sweet illapse of gentler passions.</l>
<l>—To love her were such treachery!—by heav'n!</l>
<l>It were a fraud of a more damned hue—</l>
<l>A fraud to sacred friendship!—but my soul</l>
<l>Rejects the mean suspicion—thou ar't just,</l>
<l>And Ariana shall be mine again!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RHADAMISTUS.</speaker>
<l>If when the tumult of the war is pass'd,</l>
<l>You then persist to claim her—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TERIBAZUS.</speaker>
<l>Then persist!</l>
<l>—When I do not persist,—whene'er my heart</l>
<l>Forgets the fond idea—ha!—take heed—</l>
<l>Your colour dies by fits,—and how again</l>
<l>It flushes o'er your cheek—if beauty's pow'r</l>
<l>Can waken soft desire,—and sure such beauty</l>
<l>May warm the breast of stoic apathy,—</l>
<l>If thou can'st love,—resign the trust at once.</l>
<l>For oh! to lose her, to behold those charms.</l>
<l><pb n="48" facs="54"/>
That all-perfection yielded to another,</l>
<l>Were the worst agony, the keenest stab</l>
<l>That ever pierc'd a lover to the soul.—</l>

<speaker>RHADAMISTUS.</speaker>
<l><stage>(Aside)</stage> Not till the fever of his mind subsides,</l>
<l>Must I reveal me—the disclosure now</l>
<l>Would to his phrenzy give a whirlwind's wing,</l>
<l>And bury all in ruin—let her then;</l>
<l>Yes, Teribazus, let the blooming maid</l>
<l>Still in this camp, a Voluntary captive,</l>
<l>—Since you will have it so—since weak mistrust</l>
<l>Can taint a noble spirit,—let her here</l>
<l>Teach that rare beauty to display it's charms,</l>
<l>It's various graces;—bid those radiant eyes</l>
<l>Dart their quick glances to the tyrant's soul,</l>
<l>Inflame his hot desires, and half absolve them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TERIBAZUS.</speaker>
<l>Madness and horror!—no!—haste, fly, begone,</l>
<l>And give her hence safe-conduct—I can trust</l>
<l>To Roman continence—your Scipio's praise</l>
<l>Shall be the theme of fame's eternal lip!—</l>

<l>Infuses it's enchantment through his heart!</l>
<l>But when remov'd from Pharasmanes' pow'r</l>
<l>He learns my prior claim,—his gen'rous friendship</l>
<l>Will bound with transport at a brother's joys,</l>

<l>Rome had rather</l>
<l>Persuade than conquer—her well-ballanc'd justice—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHARASMANES.</speaker>
<l>No more of Roman justice—blazon not</l>
<l>Virtues you ne'er have practis'd—with the name,</l>
<l>The specious name of love for human kind</l>
<l>You sanctify th' insatiate rage of conquest,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHARASMANES.</speaker>
<l>From certain fugitives I've learn'd it all—</l>
<l>In yonder camp, conceal'd from vulgar eyes,</l>
<l>To war against his father still he lives!—</l>
<l>Why dost thou droop dejected?—something lurks</l>
<l>Beneath that burning blush—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RHADAMISTUS.</speaker>
<l>That burning blush</l>
<l>Glows on my cheek for thee—I know your son,</l>
<l>And know him unsusceptible of guilt.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHARASMANES.</speaker>
<l>Then, Roman, mark my words—would'st thou prevent</l>
<l>The carnage fate prepares on yonder plains?—</l>

<l>Why those emotions struggling for a vent?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RHADAMISTUS.</speaker>
<l>Amazement checks my voice, and lost in wonder</l>
<l>I view the unnatural father, who would bathe</l>
<l>His hands in blood,—in a son's blood—a son</l>
<l>Who pants,—with ardour pants,—on terms of peace</l>
<l>To sheathe the sword, and with a filial hand</l>
<l>To throw a veil over a father's crimes.</l>

<l>To ev'ry region, where his voice could pierce,</l>
<l>Has he not fled with the delusive story?</l>
<l>With grief and loud complaints inflam'd the world?</l>

<l>To the Araxe's banks with Rome in arms?</l>

<l>Tho' urg'd by dire constraint, yet heav'n can witness</l>
<l>His strong reluctance.—</l>

<l>Let the rebel know</l>
<l>He never shall ascend Armenia's throne.</l>

<l>And shall destruction with her horrid train</l>
<l>Stalk o'er the land?—</l>

<l>That deluges the land with human blood,</l>
<l>Is that a day of glory?—</l>
<l>I, Sir, have travers'd o'er the field of death,</l>
<l>Where war had spent its rage—hadst thou beheld</l>
<l>That scene of horror,—where unnumber'd wretches.</l>
<l>In mangled heaps lay welt'ring in their gore;</l>
<l>Where the fond father in the gasp of death</l>
<l>Wept for his children,—where the lover sigh'd</l>
<l>For her, whom never more his eyes could view;</l>
<l>Where various misery sent forth it's groans;—</l>
<l>Had'st thou beheld that scene,—the touch of nature</l>

<l>The father claims his son.—Have we not heard</l>
<l>How your own Brutus to the lictor's sword</l>
<l>Condemn'd his children?—and would Rome dispute</l>
<l>A king's paternal pow'r?—let 'em yield up</l>
<l>The treach'rous boy, or terrible in arms</l>

<speaker>PHARASMANES.</speaker>
<l>Whatsoe'er thy guilt</l>
<l>A smile from Ariana expiates all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MEGISTUS.</speaker>
<l>Believe me, Sir, I never have offended—</l>
<l>She was my sole delight; my ages comfort;—</l>
<l>For her I felt more than a parent's love—</l>
<l>But 'midst the troubles that distract the land</l>
<l>I lost her—in despair—with yearning heart</l>
<l>I rang'd the country round in fond pursuit—</l>
<l>This is my crime—sure 'tis no crime to love</l>
<l>Such blooming innocence!—</l>
</sp>

<l>Dispel thy fears—</l>
<l>Thy love for Ariana speaks thy virtue—</l>

<l>That bloom, those features, those love-darting eyes,</l>
<l>All, all attract, that there each fond admirer</l>
<l>Could ever gaze, enamour'd of her charms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MEGISTUS.</speaker>
<l>Alas! whate'er the symmetry of shape,</l>
<l><pb n="54" facs="60"/>
Whate'er the grace that reveals in her feature,</l>
<l>Glows in her bloom, or sparkles in her eye,</l>
<l>They all are transient beauties, soon to fade,</l>
<l>And leave inanimate that decent form.</l>
<l>Inward affliction saps the vital frame,</l>
<l>Incurable affliction!—fix'd in woe</l>
<l>Her eyes for ever motionless and dim</l>
<l>Gaze on the fancied image of her husband.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHARASMANES.</speaker>
<l>Her husband!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MEGISTUS.</speaker>
<l>Yes; a husband sever'd from her</l>
<l>By fatal chance!—him she for ever sees</l>
<l>With fancy's gushing eye, and seeks him still</l>
<l>In fond excursions of delusive thought.</l>
<l>She pines each hour, and ev'n in blooming dies,</l>
<l>As drooping roses,—while the worm unseen</l>
<l>Preys on their fragrant sweets, still beauteous look,</l>
<l>And waste their aromatic lives in air.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PHARASMANES.</speaker>
<l>The rose transplanted to a warmer sky</l>
<l>Shall raise it's languid head, and all be well.</l>

<l>Breathe the mild accents of a father's voice,</l>
<l>And reconcile her heart to love and me.</l>

<l>Each herb, each plant that drinks the morning dew,</l>

<l>For me to come among ye, would be madness:</l>
<l>This is no time for giggling—when you've leisure,</l>
<l>Call out for me, and I'll attend your pleasure;</l>

<l>And begg'd of her to take the task upon her;</l>
<l>But she,—I'm sure you'll all be sorry for't,</l>
<l>Resigns her place, and soon retires from court:</l>
<l>To bear this loss, we courtiers make a shift,</l>
<l>When good folks leave us, worse may have a lift.</l>

<l>And spite of all her virtue, and ambition,</l>

<l>Rais'd such a tragi-comic kind of pother,</l>
<l>You laugh'd with one eye, while you cry'd with t'other.</l>
<l>What can be done?—sad work behind the scenes!</l>
<l>There comic females scold with tragic queens.</l>
<l>Each party different ways the foe assails,</l>
<l>These shake their daggers, those prepare their nails.</l>
<l>'Tis You alone must calm these dire mishaps,</l>
<l>Or we shall still continue pulling caps.</l>
