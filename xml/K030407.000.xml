<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>THE success of a Dramatic piece on the Stage, depends, says Voltaire, upon accidental circumstances, but the day of publication decides its fate.</p>
<p>Persuaded of the truth of this remark, the Author of the Tragedy of Alfred would have submitted his performance, to the final judgment of the Reader, without preface or apology, if he had not been advised, and indeed urged, to make a reply to some hostile criticisms, which appear to have been founded upon prejudice and opinion, rather than reason and argument.</p>
<p>It has been alledged, that the character of Alfred, in the Tragedy, does not agree with the character of Alfred in History: "That the Hero, the Legislator, is degraded to a Lover, who enters the Danish camp, from a private, not a public, motive, and acts the part of an impostor."</p>
<p>In Tragedy, if the subject be Historical, an author is not permitted to introduce events, contrary
<pb n="iv" facs="3"/>
to the great established facts of History; for instance, in the Tragedy of Alfred, the Hero must not be killed, nor driven out of England by the Danes; but preserving those ancient foundations, as the piers of his bridge, the Author may bend his arches, and finish the fabrick, according to his taste and fancy, for the poet is at liberty, and it is the essence of his art, to invent such intermediate circumstances, and incidents, as he thinks will produce the most affecting situations. In this department, the Poet's fancy is controuled by nothing, but probability and consistence of character, the barriers of dramatic truth. Let us apply this principle to the point in dispute.</p>
<p>Alfred was a young man, when he fought the battle of Ethendune. The victory, which gave him possession of the kingdom, must have been gained before he begun to model the state, Is it improbable to suppose, that a young hero was in love? Is it inconsistent to represent the person, who was a Legislator when advanced in years, as a lover in his youth! Does it degrade the character of a hero to suppose, that he was in love with the princess whom he afterwards married? Is it not rather injurious to his heroism to conclude, that he chose a consort whom he did not love? If this reasoning is just, there will be no difficulty in vindicating the subsequent conduct of the hero. The dramatic and the real Alfred, are both involved in the charge of imposture; both entered the Danish camp in disguise; the previous events, as narrated in the tragedy, are nearly the same with those mentioned in history. Alfred, for almost two years, had wandered thro' England, concealing himself under feigned names and characters. He lived in the midst of his enemies, by being supposed to be dead. Emerging from this obscurity, he appears in the tragedy, and is informed of the alarming ambiguous situation of Ethelswida; his usual stratagems present themselves, one would think, naturally to his mind, extremely
<pb n="v" facs="4"/>
agitated, and prone both by temper and habit, to the most daring and romantic enterprizes. He resolves to enter the Danish camp, to learn the fate of Ethelswida, and observe the strength and order of the enemy's army, before he ventures a decisive engagement.</p>
<p>The continued artifice is inevitable. The conduct of Alfred, in the camp of Hinguar; the manner in which he deceives the Dane, is extremely similar to the conduct of Orestes in the Electra of Sophocles, which no critic hitherto has blamed. Orestes enters the palace of Aegisthus, as the messenger of his own death, carrying an urn, which contains (he says) the ashes of Orestes, whose untimely fate he most circumstantially relates. The Grecian hero practises the deceit with an intention to kill the persons whom he deceives. The English hero deceives Hinguar only to gain access to Ethelswida, without meaning to hurt the person of his enemy. To praise Sophocles, and blame the author of Alfred, for the same conduct, seems a direct contradiction, which can only be accounted for, in one way; an imaginary idea has been formed of the character of Alfred as an old mortified, ascetic sage, of spirit too sublime and aetherial to descend to human passions or human actions. But the real as well as the dramatic Alfred was a young hero, a bard, a winner of battles, brave and magnanimous, but compelled by the pressure of those desperate times, in which he lived, to practise a thousand arts to exist by simulation and dissimulation. Whoever recollects and weighs these circumstances, will it is presumed readily pardon the artifice of Alfred, in the Tragedy, and acknowledge that the <hi>feigned</hi> incidents of the piece are altogether consistent with the true. If not, the author must be contented to labour under the imputation of an erroneous judgment, for he meant nothing less than to degrade the character of Alfred; on the contrary, finding in the
<pb n="vi" facs="5"/>
records of a remote and barbarous age, a hero of great renown, but from the defect of his historians, involved in clouds and darkness:
Qui caput inter nubila condit.
he was tempted to seize his name, and display his character in new situations, connected with the old and well known events of his life and fortune. The play is printed as it was performed. An alteration has been made, in one scene, and sent to the Theatre, which, if the Tragedy should be resumed or revived, may perhaps contribute to heighten its effect.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<l>To furnish a new Prologue for each Play,</l>
<l>To dress the self-same dish, a different way;</l>
<l>Exhausts the poet's art. And every year,</l>
<l>Palates grow nicer, rarities more dear.</l>
<l>The cabinet, who in the green room sit,</l>
<l>The secret junto of the realm of wit;</l>
<l>In these hard times, resolved their stock to spare,</l>
<l>And crib the Prologue from the bill of fare.</l>
<l><hi>Alfred</hi> on English ground <hi>alone</hi> may stand,</l>
<l>The darling hero of his native land:</l>
<l><hi>No, no,</hi> our Poet cry'd<hi>—this is no time,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Nor is it prudent now to save your rhime;</hi></l>
<l><hi>Fir'd with my subject I have rashly dar'd,</hi></l>
<l><hi>And you in Prologue should protect your bard:</hi></l>
<l><hi>When my adventurous muse, indulg'd before,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Now vent'ring further, needs indulgence more;</hi></l>
<l><hi>She dares to trace the workings of a mind,</hi></l>
<l><hi>The greatest and the best of human kind;</hi></l>
<l><hi>Adjust its movements to dramatic plan,</hi></l>
<l><hi>And blend the god-like hero with the man.</hi></l>
<l>The greater <hi>Alfred's</hi> fame, our bard risks more;</l>
<l>Such weight the flying courser never bore.</l>
<l><hi>Alfred!</hi> whose life such strange events adorn,</l>
<l>That history beholds romance with scorn;</l>
<l>Him to present, here in his native land,</l>
<l>Where still his genius, and his laws command,</l>
<l>Is an attempt like his, who rashly tried,</l>
<l>The burning chariot of the sun to guide!</l>
<l>Yet this attempt from admiration rose,</l>
<l>Nor should <hi>he</hi> find in <hi>Alfred</hi>'s kingdom foes:</l>
<l>He, who by temper led, not love of fame,</l>
<l>Is the fond echo of your hero's name.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>BY Mr. GARRICK.</byline>
<l>OUR bards of late, so tragic in their calling,</l>
<l>Have scarce preserv'd one <hi>heroine</hi> from falling:</l>
<l>Whether the dame be widow, maid, or wife,</l>
<l>She seldom from <hi>their</hi> hands escapes with life:</l>
<l>If this green cloth could speak, would it not tell,</l>
<l>Upon its well-worn nap how oft I fell?</l>
<l>To death in various forms deliver'd up,</l>
<l>Steel kills me one night, and the next the <hi>Cup:</hi></l>
<l>The tragic process is as short, as certain;</l>
<l>With <note n="*" place="foot">She makes the motion of stabbing.</note> <hi>THIS,—</hi>or <note n="†" place="foot">And here of drinking poison.</note> <hi>THIS,</hi> I drop—then drops the curtain!</l>
<l>No saint can lead a better life than I,</l>
<l>For half is spent in study'ng how to die.</l>
<l>The learn'd dispute, how Tragedies should end;</l>
<l><hi>O happily</hi> say some—Some <hi>death</hi> defend:</l>
<l><hi>Mild</hi> criticks wish good fortune to the good;</l>
<l>While others <hi>hot-brain'd,</hi> roar for blood! blood! blood!—</l>
<l>The fair, tho' nervous, tragic to the soul,</l>
<l>Delights in daggers, and the poison'd bowl:</l>
<l><hi>"I would not give a black-pin for a Play,</hi></l>
<l><hi>"Unless in tenderness I melt away:</hi></l>
<l><hi>"From pangs, and death no lovers would I save,</hi></l>
<l><hi>"They should be wretched, and despairand rave;</hi></l>
<l><hi>"And ne'er together lie—but in the grave!"</hi></l>
<l>The brave <hi>rough soldier,</hi> a <hi>soft</hi> heart discovers;</l>
<l>He swears and weeps at once, when dead the lovers:</l>
<l>As down his cheeks run trickling nature's tide,</l>
<l><hi>"Damn it—I wish those young ones had not dy'd:"</hi></l>
<l><pb facs="8"/>
Tho' from his eyes the drop of pity falls,</l>
<l>He fights like <hi>Caesar,</hi> when his country calls:</l>
<l>In spite of critic laws, our bard takes part,</l>
<l>And joins in concert with the soldier's heart:</l>
<l>O let <hi>your</hi> feelings with his party side,</l>
<l>For once forgive me that I have not dy'd;</l>
<l>Too hard that fate, which kills a <hi>virgin bride.</hi></l>

<l>THE name of Surrey and the shield he bore,</l>
<l>With ease deceived the unsuspecting soldier:</l>
<l>I knew the port of Alfred.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEVONSHIRE.</speaker>
<l>So he thought;</l>
<l>And, ere he laid his weary limbs to rest,</l>
<l>Gave me, in charge, to warn thee to be silent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="11"/>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>My lord of Devonshire, on me depend.</l>
<l>Steel shall not tear the secret from my breast;</l>
<l>Astonish'd as I am, at such a secret;</l>
<l>Who can unfold the cause? Why, at this hour,</l>
<l>When, big with England's fate, each moment rolls,</l>
<l>Does Alfred hide himself, in clouds and darkness?</l>
<l>And spread uncertain rumours of his state,</l>
<l>Confounding all belief?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEVONSHIRE.</speaker>
<l>He spread them not.</l>
<l>From his uncertain fate, those rumours rose.</l>
<l>Ere since that time, when the perfidious Dane</l>
<l>Attack'd the English, in the hour of peace;</l>
<l>On Alfred's wedding day.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>It was believed,</l>
<l>That Alfred, in the general carnage, fell,</l>
<l>At Cyppenham; that, in the swelling flood</l>
<l>Of wintry Avon, Ethelswida perish'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEVONSHIRE.</speaker>
<l>Such was the first report.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>Fain would I hear</l>
<l>Th' eventful tale of much-enduring Alfred;</l>
<l>And what is yet of Ethelswida known.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEVONSHIRE.</speaker>
<l>When faithless Hinguar, with his host, advanc'd,</l>
<l>The King, distracted for his lovely bride,</l>
<l>Sent off a hundred knights, by Surrey led,</l>
<l>To guard the Princess to a place of safety:</l>
<l>Then, furious, fac'd the Dane;—with odds opprest.</l>
<l>Around their King, his faithful nobles fell,</l>
<l>Alfred, by favour of the night, escap'd,</l>
<l>And wander'd long, obscure, from place to place.</l>
<l>Thro' woods and forests, like some beast of prey,</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="12"/>
By cruel hunters chac'd. Much he endur'd;</l>
<l>And much his people suffer'd. English virtue,</l>
<l>Like England's oak, grew firmer from the storm.</l>
<l>Often the peasant his last morsel brought</l>
<l>To the dark wood or cave, where Alfred lay;</l>
<l>If questioned by the Dane, denied the deed;</l>
<l>And died, undaunted, to preserve his prince.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>The story▪ thrills my blood; by heaven and earth—</l>
<l>Where did he rest at last?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEVONSHIRE.</speaker>
<l>He never rested;</l>
<l>Even when he had a place of refuge found;</l>
<l>Where the deep winding streams, Parret and Thone</l>
<l>Their waters mix, a little island lies,</l>
<l>With alders overgrown. No name it had,</l>
<l>Tho' now the name of Athelney it bears.</l>
<l>Marshes and pools, by inundation form'd,</l>
<l>Perplex the dire approach. There Alfred fix'd</l>
<l>His dreary habitation. Two brave knights</l>
<l>At first were all his train. Day after day</l>
<l>The numbers grew; and many a gallant knight,</l>
<l>Found out the wild asylum of his Lord.</l>
<l>From thence, with inroads fierce, they gall'd the Dane.</l>
<l>Dark as the spirits of the night they came,</l>
<l>And vanish'd at the dawn: In that retreat,</l>
<l>The sun, thro' every sign, o'er Alfred roll'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>Did Ethelswida there rejoin her Lord?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEVONSHIRE.</speaker>
<l>Nor she herself, nor any of her train,</l>
<l>Have ere been heard of, since she left her Lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>For certain, then, she lives. If she had perish'd,</l>
<l>Her fate would have been known.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="13"/>
<speaker>DEVONSHIRE.</speaker>
<l>The Danes ascrib'd</l>
<l>To me the inroads made by daring Alfred;</l>
<l>And both the Danish princes took the field.</l>
<l>Hinguar, with fire and sword laid waste the land.</l>
<l>Hubba, his host to Kenwith castle led,</l>
<l>And, with strong siege, begirt my ancient towers.</l>
<l>Then Alfred issued from his lonely isle,</l>
<l>Conceal'd, as now, beneath another name.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>Did Alfred fight in Kenwith's bloody field?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEVONSHIRE.</speaker>
<l>He fix'd the fortune of that doubtful day.</l>
<l>When Hubba with his life the REAFEN lost,</l>
<l>Th' inchanted standard, on whose magic wings</l>
<l>Conquest, till then, had flown. The battle won,</l>
<l>Alfred, impatient, bent his rapid course</l>
<l>To Westmorland; where, as he fondly hop'd</l>
<l>His Ethelswida dwelt. He found her not;</l>
<l>And, late last night, in deep despair, return'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>I see the clouded tract, thro' which he pass'd</l>
<l>Invisible.—Now he has reach'd the point,</l>
<l>And will break forth in splendor. We shall fight</l>
<l>To-morrow or to-day.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEVONSHIRE.</speaker>
<l>On these steep hills.</l>
<l>By nature and by art, impregnable,</l>
<l>Which far and wide command Wiltonia's vale.</l>
<l>In absence of the King, my camp I pitch'd.</l>
<l>Audacious Hinguar occupies the plain,</l>
<l>And braves us to descend.</l>

<l>That fatal night,</l>

<l>We found no refuge there.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALFRED.</speaker>
<l>Too well I know,</l>
<l>The Scots had raz'd Pendragon's lofty tower:</l>
<l>Then, whither didst thou fly?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<l>There I dismiss'd</l>
<l>Most of my faithful Knights. A few I kept,</l>
<l>Of chosen men the choice. Eastward we steer'd,</l>
<l>Towards the wilds, beyond the source of Tine.</l>
<l>By midnight marches, in untrodden paths,</l>
<l>That wind o'er mountains vast, thro' valley's deep;</l>
<l>We reach'd a lonely mansion, in a dale,</l>
<l>Which at the foot of snow-clad Cheviot lies.</l>
<l>There Ethelswida found a safe retreat;</l>
<l>And in those deserts wild, she might have dwelt,</l>
<l>Unheard of and unknown.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALFRED.</speaker>
<l>Why did she not?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SURREY,</speaker>
<l>The rumour of thy death a tempest rais'd,</l>
<l>Which, from that harbour, drove her out to sea.</l>
<l>On me she laid her absolute commands,</l>
<l>To guide and guard her, as I could, to Kenwith:</l>
<l>My friends I warn'd to meet us on our way,</l>
<l>And on we went, till one unhappy time,</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="18"/>
The Danes surpriz'd us in a narrow vale.</l>
<l>Against their fierce attack, our little band,</l>
<l>Around the Princess, form'd a fence of steel.</l>
<l>More and more narrow still the circle grew,</l>
<l>Till I alone was left with Ethelswida.</l>
<l>Alone I fought, till at her feet I fell.</l>
<l>Her dismal shrieks, her piercing cries I heard;</l>
<l>More grievous sar, than all the wounds I bore.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALFRED.</speaker>
<l>Methinks I hear her cries: She call'd on Alfred;</l>
<l>Did she not, Surrey? Providence divine!</l>
<l>Why was not Alfred near?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<l>As I have heard,</l>
<l>From some who in the troops of Hinguar fought,</l>
<l>For he it was who led the hostile band,</l>
<l>She swoon'd with grief and terror on the spot.</l>
<l>The Dane to her unwonted pity show'd,</l>
<l>And rais'd her from the ground.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALFRED.</speaker>
<l>Tell me the truth;</l>
<l>Do not deceive me, Surrey.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<l>O, my Lord,</l>
<l>I never did, nor will l now deceive thee!</l>
<l>But of the Princess this I only know,</l>
<l>That in the Danish camp, she still remains,</l>
<l>Guarded with care, her name and rank unknown.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALFRED.</speaker>
<l>What should I think! Can she submit to live—</l>
<l>To live, her honour lost? How didst thou 'scape</l>
<l>From such a slaughter? And how cam'st thou hither,</l>
<l>Commission'd by the Dane?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<l>When night came on,</l>
<l>Some English peasants, who had seen the fight,</l>
<l>Crept from their huts, in secret, to the field,</l>
<l>With pious purpose to inter the dead.</l>
<l>In me alone, some sparks of life they found.</l>
<l>Their care preserv'd me. When my strength return'd,</l>

To Hinguar's camp I went, gave out myself</l>

<l>Favour in Hinguar's sight; and, in the band</l>

<l>Didst thou not mark, when first I heard thy voice,</l>
<l>How real passion mingled with the feign'd?</l>
<l>When I beheld thee risen from the grave,</l>
<l>And braving death again for Ethelswida,</l>
<l>The veil of frenzy scarce conceal'd my transport.</l>

<l>Whose spacious kingdoms can, with ease, contain</l>
<l>The rival nations; and the fertile fields</l>

<l>Let us divide the Land, and join in league</l>

<l>Ruin'd I am; but it was human weakness,</l>
<l>And no disgraceful fault, that ruin'd Alfred.</l>
<l>Impell'd by tender, anxious, jealous love;</l>
<l>Despising danger, to thy tents I came;</l>
<l>And dost thou think I am so quickly alter'd?</l>
<l>Dost thou imagine, that the dread of death</l>
<l>Can move my soul to yield to thee my bride?</l>
<l>And lead, if she would follow me, to shame?</l>
<l>Hinguar, the meanest man of Saxon race,</l>
<l>In freedom born would from such baseness shrink;</l>
<l>And scorn, with insamy, to purchase life.</l>

<l>The victor, not the murderer, of her husband.</l>

<l>The beauteous Ethelswida has consented</l>

<l>Now, where is Hinguar's pride?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HINGUAR.</speaker>
<l>Here, in his heart,</l>
<l>Unconquer'd still the pride of Hinguar dwells.</l>
<l>To die in battle is a warrior's death.</l>
<l>The hero fights and falls; but never yields.</l>
<l>Hinguar has fought. From sea to sea, his sword,</l>
<l>Thro' England blaz'd, a meteor dropping blood.</l>
<l>The wolf and eagle followed to the feast,</l>
<l>Tracking its course. The warrior, old in arms.</l>
<l>The youthful chief, by many a virgin lov'd,</l>
<l>Lay reeking in their gore.</l>
</sp>

<l>As thou dost now!</l>

That starve on hill of snow, how durst thou lift</l>
<l>Thy cursed hand?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HINGUAR.</speaker>
<l>No. Ethelswida fell</l>
<l>By Ronex. Yet, altho' I killed her not,</l>
<l>Her death delights me. Saxon, I rejoice</l>
<l>At thy calamity. Happy my lot,</l>
<l>Compar'd with thine. To the Valkyrian maids</l>
<l>I go, to Odin and the hall of joy.</l>
<l>Thou of thy love bereft, shalt waste thy days,</l>
<l>In lamentation, like the wretch who pines</l>
<l>By Hela's lake and drinks the poison'd stream,</l>
<l>Pour'd from the jaws of snakes. I laugh at thee,</l>
<l>And, like my fathers, die.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ALFRED.</speaker>
<l>His dying voice</l>
<l>Of me prophetic spake. O, Ethelswida!</l>
<l>And Surrey too! in Alfred's cause has fallen.</l>
<l>Now on the top, the summit of affliction,</l>
<l>Like a tree, stript of bark and branch, I stand,</l>

<l>But words are vain. Let those bewail their doom,</l>
<l>Who live to suffer, and prolong their pain.</l>
<l>The gleam of hope, extinguish'd by despair,</l>

<speaker>ETHELSWIDA.</speaker>
<l>He lives, he lives!</l>
<l>My heart surcharg'd, bursts with a flood of joy.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ETHELSWIDA.</speaker>
<l>Alfred! Gracious heaven!</l>
<l>For ever blest thy Providence divine!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALFRED.</speaker>
<l>In error lost, upon the brink we stood,</l>
<l>Of bottomless perdition. O, my love,</l>
<l>Most certain seem'd thy death.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ETHELSWIDA,</speaker>
<l>I saw thee dead,</l>
<l>And rais'd my arm to join my lot to thine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALFRED.</speaker>
<l>I heard the dagger fall. It was reserv'd</l>
<l>For thee, thou pride and glory of thy sex,</l>
<l>To give the noblest proof of love—and live.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ETHELSWIDA.</speaker>
<l>Ere since the sad commencement of our woes,</l>
<l>Deep on my heart engrav'd was the resolve,</l>
<l>Not to survive thee in the storms of fortune.</l>
<l>That anchor held like fate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALFRED.</speaker>
<l>Whence came that sign</l>
<l>Which friends and foes deceived?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ETHELSWIDA.</speaker>
<l>True was the sign</l>
<l><pb n="62" facs="71"/>
Of death. The wearer of my garment died,</l>
<l>For me mistaken.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALFRED.</speaker>
<l>'Twas a wounded mind.</l>
<l>Which laid me low. Oppress'd with grief I sunk.</l>
<l>Edwin, my friend—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEVONSHIRE.</speaker>
<l>Compleat is Edwin's joy</l>
<l>To see his Prince with love and glory crown'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALFRED.</speaker>
<l>The scene is ghastly, and with death deform'd.</l>
<l>In place more fitting, of our friends and foes</l>
<l>According to desert, we will decree.</l>
<l>The nations now are one; with Hinguar died</l>
<l>The enmity of England and of Denmark.</l>
<l>My people with their monarch shall be blest</l>
<l>Whilst such a partner of my empire reigns.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ETHELSWIDA.</speaker>
<l>Nor shall the story of the toils of Alfred,</l>
<l>Sink to oblivion, in the tide of time,</l>
<l>Or to posterity descend in vain.</l>
<l>From hence the people of the land he lov'd;</l>
<l>And future Princes of that land may learn,</l>
<l>Fearless to stem the torrent of disaster,</l>
<l>And ne'er of England, or themselves, despair.</l>
