<stage><hi>Enter First and Second</hi> LADIES.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Ist LADY.</speaker>
<p>WHO do you think is the Emperor's favourite now: whilst I continued his favourite myself, I had no occasion to make any enquiry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>You may be the Emperor's again: as to me, I shall never enjoy his favour—But here she comes.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> 3d Lady.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>3d <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>So, here you are musing and plotting mischief against me, because the Sultan loves me; well, the woman who possesses his heart, is sure to have every woman in the Seraglio against her: but there was a time when you was kind to me.</p>
<stage><hi>(to the</hi> Ist Lady.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ist <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes my dear Sophie, when you was in distress: and I assure you, that if ever that time should come again, we will be as kind again, and love you as well as ever.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>3d <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>You think so—however our sex are seldom kind to the woman that is so prosperous, their pity is
<pb n="2" facs="4"/>confined to those that are forsaken—to be forsaken and ugly, are the greatest distresses a woman can have.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ist <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>Let her go, a good for nothing happy creature, however by some accident she is the favourite now, perhaps some of us may become favourites soon—sister—what's that— <stage>(looking at the upper entrance)</stage> I tremble all over.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am afraid it is a great ravenous bird, coming to devour us, is it a fowl? Perhaps it is the chariot of some of the gods of the Gentoos.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ist <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh, no it cannot be a bird, it has no wings—perhaps this is our Prophet Mahomet coming to earth again, and this is his chariot—It is—they are gods, I see their heads. <stage>(Balloon descends)</stage> Let us not be afraid if they bear the shape of men (as gods they say mostly do) let us face them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>2d <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh dear heart!—Stay—I never saw a god in all my life, and yet if they come in the shape of men, why I don't think I should be so much afraid of them neither.</p>

<stage>[Exit.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Johnny, Fanny <hi>and</hi> Doctor.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>O! dear! O! dear!—The devil take all balloons I say—what a cursed confounded journey we have had of it—Fan, come out—where the devil are we after all—In Scotland, Denmark or Ireland, or Norway, or Limbo, it is devilish hot <stage>(fans himself with his hat)</stage> why Fan, where are yon Fan!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fan.</speaker>
<p>I'm here Johnny—Oh! Lord! I am so glad to set my foot on christian ground again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>Christian ground you fool! why we're in Limbo—it must be Limbo, or Greenland. Doctor what say you, it is Greenland, is it not?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doc.</speaker>
<p>Why man Greenland is cold, quite reverse of this climate; this is either east, west or south, but which I cannot tell. I am sure it is not north, by the heat, other conclusions I draw from other causes; I know we are a thousand miles from our native land, from the swiftness of our machines motion, and the
<pb n="3" facs="5"/>length of time we have been in it; another conclusion is, that not knowing the paths we have come, we know not where we are—I know only that we are in a close walk of trees with houses at a distance; we may be amongst people, who pay no regard to genius, science, or invention, but may put us all to death, taking us for three witches that ride in the air.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fan.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Lord! put us all to death!—is all our fine ride in the air come to this—Oh, Lord! O Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>Ay Fan, and how the people clapp'd and huzza'd, when they saw us mount in the air!—They little thought they should not see us again, Gad that was the reason may be that they seem'd so glad—for my part I was so pleas'd with my journey, I was almost out of my wits for joy; I did not think that we should have no more than a couple of hours ride. I thought we should have been picked up in Essex, Darby, or Kent, or Middlesex or thereabouts, but the devil a bit! the Doctor with all his magic could not stop it when it was set a-going.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doc.</speaker>
<p>I own I am shock'd at our adventure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>Well here we are after all—but where, the Lord only knows.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doc.</speaker>
<p>Do you appear lighter—I am much more heavy than in my natural element.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>Ay Doctor, like a fish out of water.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doc.</speaker>
<p>I do not speak to you of elements.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>I am sure doctor I wish you hadn't brought us out of our element.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doc.</speaker>
<p>Your soul and body are composed of one element, and that is earth, and your wise is all water.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fan.</speaker>
<p>Ay Doctor, with now and then a spark of fire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>Damme Doctor, you are all air, and yet you have not enough of it to take as back again neither.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doc.</speaker>
<p>I may be able to fill that machine again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>I wish you would fill our bellies in the meantime, upon my soul I am half starved.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doc.</speaker>
<p>The pure air we breath'd while so many degrees above the earth, supplied every want.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="6"/>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>No, not it Doctor, you know you eat heartily of the ham and chickens, and drank more of the wine than Fan and I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fan.</speaker>
<p>That he did.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doc.</speaker>
<p>That was only by way of experiment, I had no wants I assure you.</p>

<speaker>Doc.</speaker>

<p>Oh, ho, ho, ho.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ist <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>In the Seraglio of his favourite concubines, where no mortal but himself dare approach in human shape, except our wretched sex, and Eunuchs who are our guards.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>Eunuchs! Lord madam they are of no sex at all—we have often heard madam of the Great Mogul. Why Lord he can't be jealous of me, and as to the Doctor there he is nobody—it is all over with him, he has no longer any inflammible air about him, either in his balloon or himself, its all gone, is'nt it Doctor?</p>

<p>Hyde Park corner!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fan.</speaker>
<p>Yes, just by the turnpike going to Knight's bridge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>And after sailing a month like a poor school boy's kite, we are thrown into the jaws of that damn'd cutthroat dog the Great Mogul.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ist <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>What do you say?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>I did'n't mean your Mogul, madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ist <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>You must take care what you say, you are my fellow creatures, and you are brought here by this strange Machine—take care the Mogul Eunuchs are constantly on the watch, the time draws night, when they will enter this dwelling: be prepared to give an account of yourselves, who, and what you are, and substantial excuses for your being found here, or you assuredly die in misery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>Doctor! why damme Doctor, what's the matter with you—you are ship'd Doctor, damme I say what's the matter with you—Contrive something to say to the Great Mogul.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doc.</speaker>
<p>I cannot contrive any thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fan.</speaker>
<p>You contriv'd the Balloon and be hang'd to you, and you contriv'd to get us here, now contrive to take us back again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doc.</speaker>
<p>At present I cannot, all my inflammible air is gone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>I told you so—its all over with him, and with us too I fear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fan.</speaker>
<p>Oh, dear Johnny, what will become of us, what will become of us?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>Come, don't cry Fan, we shall see our children again, never fear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ist <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>As to that female, she has nothing to apprehend for herself, she will be saved from death, and most likely exalted to the embraces of the Great Mogul.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fan.</speaker>
<p>I had rather not madam, if its all the same to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="8"/>
<speaker>Ist <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>I only speak of what is probable, but prepare an excuse, I must call here the Eunuch and inform him of what has happen'd, or we shall be greatly suspected, and punished with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>Pray madam, are these Eunuchs a good sort of gentlemen?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ist <hi>La.</hi></speaker>
<p>They are severe, but they do but their duty—They obey their master, who meant them to be severe—if possible make them your friends, by all means.</p>

<p>Doctor, what shall we do? what the devil shall we do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Doc.</speaker>
<p>I shall fare the worst, the Mogul will consider me as some important personage, some capital conspirator perhaps, and I have no doubt, but he will arrest me and flee me alive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>John.</speaker>
<p>And I have no doubt but he'll arrest me too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Ay, he will eat us all alive, you won'd come Johnny.</p>

<p>My Johnny and I sitting so comfortable together at breakfast, where we had pawn'd your waistcoat to get one, with one child crying on my knee, and one on yours; my poor old mother shaking with the ague, in one corner of the room—the many happy

Yes from you Christians whose laws teach charity to all the world, have I learn'd these virtues? For your countrymen's cruelty to the poor Gentoos has shewn me tyranny in so foul a light, that I was determined henceforth to be only mild, just and merciful.—You have done wrong, but you are strangers, you are destitute—You are too much in my power to treat you with severity—all three may freely depart.</p>
