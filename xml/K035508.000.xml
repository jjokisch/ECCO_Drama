<pb facs="2"/>
<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>THE Plot of this Comedy, as far as regards Rivers's visits to Modish and Mrs. Ormond, was taken from the Novel of Sidney Biddulph; Mr. Sheridan had already borrowed the same incident from the same source, and employed it (though in a different manner) in the "School for Scandal."</p>
<p>The "East Indian" was admirably well acted from beginning to end, particularly the part of Rivers by Mr. Kemble: nothing was overcharged, nothing under-acted. Indeed, to call his performance <hi>acting,</hi> is doing it injustice: It was nature throughout.</p>
<p>This Comedy was written before I was sixteen. It was performed last season for the benefits of Mrs. Jordan and Mrs. Powell, and, in consequence of the approbation with which it was received, was brought forward again in last December. It was again received with applause, for which I thank the Public: the succeeding representations did not prove attractive, for which I here make my acknowledgments to Mr. Sheridan, who blocked up
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
my road, mounted on his great tragic war-horse Pizarro, and trampled my humble pad-nag of a Comedy under foot without the least compunction. My Readers must decide, whether my Play merited so transient an existence; it is unnecessary to say, that <hi>I</hi> am quite of the contrary opinion.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>By the Author.</byline>
<byline>SPOKEN BY MR. C. KEMBLE.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>IN life's gay spring, while yet the careless hours</l>
<l>Dance light on blooming beds of early flowers,</l>
<l>Ere knowledge of the world has taught the mind</l>
<l>To sorrow for itself and shun mankind,</l>
<l>In sweet vain dreams still Fancy bids the boy</l>
<l>Doat on fair prospects of ideal joy:</l>
<l>Life's choicest fruits then court his eager hand;</l>
<l>Each eye is gentle, and each voice is bland;</l>
<l>False friendship prompts no sigh, and draws no tear,</l>
<l>And love seems scarce more beauteous, than sincere!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Ere sixteen years had wing'd their wanton flight,</l>
<l>While yet his head was young, and heart was light,</l>
<l>Our author plann'd these scenes; and while he drew,</l>
<l>How bright each colour seem'd, each line how true.</l>
<l>Gods! with what rapture every speech he spoke!</l>
<l>Gods! how he chuckled as he penn'd each joke!</l>
<l>And when at length his ravish'd eyes survey</l>
<l>That wondrous work complete—a Five Act Play,</l>
<l>His youthful heart how self applauses swell!</l>
<l>—"It isn't perfect, but its vastly well!"—</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Since then, with many a pang, our Bard has bought</l>
<l>More just decision, and less partial thought:</l>
<l>Kind vanity no longer blinds his sight,</l>
<l>His fillet falls, and lets in odious light.</l>
<l>Time bids the darling work its leaves expand,</l>
<l>Each flower Parnassian withers in his hand;</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="5"/>Stern judgement every latent fault detects,</l>
<l>And all its fancied beauties prove defects.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet, for she thinks some scenes possess an art</l>
<l>To please the fancy, and to melt the heart,</l>
<l>Thalia bids his play to-night appear,</l>
<l>Thalia call'd in heaven, but Jordan here<note n="*" place="foot">The Comedy was first performed for the Benefit of Mrs. Jordan.</note>.</l>
<l>So frail his hope, so weak he thinks his cause,</l>
<l>Our author says he dares not ask applause;</l>
<l>He only begs, that with indulgence new,</l>
<l>You'll hear him patiently, and hear him through:</l>
<l>Then, if his piece proves worthless, never sham it;</l>
<l>But damn it, gentle friends—Oh! damn it! damn it!</l>

<stage>WALSINGHAM <hi>is seated by a Table</hi>; ROBERT <hi>waiting.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>WALSINGHAM.</speaker>
<p>BEAUCHAMP, say you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROB.</speaker>
<p>I think, that's the gentleman's name, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Show him up—
<stage>[<hi>Exit</hi> Robert.]</stage>
—I'm glad that he's returned to England; for, though a young man, and a gay man, Beauchamp is among the few whom I esteem.</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> BEAUCHAMP.</stage>
<p>My dear Ned!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Walsingham!—This pleasure is quite unexpected; but where have you been concealed these hundred years? I was afraid, that Cynthia wearied of her Endymion had pitched upon <hi>you</hi> for his successor, and believed you at this moment an inhabitant of the moon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>No, no, my young friend; the goddess has too much taste to select such an old weather-beaten fellow for a Cecisbeo. But if you seriously ask, what I've been doing for these last three years, you must know, I've been fool-hunting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Fool-hunting?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Yes. Being of an adust cynical constitution, infinite laughter is absolutely necessary for my health: for this purpose my physician prescribed me a course of fools, and truly I've reaped great benefit from his advice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Why then leave Great Britain? Heaven knows, a scarcity of fools is not one of our wants!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>True; but the growth of English absurdity for the year 95 not being to my taste, I determined to change my fools, as other invalids change the air; but after all I must give the preference to the folly of my own country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Your own country is very much obliged to you; but since this is your taste, I've a superb feast for you in Lord Listless.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>What, your uncle?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>No; to my sorrow he sleeps with his fore-fathers, while my noble cousin possesses his title and estate, and, what is worst, has me entirely in his power.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>How so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a tedious story; but the short of it is, that when I married, my generous uncle discharged my debts to the tune of 3OOOl.: unluckily he neglected to destroy my acknowledgment, which falling into his son's hands, the present Earl wisely keeps it, and calls himself my sole creditor. Discharge it for some time I cannot;
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
but, however, unless we disagree, he will not press me for immediate payment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, and even if he should, we'll find means to satisfy him; and so away with that gloomy face, dear Ned! As soon as I saw you, I guessed that something was wrong; but I'm glad, 'twas nothing more than a pecuniary difficulty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Would to heaven, it were!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Hey? Why what other cause—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Mr. Walsingham, how shall I tell you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Out with it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>That I have been—That I still am—a villain!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>I don't believe one word of it: he, who dares own that he has been a villain, must needs already have ceased to be one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Hear me then, and judge for yourself—You knew well the character of the woman, to whose fate, while I was still a stripling, accident not affection united mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and a miserable life she led you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Jealous without love, profuse without generosity, negligent in her dress, violent in her temper, coarse in her manners, with no virtue but that one which she owed to constitution, not to principle, during three years she rendered my home an hell. My patience was at length exhausted; I made over to her the remnants of an estate which her extravagance had ruined, bade this domestic fiend an eternal farewell, and sailed, under the assumed name of Dorimant, to India.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>I see no harm as yet. Lived with her three years? I wouldn't have lived with her three days—No! not to have buried her on the fourth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Soon after my arrival, it was my chance to save the life of the famous Mortimer, who—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>The Nabob, whose immense wealth—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>The same. This procured me admission to his house, where I saw his daughter: She was lovely, and grateful to me for the preservation of her father's life; opportunities of seeing each other were frequent, and in an unguarded moment—yet heaven can witness to my intentions!—in an unguarded moment I—I was a villain!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p><stage>[shaking his head]</stage>—Little better, I must say!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p><hi>Her</hi> weakness and <hi>my</hi> perfidy were soon discovered. Marry her, I could not; her father's wrath was dreadful; she sought a refuge from it in <hi>my</hi> arms, and fled with me from India.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>From India, and from her father? Young man! Young man! And what says your wife to all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Soon after our separation, I find that she went abroad, nor has she been heard of for near two years either by her banker, or her friends. Report says, that she is dead: If so, my hand is Zorayda's; and in the mean while she resides with my cousin, Lady Clara Modish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Lady Clara? And how the devil came <hi>she</hi> to receive her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>The Devil made her, the great Devil of all! Money, man, darling money! Her Ladyship had been extravagant, and so I paid a gaming debt or two for her: besides this, the appearance of protecting a friendless orphan flatters that oftentatious sensibility, which it is her passion to display on every occasion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>But does she know the history of her protegée?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>I was compelled to trust her with it under a promise of profound secrecy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>And how has she kept her promise?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Why really extremely well, considering she's a woman of fashion. She only confided it to her most intimate friends, who told it again to all their particular acquaintance, who repeated it to every creature they knew; and now the whole Town is informed of the whole transaction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>And you really have the heart to present this poor young creature to the world in a light so despicable?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Spare your reproaches, my dear sir; they have already been made by a very able advocate. You remember Modish's sister, Emily?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Young Ormond's widow?—A charming creature!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>She is interested about Zorayda, and has frequently written to me on this subject. Her remonstrances have carried with them conviction, and I am resolved to wait on her this morning to entreat her protection for Zorayda; and, should she grant it, to engage, cruel as it will be to the feelings of us both, no more to visit my love, till I can offer her my hand and fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>A very good resolution too: I long to see your goddess.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Come then to Lady Clara's, and behold the fictitious charms of modish beauty effaced by the native graces, the enchanting simplicity of my artless, my bewitching Zorayda! But as this is but weak attraction for a satirist, if you still exclaim, "Thou, Folly, art my goddess!" I can promise
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
you some diversion in your own way; for Lady Clara's table is seldom unsupplied with a plentiful banquet of fools.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Every table in town may be supplied with that article at a very small expence, I doubt not; for, after all my peregrinations in quest of folly, I am decided, that no country abounds more with that luxury than little, England; where absurdities spring as kindly as mushrooms upon dunghills, and you can't turn a corner without starting a fool!

Superdescribed, I see, to Miss Mandeville, though she knows well enough that's only a consumed name. Now do tell me, dear Miss, what is your right one? What is your real abomination?</p>

<p>Still at breakfast in her dressing-room. She slept ill, and left her bed late this morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>She was quite in the right: for my part I wonder why people leave their beds at all, for they only contrive to bore themselves and their acquaintance. Now I've some thoughts of going to bed one of these nights, and never getting up again.</p>

<p>Oh! pray, my Lord, put that scheme into execution, for the benefit of your friends as well as yourself.</p>

<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>Oh! it's from a poor relation; 'twill keep.—Beauchamp, were you at Lady Sparkle's last night?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and sound it very fashionable, and very dull.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>Oh! the terms are now synonimous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>Quite; for since every thing that's fashionable is insipid, in mere justice every thing that's insipid must be fashionable!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! Is this really so, my lord?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>Matter of fact, sir, 'pon my soul! Insipidity is now the very criterion of fashion. A man of <hi>ton</hi> should never dance but when he's not wanted, or sing but when nobody wishes to hear him. He should yawn at a comedy, laugh at a tragedy, cry "damn'd bore" at both, tread upon his neighbour's toes, hunt with a tooth-pick in his mouth, see women tumble down stairs without trying to stop them, and, in order to be perfectly fashionable, should make himself completely disagreeable!</p>

Now heaven preserve my hearing! 'tis Miss Chatterall.</p>

<p>I'm glad of it; she always talks scandal, and scandal is the best thing in the world for the nerves.</p>

<p>My dear creature, I'm so charmed to see you! We've not met this age!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Lady Clara! such a dreadful thing has happened to me! I've been so shocked, and so quizzed, and all that!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>You alarm me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>You must know, as I came along, another carriage got entangled with mine. A mob soon collected round us, and out of pure good
<pb n="12" facs="18"/>
nature and condescension, I thought I'd entertain them with a little graceful terror.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>How kind!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Wasn't it?—So, on this, I screamed in the most delightful way imaginable, practised my new Parisot attitudes, and threw myself into my very best convulsions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>And, I warrant, the spectators burst into tears?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>No truly, they burst out a laughing!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<p>Oh, shameful!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Wasn't it?—I declare I was just like Orphy, the old fiddler, playing to the stocks and stones! The more I squalled the more they laughed; and at last they made me so angry that I vowed never to go into fits again, except in the very best company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>And a mighty proper resolution too!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Wasn't it?—But, Modish, what provoked me most was your uncle; that great gawky creature, General Truncheon. He never offered to help me the least bit. And then he ha-ha-hae'd, and he-he-he'd, and all that so, you've no idea!—How shocking! Wasn't it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>Oh! you know my uncle's a blockhead; he's supposed to have the greatest body and least wit of any man in London.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>That follows of course: I've observed, that in lofty houses the upper apartments are always the worst furnished.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Very well, Miss Mandeville; extremely well indeed!—
<stage>[Aside]</stage>
I'll remember that, and sport it for my own.—But, Lord! I must be gone, or Lady Cogwell will be out, and I wouldn't miss seeing her for the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="19"/>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>Lady Cogwell! I thought she was your aversion?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear, so she is; but last night Mrs. Punt, playing with her at whist, found the ace of diamonds hid in her muff; so I'm going to comfort, and console, and vex, and teaze her, and all that, you know. Modish, lead me to my carriage. You won't go with me, Miss Mandeville?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>No; I'm not in a vexing, teazing, and all that humour this morning. But are you sure of the truth of this story?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Sure of it? Why Mrs. Blab-all told it me, and I believe all she says to be gospel, for she has talked scandal to me every morning for this year and an half past, and in all that time never told the least bit of a lye. How kind of her! Wasn't it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>Are you going, Mr. Walsingham? We dine at home; if you can put up with a family dinner—
<stage>[<hi>He bows, and exit with</hi> Beauchamp.]</stage>
—You'll be with me in the evening, Miss Chatterall?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Oh! without fail; and I hope by that time to have collected authentic information concerning two elopements, four young men ruined at play, nine ladies of quality taken tripping with their footmen, and one who died of a cold which she caught in going to church. How comical! Wasn't it? Come, Modish!</p>

<p>I protest I've forgotten, but the porter can tell you. May I ask, why you enquire?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="20"/>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>I've no sort of objection to your asking the question, provided you've none to my not answering it. Good morning; we shall meet at dinner; or perhaps not till to-morrow; or perhaps not this month; it doesn't signify, you know, if we never meet at all.</p>

<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>Oh! not in the least—Good morning.

<p>I see Mr. Modish returning; shall I stay, or leave you to your usual discussions? Perhaps my presence may prevent—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>Oh! child, don't mind me: these little matrimonial rubs are excellent for the vapours, and Modish is never so entertaining as when I've put him out of temper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>I'm sure then he's entertaining very often, but I cannot admire your mode of making him so▪ and for my own part I verily think that were I to live a thousand years, I could never succeed in extracting amusement from my husband's uneasiness, or find pleasure in being the torment of a man, whom I had sworn before the altar to love and to obey!

calling, on Zorayda for those offices which a daughter alone can perform; and woe is me! calling in vain! Perhaps—, perhaps ere this cold in a foreign grave, where his heart has forgot at my name to burn with anger, or to glow with love, where Death has long since forbidden his lips to call on me, or curse me! Yet if he still <hi>should</hi> live....too surely, wretched Zorayda, he lives no longer for thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Zorayda, would you drive me mad?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>And still no letters from India? Still no word from my father, or kind, or cruel? Oh that I could but know he still exists! that I could but once more see the characters of his hand! that I could but for one moment hear his voice, though in the next I again heard it curse me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Nay, be comforted! A person just arrived from India, I trust, can give me some tidings of Mr. Mortimer, and having discharged my errand here, I hasten to him. You mentioned some trinkets which you wished to purchase; these notes will answer their price. And now, my love, farewell for the present: when next we meet, I hope to bring good tidings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Heaven grant it! but to whom go you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>To a poor relation of Modish's, who applied to him for relief.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>And he departed....?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Unrelieved.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Alas! Yet perhaps be was undeserving?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>That I know not; but trust me, Zorayda, I love not those, who weigh too nicely the transgressions of a <hi>sufferer:</hi> to punish human errors is the province of Heaven; to relieve human wants is the duty of man!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="23" facs="29"/>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>True, true, dear Edward! and therefore cannot you....</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>You know, my means are circumscribed; what cash I could have spared, was already appropriated to your use.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>To mine?—these notes?—And whither is he now gone?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>To Mrs. Ormond's, whose noble heart would willingly relieve him, but whose means....</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>And if she cannot—what must he do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Starve, Zorayda!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>He shall not!—no, no, he shall not! Follow him! These notes—take them, take them all: haste to him with them: oh! haste, ere it be too late! Nay, oppose me not, dear Edward; in this I must not be opposed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Oppose you, Zorayda? be my own heart hardened, when I defeat the generosity of yours! I haste with your present to Mrs. Ormond, and at the same time I trust I shall obtain some tidings of Mr. Mortimer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>To Mrs. Ormond? Stay! I will inclose the notes in this letter—
<stage>[sealing it]</stage>
—Give it her; it says—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>What, my love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>—


<stage>[after a pause]</stage>
—What <hi>I</hi> cannot!—Leave me! Nay delay not! Leave me, I conjure you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>I obey!
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>I cannot doubt that letter's effect: Mrs. Ormond will read my sad story with compassion, and stretch forth her hand to save from destruction a poor creature, whose guilt began in ignorance, whose knowledge of that guilt, but for her, must end in despair! She will convince Beauchamp, that 'tis necessary we should part: then will I hasten back to India, hasten to my dear, my cruel
<pb n="24" facs="30"/>
father: will throw me on his bosom, will cling round his knees, will clasp his hand till it dashes me on the ground, and then, if his feet trample me, will bathe them with my tears, kiss them, and die!

<p>Oh! at my first entrance into life, my establishment was not less splendid, but my husband's nature, generous and benevolent to excess, ultimately proved our ruin. He was compelled to part with his estate, and we retired to an humble retreat, where my beloved Ormond expired.</p>

<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>

<p>Is trifling when compared with that of your present!

But never—no, while I have life never will I part with this note! I'll wear it next my heart as a talisman, for you gave it when you could full ill afford it, and gave it too from the noblest of motives, compassion for the distrest, and respect for the memory of a father!</p>

<p><stage>[coldly.]</stage>
Lady Clara, I suppose...</p>

<p>The coxcomb!
<stage>[aside.]</stage>
—My Lord, I must be candid with you. Considering our situations, I know the world will blame me for not accepting your proposals; but could I so easily forget Mr. Ormond's loss, I must frankly own that your Lordship is by no means the man whom I think likely to make me happy in a second marriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>Marriage! my dear creature, who said a word on the subject? Nothing could be farther from my thoughts, for <hi>I</hi> think marriage a great bore: Don't you?—Now, what I meant was that sort of amicable arrangement, which, when we grow tired of each other, (as I doubt not, we soon shall,) may leave both at liberty to pursue our separate inclinations. Thus stands the case: You are poor, I am rich; you are handsome, so am I. Despise then the opinions of prudes and cynics, and sharing a splendid establishment with love and me....
<stage>[yawning.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Beyond a doubt must be perfectly enchanting!—
<stage>[Aside]</stage>
Insolent coxcomb! Yet he's so absurd that anger here would be ridiculous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I thought you'd like the proposal. Nay, I should have flown to you with it upon the wings of love a month ago, if something or other hadn't continually driven it out of my head; and if my valet hadn't put me in mind of it this morning, 'pon my soul I believe I shouldn't have remembered it at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>It were better, my Lord, that you never had, for I cannot hold your insolent offers in greater contempt than I do their proposer. After this declaration you must be convinced that your presence here cannot be acceptable.

<p>Without reason? I doubt it not; I believe no one has much to fear from your Lordship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>I don't understand that sneer, but the immediate enforcement of your bond shall convince you that you, sir, at least have something to fear from me. This will be merely a proper mode of punishing your present conduct, which I cannot but consider as ungrateful in the extreme; and 'pon my soul I should be in a confounded passion, if being angry were not too great an exertion for a man of fashion.

<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Oh! a fit of tears has relieved me; but how can I sufficiently thank you for your interference?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>By accepting without scruple this from Zorayda.
<stage>[Giving a packet.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>And its contents are....</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Hearing that Mr. Rivers meant to apply to you for assistance, and fearing lest your ability to relieve him should not square with your inclination, she readily sacrificed some jewels, which she had long been anxious to possess, and appropriated the money to the alleviation of his distresses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Noble girl! And while such is <hi>her</hi> conduct, how, Colonel Beauchamp, how can you justify your own, either to her or to yourself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Justify it, I cannot. Yet surely circumstances may in some measure extenuate its impropriety. The woman's character, who, for my sins, calls me her husband....</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>That woman, be she what she may; is still your wife, Colonel Beauchamp, nor are her faults any apology for yours. I may pity you for being united to such a woman; but while she exists, I must blame your attachment to any other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Well then, my fair moralist, shew that pity by counselling my future conduct. What should I do!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Can you ask me? Restore Zorayda to virtue and her father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>On one condition you shall be obeyed. A report, which seems well authenticated, has reached me, that many months are past since my wife expired at Turin. For that place I mean instantly to set out, anxious to ascertain the fact;
<pb n="33" facs="39"/>
which, if true, leaves me at liberty to repair my injuries to Zorayda; and if false—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>You will then be guided by me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>There is my hand; on my honour, I will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>I accept then your conditions.—When mean you to set out for Turin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>I am impatient to be gone; yet how to tell Zorayda that I must leave her—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Be that my care.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Dear Mrs. Ormond, would you but undertake that painful task, would you explain to her the object of my journey to Turin, and, should it prove unsuccessful, strive to reconcile her to the cruel alternative—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>All this shall be done, though not exactly by me; situated as I am with Lady Clara, I cannot go myself to her house uninvited; but I think Mr. Rivers may without impropriety, under the pretext of returning to her this now unnecessary present.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>Unnecessary! Have his wants then been already relieved?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>They needed no relief; Rivers is wealthy, and the object of his visit to Lady Clara's this morning was to make an experiment on her heart, not her purse. Zorayda's gift, therefore, being now superfluous, I will persuade Rivers to return it to her himself; and while expressing his gratitude for her well-intended benevolence, he may take an opportunity of convincing her that your absence is necessary, that Lady Clara's is by no means a proper abode for her, and he shall press her, 'till the result of your inquiries shall have determined her future conduct, to accept an asylum in my house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="34" facs="40"/>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>And will you, Mrs. Ormond, will you hazard your reputation, and subject yourself to the world's censure, by affording protection and support to an unfortunate, whose errors—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Hush! hush! No more of this. You accept then my proposal?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BEAU.</speaker>
<p>With transport! But by heaven you are an angel!—Oh, Mrs. Ormond! did all your sex think, like you—would Chastity stretch forth her hand to assist the penitent, not raise it to plunge her deeper—many a poor victim of imprudence now struggling with the billows might easily regain the shore!—But when some unhappy girl has made the first false step, branded with shame, abandoned by her former friends, courted by vice, and shunned by virtue, no wonder that she flies from remorse to the arms of luxury, and purchases a momentary oblivion of her sorrows by a repetition of the fault which caused them.</p>

<div3 n="1" type="scene">
<head><hi>SCENE I.</hi>—</head><stage>An Apartment elegantly furnished.</stage>
<stage>Mrs. ORMOND <hi>and</hi> RIVERS <hi>are seated near a Table, on which is Desert, &amp;c.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
<p>WELL, well, your commission is a delicate one, and I doubt much my executing it to your satisfaction; but however I'll do my best. Beauchamp, you say, is the villain's name, who—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>It is, but guilty as he is in the present instance, justice compels me to say, that by no other act has he ever merited the name of villain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>By my soul, this one is quite sufficient! The married seducer of an unsuspecting girl, the selfish betrayer of a father's confidence! Oh! he's qualified to take the degree of villain in any college of vice throughout the universe!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Thus severe upon Beauchamp, how can Miss Mandeville's errors hope from you that indulgence—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>Surely the case is widely different; besides, her generosity has interested me sincerely in her behalf. This you say is the packet which I am to return to her?—Mandeville?—Mandeville?—I don't recollect any person of that name in India; but no matter: Whoever her father may be, if he really loves his daughter, heartily shall I rejoice to relieve the poor man from suffering, what I once felt so keenly myself!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Yourself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="36" facs="42"/>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>Emily, it was my misfortune to have a daughter on whom my soul doated. Her mother died while my child was yet an infant, and my child was the image of that mother, was the delight of my eye, was the comfort of my heart, was the solitary blessing of my existence; and while that one blessing was mine, I thought I possessed every other! This daughter, this very idolized daughter, sacrificed to passion <hi>her</hi> honour and <hi>my</hi> love, abandoned me for a villain, and her father became childless!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Is she then dead?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>To me for ever! She fled from India, doubtless with the perfidious Dorimant; and what has since become of her, I know not. But be she where she may, the ungrateful is no more my daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Yet were she now stretched in penitence at your feet—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>Stretched in her coffin I might forgive her, else never!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Mr. Rivers—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>Nay, speak of her no more. I have sworn never to pardon her; that oath will I keep religiously, and seek that happiness, my dear cousin, in <hi>your</hi> family, which the ungrateful fugitive has banished for ever from my own!
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Either Mr. Rivers deceives himself, or the difference must be strange between a father's and a mother's feelings! Yes, my loved William, should'st <hi>thou</hi> prove unworthy my regard, I think my heart would break with grief; but till it <hi>did</hi> break, never, oh! surely never, would it feel one spark of less affection for thee!</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Lord LISTLESS <hi>and</hi> MODISH.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>A peer and a man of fashion lend money? Mad! Positively mad, dear Modish, or such an idea could never have entered your head!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>Is it so strange, then, to expect assistance from a brother?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>No, but uncommonly strange to expect money from a man of fashion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>Absurd, when the largeness of your income—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>Is absolutely necessary for the largeness of my expenditure. 'Pon my soul, my dear fellow, I could almost imagine, that you have quite forgotten how absolutely necessary it is for a man in my situation to keep up a certain style; to have horses he never rides, houses he never inhabits, and mistresses he scarcely knows by sight. In short, these unnecessary necessities are so innumerable, that I'm myself much straitened in my circumstances, and mean to insist immediately upon the payment of Beauchamp's bond.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>How, Lord Listless! That bond, which it is well known your father never intended to—But this is foreign to the subject. Will you oblige me with the sum I mentioned?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>I can't, 'pon my soul!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>Say rather, you <hi>won't</hi>; I shall be better pleased.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>Shall you?—Then I won't, 'pon my soul!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>I've done. If you can justify to yourself
<pb n="38" facs="44"/>
this conduct towards so near a relation as Lady Clara, and a man whom you called your friend—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>Friends? Relations? Ridiculous! My dear Modish, you surely forget that I'm a citizen of the world, an universal philanthropist. The poor are <hi>my</hi> relations, the unfortunate are <hi>my</hi> friends; and as to my natural friends and relations, I don't care that for them all put together, 'pon my soul!—

<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>Contemptible!—Yet how dare I arraign his conduct, when I remember how little did compassion sway my own this morning to poor Rivers!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>JOHN.</speaker>
<p>Here's a sad job, sir! The porter has let in the old usurer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Who? The usurer? What, Squeez'em?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>JOHN.</speaker>
<p>The same, sir.</p>

<p>The Devil!—Yet I dare not refuse to see him.—Show him up.—

—No doubt he comes for money, but I must endeavour to beat him off as civilly as I can.</p>
</sp>
<stage>JOHN <hi>introduces</hi> SQUEEZ'EM.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>Good God, is it you, my dear Mr. Squeez'em? I'm charmed beyond measure to see you! Why, you look charmingly, charmingly I protest!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>You're mighty good to say so, sir. I made-bold to call—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>I'm extremely glad you did, for I was just wondering why I hadn't seen you for so long; and why don't you call oftener? I'm happy at all times to see my best friend, Mr. Squeez'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="39" facs="45"/>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>I am much flattered by your kindness, sir—There is a—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>I beg you'll be seated. John, a chair for Mr. Squeez'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>It's quite unnecessary, for I only—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>I must insist upon it. My good friend, sit yourself down, I entreat you.—
<stage>[They sit.]</stage>
—And now tell me, how are your children? All well, I hope? No meazles? No hooping-cough? No—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>None, sir, none, I thank you; but there is a little—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>A little one coming is there? I beg I may stand god-father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>Lord! sir, you mistake; I'd only—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>Why, isn't dear Mrs. Squeez'em likely to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>Dear Mrs. Squeez'em has nothing at all to do with what I'm come about. To be plain with you, Mr. Modish, there is a little affair, which—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>A little affair? Oh! you sly rogue! What, which must be a secret between you and me? Well, well, I promise you, Mrs. Squeez'em sha'nt hear a word of it. And so the little girl is pretty, is she?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>Lord, sir, I can't get you to hear me out; and I've walked here all the way from St. Mary Axe on purpose to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>Walked here? What, all that way? Then pray take some refreshment, for I'm sure you must be fatigued. Here John, tea, coffee—or perhaps you'd prefer a glass of wine? Only say what you like, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>Dear sir, there's nothing I should like so much at present as to have you listen to what I want to say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="40" facs="46"/>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>Surely, surely; you won't take any refreshment then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>None, I thank you, sir; I'm in a hurry to return home, and only wish to ask—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>In an hurry to return home? Then for Heaven's sake don't let me detain you.—Here, John, light Mr. Squeez'em down stairs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I only want to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>To get home, I know it. Good night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>I should be glad to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>To go; pray suit your own convenience, but I'm greatly obliged to you for this call. Chatting away an hour with a friend like you is so amusing!—Open the door, John.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SQUEEZ.</speaker>
<p>If you'd only be so good as to pay—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>My respects to Mrs. Squeez'em; I shall take the first opportunity, and bring lady Clara with me, till when, adieu, my dear Mr. Squeez'em; consider me as your fast friend, and be assured, that I shall always be delighted to serve you to the very utmost extent of my ability.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>MOD.</speaker>
<p>So! He's gone, and now I can breathe again; but I must rejoin my company, lest the cause of my absence should be suspected. With a mind thus ill at ease how tormenting is it to assume the appearance of content, and mingle in the irksome gaiety of the happy and unthinking.

<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Lord, Mr. Walsingham!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Lord, Miss Chatterall!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>I've got such a story to tell you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>"A story to tell?"—I dare say you have.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Do you know Miss Bloomly?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Only by character.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Then you know the worst of her, for her character's monstrous shocking, that's the truth on't. But would you believe it, she's crooked! How comical, an't it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Crooked? Impossible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Oh! but I assure you it's true, for her most intimate friend told me so just now with her own mouth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Her friend!—A pretty sort of a friend, by my honour! Before I'd have such friends—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Nay but, Mr. Walsingham, there was no harm in telling it to <hi>me,</hi> for she knew very well it would go no further.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Did she? Then I pronounce her a most learned lady, for she knows what no other person in London does, man, woman, or child.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Well, but now don't repeat this story I beg, for nobody else knows it; and I only mean to tell it to Lady Clara, and a few particular friends, under a profound promise of secrecy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>There you are quite right, for whenever you wish a malicious report to circulate, you should always relate it as an inviolable secret.—People of fashion hear so much scandal daily, that one's own particular lye is frequently huddled in the crowd, and perhaps totally forgotten; but tell a fine lady a scandalous anecdote under a promise of secrecy,
<pb n="42" facs="48"/>
and I'll be bound that she pops it out within five minutes after.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>I declare now, he doesn't believe a word of it, and that's monstrous provoking! However, I hope it will still serve to break, off Miss Bloomly's marriage with young Flash. Well I protest I can't conceive how it is that every body contrives to get married except myself! I'm sure I do all in my power; grudge no expence in fans, feathers, cold cream, pearl powder, and bloom of oriental lilies; and it was but last week that I paid the Lord knows what for a new pair of the very best arched eye-brows!—Yet all won't do, and I'm sure it's—it's <hi>curst</hi> provoking, so it is!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ZORAYDA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Miss Mandeville, do you know—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Alas! Yes, Miss Chatterall, I know it but too well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Do you? Oh! Gemini! who could have told you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>The town talks of nothing else: at first indeed I wouldn't believe the story; but the redness of your eyes proves it to be but too well-founded.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>My eyes?—Dear, what can you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>I'm sure I pity you sincerely, but how <hi>could</hi> you be so imprudent? How could you think of going in your own carriage to the place where your little boys are nursed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>My little boys?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Nay, it's too late to pretend ignorance; I know the story but too well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="43" facs="49"/>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Do you? Then pray let me know it too; for let me die if this isn't the first word I ever heard of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR</speaker>
<p>Nay, this is carrying the jest too far, since every body knows you were married in St. Martin's Church to a Serjeant of the Guards, of the name of Brazen, on the 17th of last June, at seven and thirty minutes past eleven, odd seconds; and that you have at this moment too fine little boys at nurse with Mrs. Mum, No. 9, Paradise Row, three doors from the Red Lamps and Green Railing. Why, dear me, every body knows it as well as I do!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Mercy! What, <hi>I</hi> marry a Serjeant in the Guards! <hi>I</hi> have fine little boys! <hi>I</hi> visit a vulgar Mrs. Mum! Oh! horrid! Oh! monstrous!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Really, Mrs. Brazen—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Don't call me Mrs. Brazen! I won't be called Mrs. Brazen!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Nay, 'tis a disagreeable situation, I own, and I declare I pity you extremely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Don't pity me, Miss! I won't bear to be pitied! There's not a syllable of truth in the story, and I'm surprised you could believe such a thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Oh! but I had it from your friend Mrs. Blab-all, and she, you know—"has talked scandal to you for this year and an half past, and never told you the least bit of a lye in all that time!"—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Blab-all? A malicious creature! But I always thought her a very bad woman! I'll go this moment and tell her—But even if this story <hi>were</hi> true, I don't understand, Miss, why you should talk to me about it of all people in the world!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="44" facs="50"/>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Dear! I thought talking over the subject would console you! Did not you go this morning to Lady Cogwell, on purpose to talk over the story of her cheating?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but I did <hi>that</hi> merely to teaze her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Did you? Then I vow and protest, that's the very reason why <hi>I</hi> did <hi>this.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Indeed? Then let me tell you, Miss—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Come, Miss Chatterall, even make yourself easy. After all this story of the footman is simply an experiment of mine, intended to ascertain how you would bear being the heroine of such an anecdote, as I have frequently heard you relate of others; and I trust it will convince you, that murdering characters is not an amusement quite so harmless as you and your acquaintance seem to think it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Very well, Miss! Very well! But since you think proper to take such liberties with—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, either be calm, or excuse my leaving you, since if the storm must rage, I prefer infinitely hearing it at a distance.</p>

<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>[<stage><hi>advancing, and looking at him through her glass.</hi>]</stage>
—Um! a stranger!—And really a personable man.—I'll accost him.—If you wish, sir, to see Lady Clara—</p>

<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>No, madam; my business is with you. My name is Rivers, and I come here authorized by Colonel Beauchamp to converse with you on a very delicate subject.—
<stage>[Aside]</stage>
—Well, hang me if I see an atom of the youth and beauty which Mrs. Ormond praised so highly!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>By Beauchamp, did you say, sir? By Colonel Beauchamp?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>You seem surprised, madam; but suffer me to say, that Beauchamp's attachment to you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Attachment to me? I'm sure, if he ever had any, he kept it a profound secret.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>Ah! madam, you flatter yourself! In spite of his precautions, that secret is now so well known, that things can no longer remain as they are, and some change in your situation ought to take place as soon as possible. I trust, madam, you are of my opinion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="46" facs="52"/>

<p>Why really, sir....to say the truth....I can't deny that I <hi>am</hi> rather of your way of thinking. But as Col. Beauchamp has a wife...</p>

<p>Lord, sir! Dear sir!—

Thank heaven then I <hi>shall</hi> be married after all!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p><stage>[sighing.]</stage>
—Then, sir, there's an end of the whole business!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>True, madam, and I rejoice that you feel the necessity: It relieves me from the most embarrassing part of my commission, and emboldens me to say, without further ceremony, that in case of your not marrying Beauchamp, all your friends think it right that you should set off immediately for India.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>For India!—Lord, sir, what should I do there? Why must I needs be packed off to India, because I can't marry Colonel Beauchamp?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>My dear madam, 'tis absolutely necessary, and till you set sail, Mrs. Ormond requests you to accept an asylum in her house. At first indeed she had some scruples at engaging in an affair so delicate; but as she is confident that Col. Beauchamp is the only person who has ever been particular to you....</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p><stage>[tossing her head.]</stage>
—Indeed, Sir? Upon my word then she's very much mistaken. A
<pb n="47" facs="53"/>
great many people have been much more particular than Colonel Beauchamp, I can assure her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>How! a great many?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir: Fifty at least.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! madam, fifty?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Bless me, sir, what is there so strange in that? Why if I don't marry for a year, I dare say there'll be fifty more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>The devil, there will!—Then, madam, your going to India—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>I'd as soon go to the moon, sir!—What, leave London, dear London, and the gay world, the dear gay world! The very thought on't is quite odious and execrable, and all that sir, an't it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>MISS Mandeville's manners coarse, and her person disagreeable?</p>

<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Yet perhaps her neglect of you...</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>I guess what you would say, my good Emily. A moment of ill humour, a dish of tea too strong, a bad run of luck last night, the indisposition of her lap-dog, or any other fine-lady-like affliction, might occasion her indifference to <hi>my</hi> distress—but that she could see the infant graces of your child without interest, that she could suffer without compassion an heart like yours to languish in poverty, betrays an insensibility which I never can forgive.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>You must though, my dear sir, or your heart is composed of tougher materials than I imagine. Yes, yes, Rivers and my brother must be friends, and probably that brings Lady Clara hither.—So, here she comes!</p>

<p>My dear Mrs. Ormond, I've just hurried hither for one instant!—Why, they tell me you've been indisposed. You look charmingly, however: But, you cruel creature, why did not you let me know you were ill?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Knowing your exquisite sensibility, Lady Clara, surely it had been barbarous in me to torture your nerves by a recital of my sufferings.</p>

<p>Oh! fye, fye! when the delicate attentions of friendship can alleviate....I protest, Mrs. Ormond, you've got a mighty pretty house here.</p>

<stage>Mrs. ORM.</stage>
<p>Tolerable. Mr. Rivers insisted upon my removing hither immediately, and therefore things are not quite....</p>

<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Rivers! Dear, that puts me in mind—I want to talk to you about him. Do

you know, he put the drollest trick upon me this morning!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p><stage>[archly.]</stage>
So he did upon me; but you were too cunning for him: I, poor innocent, was completely the dupe of his feigned distresses; but upon you, he tells me, they made not the slightest impression.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! no more they did—Ha, ha, ha!—

Spiteful thing, how I hate her!—But, my dear Mrs. Ormond, you...you relieved him then....</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Oh! the relief in <hi>my</hi> power to afford him was very moderate; and in truth our exchange of presents bore no proportion to one another. I had nothing to bestow on him but a very trifle and a dish of tea, and he repaid me with notes of not less than a thousand pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>Mercy on me! a thousand pounds for a dish of tea? How unlucky it was that I had just sent away the chocolate<note n="*" place="foot">This <hi>trait</hi> is borrowed from <hi>Mercier's</hi> "Habitant de la Guadaloupe."</note>!</p>

<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>I am afraid he takes the affair a little more seriously.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>But surely, my dear creature, you can explain to him....</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Believe me, Lady Clara, however great may be my cause of complaint, my brother's interest will never cease to be mine; and
<pb n="56" facs="62"/>
if my interference can possibly produce a reconciliation....</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>You will use it? Let me die now if that isn't being extremely kind; but indeed I always said you had one of the best hearts in the world. And suppose now, to lose no time, you were to bring Mr. Rivers to my house tonight?</p>

<p>To-night? Why really....my mourning....</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Oh! as to your mourning, you know you'll be considered as at home; for, is not my house, is not every thing I possess, as much yours as my own?</p>

<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>You're too kind, Lady Clara; indeed you're too kind!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>Not at all! oh dear, not at all! I shall expect you then, and pray bring Mr. Rivers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>I'll do my best; but in truth I doubt my being able to prevail on him, unless you can make use of Falstaff's excuse, and protest solemnly that you knew him all the while: however, if he should not come, depend upon it's not being a fault of mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>Well now, that's a dear creature; and I hope to Heaven you may suceeed! Yet should your endeavours to appease Mr. Rivers prove fruitless, I shall console myself with the reflection that at least my dear sister enjoys those advantages of which, by imprudence, I have deprived myself.—

<p>Even so. Lady Clara's errand was to express her contrition for this morning's adventure with all possible humility, and request your presence at her house to-night for the express purpose of receiving her husband's apologies and her own.</p>

<p>No, only for dispersing them, and my talisman consists in pronouncing that single cabalistical word "Distress;" away they go; for in fact, my dear Emily, a fashionable friend is an absolute bird of passage,—</p>

<p>Entice her!—then she's not appris'd of the honour intended her by your lordship?</p>

<p>Zounds! my lord, but that makes the joke a great deal better!—And could you possibly doubt my assisting so honourable a design?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord LIST.</speaker>
<p>Why, to tell you the truth, (but remember your promise of secrecy) the lady is no other than Miss Mandeville; and as you are Beauchamp's friend—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WAL.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! what does that signify?—Isn't he a commoner, an't you a peer? Isn't he poor, an't you rich? Isn't he an old friend, an't you a new acquaintance? And can you doubt which of the two I should prefer serving?—My dear lord, pray judge a little more of me by yourself!</p>

<p>Oh dear! My dear, as to that, <hi>I</hi> shall visit Lady Clara no more at any rate, unless indeed she gives a masquerade; and then you know nobody need know whether one visits her or not.—But accept a favour from her bare-faced!—Lord, my love, I blush at the very thought!

<speaker>Mrs. BLAB.</speaker>
<p>Oh Lord! yes my dear to be sure I do; well, my love, and so—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss. CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Well, and so, my life, my Lord was so severe in his observations, that at length Beauchamp got into a terrible rage, rapped out three great oaths that he'd be the death of him, seized a blunderbuss (which happened to be upon the breakfast table) shot his lordship through the body, and the Colonel and his enamorata immediately made off for France, with the intention of offering their services to the triumvirate. How odd! an't it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. BLAB.</speaker>
<p>Odd indeed!—But lord! my life, how unlucky it was that Mrs. Ormond should happen to have a blunderbuss lying on her breakfast table?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss CHAT.</speaker>
<p>Extremely unlucky indeed, my dear. But come let us in, and if Miss Mandeville shews her face to night, I shall tell Lady Clara what I think of her very plainly! for after all, my dear, to own a truth, the greatest advantage I ever could find in walking straight myself in the path of virtue, was the privilege of insulting those who step a little on one side.

Fudge!—And now Emily, what dismal tale have you to relate?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>One, my dear sir, which interests me nearly. Soon after your leaving me this morning, I owed my rescue from the grossest impertinence to an officer, who unluckily was indebted for a large sum to the coxcomb by whom I was insulted. This note informs me, that, in consequence of having afforded me his protection, he has been arrested, and is now confined at the suit of Lord Listless.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>Confined? He shall not be so long. England needs such men, nor shall she be deprived of them, while <hi>I</hi> can help it.—What does your friend owe?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Not less than 3000l.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>A large sum! But no matter! Set your heart at rest, Emily; the debt shall be discharged.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>My dear sir!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>Psha! dear nonsense! And his name?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>You will be surprised to hear, that my friend is no other than Colonel Beauchamp.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p><stage>[starting.]</stage>
Beauchamp!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Even he; and his conduct to me this morning must convince you, that, if he has faults, he is not without virtues—but I hasten with these good tidings to Miss Mandeville.—Oh Mr. Rivers! believe me I feel well, how trifling a gift is the wealth which you heap upon me, compared
<pb n="74" facs="80"/>
to the advantages which my son will reap from your acquaintance; much from your precepts, but more from your example.
<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p><stage>[<hi>solus.</hi>]</stage>
My embarrassments increase every hour—Why, why must Beauchamp have faults to none but me?—What course shall I pursue?—Suppose—Yes! I'll discharge his debts under a feigned name, and, when he's at liberty, challenge him in my own; the first to reward his merits, the second to avenge <hi>my</hi> wrongs! It shall be so—and if I fall to-morrow—then may my poor Zorayda find Heaven more merciful than she found her father!—May God forgive her, but I never can!

<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>NAY, sweet Zorayda, why this despair? Probably ere this, the cause of yoor distress has ceased, and Beauchamp is at liberty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Calm your spirits, dearest girl! Believe me this excess of grief is childish, when every thing bids you hope—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Hope!—Mine is fled for ever!—My father, madam, my father!—I planted his path with thorns; I should have strewn it with roses:—he warmed me in his bosom; the snake stung him to the heart:—he loved me; I abandoned him:—he cursed me, and I dare not hope!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Oh blush, Zorayda! when thus sinking beneath misfortune—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Not beneath misfortune; 'tis beneath the burthen of my faults I sink. Oh! well may innocence see the lightning flash without alarm; well may virtue lift her head undaunted above the billows.—But when with sufferings comes the consciousness of their being deserved, oh they are insupportable, and I faint beneath the weight of mine!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>Dear, unhappy girl!—Would to

Heaven Rivers were returned!—Pray, Lady Clara, did Zorayda see him this morning?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady CLARA.</speaker>
<p>No: I have since heard that by some unaccountable mistake he was conducted to Miss Chatterall instead of her.</p>

<p>Miss Chatterall? Oh! then the case is clear. Know then, my Zorayda—

Oh! I fear!—I fear!—</p>

<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>But Beauchamp—</p>

<p>As soon as I have learnt the result of Rivers's visit, I will hasten to let you know it.</p>

<p>So that business is done—There, Emily, set your heart at rest; your champion is free.—But hey! the deuce! you seem if possible still more disturbed than when I left you!—I hope you've not met with more impertinent peers and generous protectors?</p>

<p>What! Beauchamp again?</p>
</sp>

<p>No, the business now regards Beauchamp's mistress; but I find you've made a terrible mistake.—The lady you saw here this evening was a woman of the very strictest virtue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! what a blunder! Why the poor

creature must have thought me mad, for I proposed packing her off to India without ceremony. But where then is the real Miss Mandeville? Does she not reside with Lady Clara?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>She does, and you may now, my dear sir, execute the plan which—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Nay, I've blundered in the outset of it so confoundedly, that I wish some other person—</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. ORM.</speaker>
<p>True—but your consequence—your Indian connections—In short, see her; talk to her; advise her:—Shew her the impropriety of continuing with Beauchamp, paint to her what her father must suffer at her absence, and comfort her with the hope of obtaining his pardon:—But be gentle with her, I intreat you; moderate your naturally impetuous temper; and beware not to heap fresh anguish on an heart, whose wounds are already deep—whose sufferings are already exquisite!</p>

I...I...presume, Miss Mandeville, you are aware how delicate a task Mrs. Ormond has imposed on me.
<stage>[Zorayda bows.]</stage>
So delicate, in truth, that no sentiment could induce my undertaking it less strong than gratitude for your generous intentions towards myself, and the interest which Emily's account of you at first inspired me with, and which your own appearance could not fail to increase.</p>

know full well how light these considerations weigh against love when a young hand holds the balance. 'Twas your heart which led you astray; to your heart then will I make my appeal; and, if it be not marble, I shall not make my appeal in vain. Miss Mandeville, I will speak of your father—will explain how heavy is a father's curse—will paint how dreadful is a father's anguish!—Well can I describe that anguish! I have felt it, feel it still!

<p>Your's it was ever; and surely, had I loved you less, I had been appeased more easily. Many a pang, my child, has your absence cost me; but the pleasure of this moment overpays them all. Sweet, oh! sweet are a father's tears shed on the bosom of a repentant child. Hear this, ye flinty-hearted—hear it, and pardon!—Yet how is this? when every other face wears a smile, why hangs a cloud on the brow of my Zorayda?</p>

<speaker>ZOR.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my father! 'tis a cloud which must never be removed; for, 'tis the gloom of self-reproach!—I have erred, and been forgiven; but am I therefore less culpable?—Your indulgence has been great; but is my fault therefore less enormous? Oh, no, no, no! The calm of innocence has for ever left me, the courage of conscious virtue must be mine no more! Still must the memory of errors past torment me, and embitter every future joy:—still must I blush to read scorn in the world's eye, suspicion in my husband's:—and still must feel this painful truth most keenly, that she who once deviates from the paths of virtue, though she may obtain the forgiveness of others, never can obtain her own!</p>

<l>Stare not, fair dames, nor criticize my dress;</l>
<l>You see before you jolly old Queen Bess,</l>
<l>Who from the land of roasting, boiling, stewing,</l>
<l>Is come to see what you above are doing!</l>
<l>Below, where some slight peccadilloes sent me,</l>
<l>Long did a wish, a foolish wish torment me,</l>
<l>For some few days in Britain to revive,</l>
<l>And view that land once more, I lov'd so well alive:—</l>
<l>This wish so teas'd me, morn, night, noon, and eve,</l>
<l>That I resolv'd to ask old Pluto's leave;</l>
