<p>IF I take the Liberty, once more, to crave the Protection of your ROYAL HIGHNESS, for another Tragedy of my writing, it is because I am led, almost unavoidably, to it, by my Subject. In the Character of ELEONORA I have endeavoured to represent, however faintly, a PRINCESS distinguish'd for all the Virtues that render Greatness

amiable. I have aimed, particularly, to do justice to her inviolable Affection and generous Tenderness for a PRINCE, who was the Darling of a great and free People.</p>
<p>Their Descendants, even now, will own, with Pleasure, how properly this Address is made to your ROYAL HIGHNESS. I am, with the profoundest Respect,</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>By a FRIEND.</byline>
<lg>
<l>IN former Times, when fierce religious Rage,</l>
<l>And priestly Sway deform'd each suffering Age,</l>
<l>All manly Wit, all useful Learning lay</l>
<l>In Darkness lost, nor hop'd returning Day.</l>
<l>Religion then was stain'd by cruel Deeds:</l>
<l>And free-born Reason stoop'd to Craft and Creeds.</l>
<l>But happier We!—And tho' to-night we show</l>
<l>What fatal Ills from blind Devotion flow,</l>
<l>'Tis not that we such Rage renew'd can fear,</l>
<l>Or dread the Hand of Persecution here—</l>
<l>Our Scene would wide Humanity impart;</l>
<l>Would breathe extensive Candour thro' the Heart;</l>
<l>Show true Religion even to Error kind,</l>
<l>And claim the perfect Freedom of the Mind.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>If too the Poet paints a noble Strife</l>
<l>'Twixt the fond Husband and the generous Wife;</l>
<l>If all the Father in <hi>his</hi> Voice complains,</l>
<l>And all the Mother in <hi>her</hi> tender Strains;</l>
<l>If these best Passions prompt the pleasing Woe,</l>
<l>Indulge it freely—Nature bids it flow:</l>
<l>Where Parent Nature leads, you cannot stray;</l>
<l>And what she wills, 'tis Virtue to obey.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Fond of <hi>BRITANNIA</hi>'s Fame, and just to <hi>YOU,</hi></l>
<l>He bids <hi>old English Honour</hi> live anew,</l>
<l>And calls your great first <hi>EDWARD</hi> up to view.</l>
<l>But if his Line too weak, his Stroke too faint,</l>
<l>The graceful Figure, in full Light, to paint;</l>
<l>In candid part his honest Meaning take,</l>
<l>And spare the Poet for the Hero's sake.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>By a FRIEND.</byline>
<lg>
<l>THese Poets are such Fools!—The Man behind,</l>
<l>Who wrote this Play—a simple Soul, I find,—</l>
<l>Believes, with all his Heart, there was a Wife,</l>
<l>Who needs would die—to save a Husband's Life!</l>
<l>He in the printed Chronicles has read it:</l>
<l>And true it is—Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> said it.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Why what an Ass these Books do make a Man?</l>
<l>Read Nature—then believe it—you who can.</l>
<l>Look round this Town—the question is not—whether</l>
<l>Spouse <hi>dies</hi> for Spouse: but who will <hi>live</hi> together?</l>
<l>Of old, they say, a Husband was a Lover:</l>
<l>But, thank our Stars! these foolish Days are over:</l>
<l>To such substantial Prudence are we come,</l>
<l>We wed not Heart to Heart—but Plumb to Plumb.</l>
<l>What Sense? what Beauty? are not now the Things:</l>
<l>But can <hi>he</hi> settle—<hi>up</hi> to what <hi>she</hi> brings?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet in this easy, all-forgiving Age,</l>
<l>Bear with such moral Fooleries—on the Stage.</l>
<l>Perhaps too, there may be some gentle Soul,</l>
<l>Who rather likes to weep—than win a Vole;</l>
<l>Who thinks that there <hi>are</hi> Charms in generous Love,</l>
<l>And would to <hi>Edward Eleonora</hi> prove.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>I Will no longer doubt. 'Tis plain, my Friends,</l>
<l>That with our little Band of <hi>English</hi> Troops,</l>
<l>By all Allies all western Powers deserted,</l>
<l>All but the noble Knights that guard this Land,</l>
<l>The Flower of <hi>Europe</hi> and of Christian Valour,</l>
<l>Nought can be done, nought worthy of our Cause,</l>
<l>Worthy of <hi>England</hi>'s Heir, and of the Name</l>
<l>Of <hi>Lion-hearted</hi> RICHARD; whose Renown,</l>
<l>After almost a Century elaps'd,</l>
<l>Shakes thro' its wide Extent this Eastern World.</l>
<l>What else could bend the <hi>Saracen</hi> to Peace,</l>
<l>Who might, with better Policy, refuse</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="9"/>
To grant it us? Yes, to the Prince of <hi>Jaffa</hi></l>
<l>I will accord the Peace he has demanded:</l>
<l>And tho' my Troops, impatient, wait the Signal</l>
<l>To storm yon Walls, yet will I not expose,</l>
<l>In vain Attempts, Valour that should be sav'd</l>
<l>For better days, and for the public Welfare.</l>
<l>Rash fruitless War, from wanton Glory wag'd,</l>
<l>Is only splendid Murder—What says THEALD?</l>
<l>Approves my Reverend Father of my Purpose?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>EDWARD, illustrious Heir of <hi>England</hi>'s Crown,</l>
<l>I must indeed be blinded with the Zeal</l>
<l>Of this our holy Cause, to think your Arms,</l>
<l>Thus all-forsaken, thus betray'd, sufficient</l>
<l>To reach the Grandeur of your first Design,</l>
<l>And, from the Yoke of Infidels, to free</l>
<l>The sacred City, Object of our Vows.</l>
<l>Yet this, methinks, this <hi>Jaffa</hi> might be seiz'd:</l>
<l>That still were something, an auspicious Omen</l>
<l>Of future Conquest—But, unskill'd in War,</l>
<l>To you, my Lord, and GLOSTER'S wise Experience,</l>
<l>I this submit.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Speak, GLOSTER, your Advice,</l>
<l>Before I fix my latest Resolution.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GLOSTER.</speaker>
<l>You know, my Lord, I never was a Friend</l>
<l>To this Crusado. My unchang'd Advice</l>
<l>Is strenuous then for Peace. Nor this, alone,</l>
<l>From your deserted Circumstance I urge,</l>
<l>But from the state of our unhappy Country.</l>
<l>Behold her, EDWARD, with a filial Eye,</l>
<l>And say, is this a time for these Adventures?</l>
<l>Behold Her still with deep Commotion shook,</l>
<l>Beneath a false delusive Face of Quiet:</l>
<l>Behold Her bleeding still from Civil War,</l>
<l>Exhausted, sunk; drain'd by ten thousand Arts</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="10"/>
Of ministerial Rapine, endless Taxes,</l>
<l>Ill-manag'd Expeditions, Strangers, Legates,</l>
<l><hi>Italian</hi> Leeches, and insatiate <hi>Rome</hi>;</l>
<l>That never rag'd before with such gross Insult,</l>
<l>With such abandon'd Avarice. Besides,</l>
<l>Who knows what evil Counsellors, again,</l>
<l>Are gather'd round the Throne. In Times like these,</l>
<l>Disturb'd, and lowring with unsettled Freedom,</l>
<l>One step to lawless Power, one old Attempt</l>
<l>Renew'd, the least Infringement of our Charters,</l>
<l>Would hurl the giddy Nation into Tempest.</l>
<l>Return, my Prince. You have already sav'd</l>
<l>Your Father from his Foes, from haughty LEISTER:</l>
<l>Now save him from his Ministers, from those</l>
<l>Who hold him captive in the worst of Chains—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>You, GLOSTER, sav'd us both.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GLOSTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>I did my Duty;</l>
<l>Even while I join'd with LEISTER, did my Duty—</l>
<l>I hope I did—He, who contends for Freedom,</l>
<l>Can ne'er be justly deem'd his Sovereign's Foe:</l>
<l>No, 'tis the Wretch that tempts him to subvert it,</l>
<l>The soothing Slave, the Traitor in the bosom,</l>
<l>Who best deserves that Name; he is the Worm</l>
<l>That eats out all the Happiness of Kingdoms.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>EDWARD, return; lose not a Day, an Hour,</l>
<l>Before this City. Tho' your Cause be holy,</l>
<l>Believe me, 'tis a much more pious Office,</l>
<l>To save your Father's old and broken Years,</l>
<l>His mild and easy Temper, from the Snares</l>
<l>Of low corrupt insinuating Traitors:</l>
<l>A nobler Office far! on the firm Base</l>
<l>Of well-proportion'd Liberty, to build</l>
<l>The common Quiet, Happiness and Glory,</l>
<l>Of King and People, <hi>England</hi>'s rising Grandeur.</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="11"/>
To you, my Prince, this Task, of right, belongs.</l>
<l>Has not the Royal Heir a juster Claim</l>
<l>To share his Father's inmost Heart and Counsels,</l>
<l>Than Aliens to his Int'rest, those, who make</l>
<l>A Property, a Market of his Honour?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>One Reason more allow me to suggest</l>
<l>For Peace, immediate Peace—should blind Misfortune,</l>
<l>In this far-distant hostile Land, oppress us;</l>
<l>A Chance to which our Weakness stands expos'd:</l>
<l>What, EDWARD, of thy Princess would become,</l>
<l>Thy ELEONORA; she, whose tender Love</l>
<l>Thro' stormy Seas, and in fierce Camps, attends thee?</l>
<l>What of thy blooming Offspring? charg'd with these,</l>
<l>To give our Courage scope were cruel Rashness.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Enough, my Lord, I stand resolv'd on Peace;</l>
<l>And will to <hi>England</hi> strait—But where, alas,</l>
<l>Where shall we cover our inglorious Heads;</l>
<l>When gay with Hope the People round us press,</l>
<l>To hear by what Exploits we have sustain'd</l>
<l>The Fame of RICHARD, and of <hi>English</hi> Valour?</l>
<l>Shall I, my generous Country, I be rank'd</l>
<l>With those weak Princes, who consume thy Wealth,</l>
<l>And sink thy Name in idle Expeditions?—</l>
<l>Perfidious <hi>France!</hi> Be this the ruling Point</l>
<l>Of my whole Life, the Passion of my Soul,</l>
<l>To humble thee, proud Nation!—Meantime, GLOSTER,</l>
<l>See that the captive Princess be restor'd,</l>

<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>Whatever Woes, of late, have clouded <hi>England</hi>;</l>
<l>Yet must I, GLOSTER, call that Nation happy,</l>
<l>On whose Horizon smiles a dawning Prince</l>
<l>Of EDWARD'S Worth and Virtues.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GLOSTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>True, my Friend;</l>
<l>EDWARD has great, has amiable Virtues,</l>
<l>That Virtue chiefly which befits a Prince:</l>
<l>He loves the People he must one day rule;</l>
<l>With Fondness loves them, with a noble Pride;</l>
<l>Esteems their Good, esteems their Glory his.</l>
<l>One Instance it becomes me to recount,</l>
<l>That shows the genuine Greatness of his Soul.</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="13"/>
Tho' I have met him in the bloody Field,</l>
<l>He fighting for his Father, I for Freedom;</l>
<l>Yet bears his Bosom no remaining Grudge</l>
<l>Of those distracted Times: to me his Heart</l>
<l>Is greatly reconcil'd—Virtue! beyond</l>
<l>The little unforgiving Soul of Tyrants!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now will I tell thee, THEALD, whence I stoop</l>
<l>To wear the gaudy Chains of Court-Attendance,</l>
<l>At these grey Years; that should in calm Retirement</l>
<l>Pass the soft Evening of a bustling Life,</l>
<l>And plume my parting Soul for better Worlds.</l>
<l>Amidst his many Virtues, youthful EDWARD</l>
<l>Is lofty, warm, and absolute of Temper:</l>
<l>I therefore seek to moderate his Heat,</l>
<l>To guide his fiery Virtues, that, misled,</l>
<l>By dazling Power and flattering Sycophants,</l>
<l>Might finish what his Father's weaker Measures</l>
<l>Have try'd in vain. And hence I here attend him,</l>
<l>In Expeditions which I ne'er approv'd,</l>
<l>In holy Wars—your Pardon, Reverend Father—</l>
<l>I must declare I think such Wars the Fruit</l>
<l>Of idle Courage or mistaken Zeal,</l>
<l>Sometimes of Rapine and religious Rage,</l>
<l>To every Mischief prompt.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>You wrong, my Lord,</l>
<l>You wrong them much. To set this Matter only</l>
<l>Upon a Civil Footing: say, what Right</l>
<l>Had Robbers rushing from <hi>Arabian</hi> Desarts,</l>
<l>Fierce as the Suns that kindled up their Rage,</l>
<l>Thus, in a barbarous Torrent, to bear down</l>
<l>All <hi>Asia, Africk,</hi> and profane their Altars?</l>
<l>And to repel brute Force by Force is just.</l>
<l>Nay, does not even our Duty, Int'rest, Glory,</l>
<l>The common Honour of the Christian Name,</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="14"/>
Require us to repress their wild Ambition,</l>
<l>That labours westward still, and threatens <hi>Europe?</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GLOSTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Yes, when they burst their Limits, let us check them:</l>
<l>And with a firmer hand than those loose Christians,</l>
<l>The most corrupt and abject of Mankind,</l>
<l>Slaves, doubly Slaves, who suffer'd these <hi>Arabians,</hi></l>
<l>In Virtue their Superiors as in Valour,</l>
<l>To measure Conquest with a Traveller's Speed.</l>
<l>By Rage and Zeal, 'tis true, their Empire rose:</l>
<l>But now some settled Ages of Possession</l>
<l>Create a Right, than which, I fear, few Nations</l>
<l>Can shew a better. Sure I am 'tis Madness,</l>
<l>Inhuman Madness, thus, from half the World,</l>
<l>To drain our Blood and Treasure, to neglect</l>
<l>Each Art of Peace, to set Mankind adrift:</l>
<l>And all for what? By spreading Desolation,</l>
<l>Rapine and Slaughter o'er the other half,</l>
<l>To gain a Conquest we can never hold.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>I venerate this Land. Its sacred Hills,</l>
<l>Its Vales, its Cities, trod by Saints and Prophets,</l>
<l>By GOD himself, the Scenes of heavenly Wonders,</l>
<l>Inspire me with a certain awful Joy.</l>
<l>But the same GOD, my Friend, pervades, sustains,</l>
<l>Surrounds and fills this universal Frame;</l>
<l>And every Land where spreads his vital Presence,</l>
<l>His all-enlivening Breath, to me is holy.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Excuse me, THEALD, if I go too far:</l>
<l>I meant alone to say, I think these Wars</l>
<l>A kind of Persecution. And when that,</l>
<l>That most absurd and cruel of all Vices,</l>
<l>Is once begun, where shall it find an end?</l>
<l>Each, in his turn, or has or claims a Right</l>
<l>To wield its Dagger, to return its Furies;</l>

<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>She faints—My ELEONORA!</l>
<l>Look up, and bless me with thy gentle Eyes!—</l>
<l>The Colour comes, her Cheeks resume their Beauty,</l>
<l>And all her Charms revive—Hence, spurn that Carcass:</l>
<l>A Sight too shocking for my ELEONORA.</l>

<l>'Tis nought, my lovely Princess!—A slight Wound—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELEONORA.</speaker>
<l>But ah! methought, I entering heard of Poison,</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="17"/>
Tainting the Blood—What! was the Dagger poison'd?—</l>
<l>Ha! ssilent all? will none relieve my Fears?—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GLOSTER.</speaker>
<l>Madam, restrain your Tenderness a moment—</l>
<l>The Prince delays too long—Let him retire.</l>
<l>Meanwhile, the troubled Camp shall be my Care;</l>
<l>Lest the base Foe should make a sudden Sally,</l>
<l>While yet our Troops are stun'd with this Disaster.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>I thank thee, noble GLOSTER. Nor, alone,</l>
<l>Support my Troops; go, rouse them to Revenge;</l>
<l>Tell them their injur'd Prince will try their Love,</l>
<l>Their Valour soon—And you, my Friend, good THEALD,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>DARAXA.</speaker>
<l>Princess of <hi>England,</hi> let me share thy Grief.</l>
<l>Whence flow these Tears? and what this wild Alarm,</l>
<l>This Noise of Murder and Assassination?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Alas! the Prince is wounded by a Ruffian;</l>
<l>And with a poison'd Dagger, as I fear.</l>
<l>Yet none will ease me of this racking Thought—</l>
<l>Nay, tell me, THEALD, since to know the worst</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="18"/>
Is oft a kind of miserable Comfort;</l>
<l>What has befal'n the Prince? For this slight Wound</l>
<l>Could never thus o'ercast the Brave with Terror.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>I dare not, Princess, dally with your Fate.</l>
<l>An impious Villain, from the Sultan SELIM,</l>
<l>Pretended to the Prince a secret Message,</l>
<l>About the Peace in Treaty. Dreading nought,</l>
<l>He left us here, and to his Tent retir'd,</l>
<l>There to receive this execrable Envoy.</l>
<l>Strait with the Prince alone, the fierce Assassin</l>
<l>Attempted on his Life; but, in his Arm,</l>
<l>He took, it seems, the Blow, and from the Villain</l>
<l>Wresting the Dagger, plung'd it to his Heart.</l>
<l>This last we saw, and heard th' inhuman Bigot,</l>
<l>Who deem'd himself a Martyr in their Cause,</l>
<l>Boast, as he dy'd, the Prince's Wound was poison'd—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Then all I fear'd is true! then am I wretched,</l>
<l>Beyond even Hope!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DARAXA.</speaker>
<l>A Villain from the Sultan!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELEONORA.</speaker>
<l>Ah the distracting Thought! And is my Life!</l>
<l>My Love! my EDWARD! on the brink of Fate!</l>
<l>Of Fate that may this moment snatch him from me!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DARAXA.</speaker>
<l>What! SELIM send Assassins? and beneath</l>
<l>A Name so sacred? SELIM, whose Renown</l>
<l>Is Incense breathing o'er the sweeten'd East;</l>
<l>For each humane each generous Virtue fam'd;</l>
<l>SELIM! the Rock of Faith! and Sun of Honour!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELEONORA.</speaker>
<l>O complicated Woe! The Christian Cause</l>
<l>Has now no more a Patron, and Restorer;</l>
<l><pb n="12" facs="19"/>
<hi>England</hi> no more a Prince, in whom she plac'd</l>

<l>A Friend, a Lover! and my helpless Children</l>
<l>No more a Father!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DARAXA.</speaker>
<l>Pardon, gentle Princess,</l>
<l>If in this Whirlwind of revolving Passions,</l>
<l>That snatch my Soul by turns, I have forgot</l>
<l>To pay the Tribute which I owe thy Sorrows—</l>
<l>But I my self, alas! am more unhappy!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELEONORA.</speaker>
<l>What Woes can equal mine? who lose, thus vilely,</l>
<l>The Best! the Bravest! Loveliest of Mankind!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DARAXA.</speaker>
<l>You lose the Lover, I must learn to hate him,</l>
<l>To scorn what once wasall my Pride and Transport!</l>
<l>Should EDWARD die by this accursed Crime,</l>
<l>(Which Heaven forbid) he dies admir'd, belov'd,</l>
<l>In the full Bloom of Fame and spotless Honour.</l>
<l>To you, the Daughter of illustrious Grief,</l>
<l>Your Tears remain, and sadly-sweet Reflection;</l>
<l>You with his Image, with his Virtues, still,</l>
<l>Amidst the pensive Gloom, may Converse hold:</l>
<l>While I—Ah! nothing meets my blasted Sight</l>
<l>But a black View of Infamy and Horror!</l>
<l>What is the Loss of Life to Loss of Virtue!—</l>
<l>And yet how can this heavenly Spark be lost?</l>
<l>No! Virtue burns with an immortal Flame.</l>
<l>He is bely'd—some Villain has abus'd him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>I honour, Madam, this your virtuous Grief:</l>
<l>But that the Sultan did employ th'Assassin</l>
<l>Is past all doubt—Behold the false Instructions,</l>
<l>By which he gain'd Admittance.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>DARAXA.</speaker>
<l>To find some Person, that, with friendly Lip,</l>
<l>May draw the Poison forth; at least, its Rage</l>
<l>And mortal Spirit. This will bring the Wound</l>
<l>Within the Power of Art: but certain Death</l>

<speaker>GLOSTER.</speaker>
<l>NO, THEALD, no; he never will consent—</l>
<l>I know him well—he ne'er will purchase Life,</l>
<l>At such a Rate: besides, in aid of Love,</l>
<l>His generous Pride would come, and deem it Baseness.</l>

<l>Then is yon Sun his last. The blackning Wound</l>

<l>Meantime, my Lord, both Friendship and our Duty</l>
<l>Demand, at least, the Trial. Well I know,</l>

<l>O thou bright Sun! now hast'ning to those Climes,</l>
<l><pb n="16" facs="23"/>
That Parent-Isle, which I no more shall see;</l>
<l>And for whose Welfare oft my youthful Heart</l>
<l>Has vainly form'd so many a fond Design;</l>
<l>O thither bear, resplendent Orb of Day,</l>
<l>To that dear Spot of Earth, my last Farewel!</l>

<lg>
<l>And thee, Eternal Providence, whose Course,</l>
<l>Amidst the various Maze of Life, is fix'd,</l>
<l>By boundless Wisdom and by boundless Love,</l>
<l>I follow thee, with Resignation, Hope,</l>
<l>With Confidence and Joy; for thou art good,</l>
<l>And of thy rising Goodness is no end!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Well met, my dearest Friends!—It was too true</l>
<l>The Villain's Threatning, and I nearly touch</l>
<l>That awful Hour which every Man must prove,</l>
<l>Yet every Man still shifts at distance from him.</l>
<l>Come then, and let us fill the Space between,</l>
<l>These last important Moments, whence we take</l>
<l>Our latest Tincture for Eternity,</l>
<l>With solemn Converse and exalting Friendship—</l>
<l>Nay—THEALD—GLOSTER—wound me not with Tears,</l>
<l>With Tears that fall o'er venerable Cheeks!</l>
<l>What could the Princess more?—Ah! there, indeed,</l>
<l>At every Thought of Her, I feel a Weight,</l>
<l>A dreadful Weight of Tenderness, that shakes</l>
<l>My firmest Resolution—Where is she?</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>She burns with fond Impatience to attend you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>And how, brave GLOSTER, did you leave the Camp?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GLOSTER.</speaker>
<l>The Camp, Sir, is secure: each Soldier there</l>
<l>From Indignation draws new Force and Spirit.</l>
<l>O 'tis a glorious, an affecting Sight!</l>
<l>Those furrow'd Cheeks that never knew before</l>
<l><pb n="17" facs="24"/>
The Dew of Tears, now in a copious Shower</l>
<l>Are bath'd. Around your Tent they, various, croud,</l>
<l>Rank over Rank: some pressing for a Look;</l>
<l>Some sadly musing, with dejected Eye;</l>
<l>Some, on their Knees, preserring Vows to Heaven;</l>
<l>And, with extended Arm, some breathing Vengeance.</l>
<l>" Base <hi>Saracens,</hi> they cry, perfidious Cowards!</l>
<l>" But Blood shall wash out Blood—Ah! poor Atonement!</l>
<l>" Did the whole bleeding City fall a Victim!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>What unbought Love and generous Valour fire</l>
<l>The free-born Heart!—Yet moderate their Zeal;</l>
<l>And let the Sword of Justice only strike</l>
<l>The faithless SELIM, and his guilty Creatures.</l>
<l>My new-departed Spirit, just escap'd</l>
<l>From the low fev'rish Passions of this Life,</l>
<l>Would grieve to see the Blood of Innocence,</l>
<l>With that of Guilt confounded, stain my Tomb.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>Permit me, Sir, the Hope, that you your self—</l>
<l>I speak it on just Cause—may live to punish</l>
<l>This Breach of all the sacred Rights of Men.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Why will you turn my Thoughts, from Earth enlarg'd,</l>
<l>To soft enfeebling Views of Life again?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>Not to a vain Desire of Life, my Lord,</l>
<l>I would recal them; but inspire each Hope,</l>
<l>Advise each Possibility to save it.</l>
<l>And there is yet a Remedy.</l>

<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>The fair <hi>Arabian</hi> Princess mention'd one.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>She one!—DARAXA!—something to compleat</l>
<l>Her Lover's Crime.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>You could not wrong her thus,</l>
<l>Had you beheld the Tempest of her Soul,</l>
<l>Her Grief, her Rage, Confusion, when she heard</l>
<l>Of SELIM'S Baseness; had you seen that Honour,</l>
<l>That glorious Fire that parted from her Eyes;</l>
<l>'Till in a Flood of virtuous Sorrow sunk,</l>
<l>She almost equal'd ELEONORA'S Tears.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>What was it she propos'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>It was, my Lord,</l>
<l>To find some Person, who, with friendly Lip,</l>
<l>Might draw the deadly Spirit—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>I have heard</l>
<l>Of such a Cure; but is it not, good THEALD,</l>
<l>An Action fatal to the kind Performer?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>Yes, surely fatal.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Name it then no more.</l>
<l>I should despise the paltry Life it purchas'd.</l>
<l>Besides, what Mortal can dispose so rashly</l>
<l>Of his own Life? Talk not of low Condition,</l>
<l>And of my publick Rank: when Life or Death</l>
<l>Becomes the Question, all Distinctions vanish;</l>
<l>Then the first Monarch and the lowest Slave</l>
<l>On the same Level stand, in This the Sons</l>
<l>Of equal Nature all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="19" facs="26"/>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>Allow me, Sir.</l>
<l>If 'tis a certain, an establish'd Duty,</l>
<l>Than Duty more, the Height of human Virtue,</l>
<l>To sacrifice a transitory Life</l>
<l>For that kind Source from whence it is deriv'd,</l>
<l>And all its guarded Joys, our dearest Country;</l>
<l>To sacrifice it in the Cause of Heaven,</l>
<l>Author of every Good: by the same Reason,</l>
<l>It may be justly sacrific'd for Those</l>
<l>On whom depends the Welfare of the Public.</l>
<l>And there is one, my Lord, who stands devoted,</l>
<l>By solemn and irrevocable Vows,</l>
<l>To die for you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>To die for me!—Kind Nature!</l>
<l>Thanks to thy forming Hand, I can myself,</l>
<l>Chearful, sustain to pay this Debt I owe Thee,</l>
<l>Without the borrow'd Sufferings of Another.</l>
<l>No, THEALD, urge this Argument no more.</l>
<l>I love not Life to that Degree, to purchase,</l>
<l>By the sure Death of some brave guiltless Friend,</l>
<l>A few uncertain Days, that often rise,</l>
<l>Like This, serene and gay, when, with swift Wing,</l>
<l>A Moment wraps them in disastrous Fate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GLOSTER.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Did we consult to save your single Life,</l>
<l>Was that the present Question, thy Refusal</l>
<l>Were just, were generous. But, my Lord, this Person,</l>
<l>Who stands for you devoted, should, in That,</l>
<l>Be deem'd devoted for the Christian Cause,</l>
<l>The common Cause of <hi>Europe</hi> and thy Country.</l>
<l>For That this Martyr dies; dies for thy Children;</l>
<l>Dies for the brave Companions of thy Fortune,</l>
<l>Who weeping now around thy Tent conjure Thee,</l>
<l>To live for them, and <hi>England</hi>'s promis'd Glory.</l>

<l>O I must give it way! My Heart is full</l>
<l>Of Thee, my Country; and my aged Veins,</l>
<l>At Thought of Thee, resume the Fire of Youth.—</l>
<l>If Honour, Glory, can exalt the Mind,</l>
<l>Above the common Passions that involve</l>
<l>The groveling Race of Men; if the first Beauty,</l>
<l>If Virtue drest in her divinest Charms,</l>
<l>All Nature's mingled Tenderness, the Parent,</l>
<l>The Brother, Lover, Friend, can touch the Heart;</l>
<l>O save our Country, EDWARD! save a Nation,</l>
<l>The chosen Land, the last Retreat of Freedom,</l>
<l>Amidst a broken World!—Cast back thy View,</l>
<l>And trace from farthest Times her old Renown.</l>
<l>Think of the Blood that, to maintain her Rights,</l>
<l>And nurse her sheltering Laws, has flow'd in Battle,</l>
<l>Or on the Patriot's Scaffo'd. Think what Cares,</l>
<l>What Vigilance, what Toils, what bright Contention,</l>
<l>In Councils, Camps, and well-disputed Senates,</l>
<l>It cost our generous Ancestors, to raise</l>
<l>A matchless Plan of Freedom: whence we shine,</l>
<l>Even in the jealous Eye of hostile Nations,</l>
<l>The happiest of Mankind.—Then see all This,</l>
<l>This Virtue, Wisdom, Toil and Blood of Ages,</l>
<l>Behold it ready to be lost for ever.</l>
<l>Behold us almost broken to the Yoke,</l>
<l>Robb'd of our antient Spirit, sunk in Baseness,</l>
<l>At home corrupted, and despis'd abroad.</l>
<l>Behold our Wealth consum'd, those Treasures squander'd,</l>
<l>That might protect and nourish wholesom Peace,</l>
<l>Or urge a glorious War; on Wretches squander'd,</l>
<l>A venal Crew that plunder and disgrace us.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>In this important, this decisive Hour,</l>
<l>On Thee, and Thee alone, our weeping Country</l>
<l>Turns her distressful Eye; to Thee she calls,</l>
<l>And with a helpless Parent's piercing Voice.</l>
<l><pb n="21" facs="28"/>
Wilt thou not live for Her? for Her subdue</l>
<l>A graceful Pride, I own, but still a Pride,</l>
<l>That more becomes thy Courage and thy Youth</l>
<l>Than Birth and publick Station? Nay, for Her,</l>
<l>Say, wouldst thou not resign the dearest Passions?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>O there is nothing which for Thee, my Country,</l>
<l>I, in my proper Person, could not suffer!</l>
<l>But thus to sculk behind another's Life,</l>
<l>'Tis what I scarce have Courage to support,</l>
<l>It makes a kind of Coward of me, GLOSTER.</l>
<l>And yet the Reasons urg'd, I must acknowledge,</l>
<l>Demand a deep Regard.—Well—be it so—</l>
<l>Ere to this Instance of amazing Friendship</l>
<l>I can submit, let me behold the Friend.</l>

<l>Struck by the Poison, on her Couch she lies,</l>

<l>O Christian Chief, I never shall forget</l>

<l>How was it, Madam?</l>
</sp>

<l>When this Pride of Woman,</l>
<l>This best of Wives, which in his radiant Course</l>
<l>The Sun beholds, when first she, sickening, felt</l>
<l>Th' imperious Summons of approaching Fate,</l>
<l>All rob'd in spotless White she sought her Altars;</l>
<l>And, prostrate there, for her departing Soul,</l>
<l>The Prince her Husband, and her Orphan-Children,</l>
<l>Implor'd th' ETERNAL MIND.—As yet she held</l>
<l>Her swelling Tears, and in her Bosom kept</l>
<l>Her Sighs repress'd: nor did the near Approach</l>
<l>Of the pale King of Terrors dim her Beauty;</l>
<l><pb n="31" facs="38"/>
No, rather adding to her Charms, it breath'd</l>
<l>A certain mournful Sweetness thro' her Features.</l>
<l>But as th' increasing Bane more desperate grew,</l>
<l>Wild to her Bed she rush'd, and then, indeed,</l>
<l>The lovely Fountains of her Eyes were open'd,</l>
<l>Then flow'd her Tears.—"Connubial Bed, she cry'd,</l>
<l>" Chaste Witness of my Tenderness for him,</l>
<l>" To save whose Life I unrepining die,</l>
<l>" In Bloom of Youth, farewel!—Thou shalt, perhaps,</l>
<l>" Receive a fairer, a more happy Bride;</l>
<l>" But never a more faithful, never one</l>
<l>" Who loves her Husband with a fonder Passion.</l>
<l>Here flow'd her Tears afresh; with burning Lip,</l>
<l>She press'd the humid Couch, and wept again.</l>
<l>At last, while weary Sorrow paus'd, she rose,</l>
<l>And, fearing lest immediate Death might seize Her,</l>
<l>Demanded to be led to see the Prince;</l>
<l>But Fear of chasing from his Eyes, too soon,</l>
<l>The salutary Sleep that heal'd his Pangs,</l>
<l>Restrain'd her trembling Footsteps. On her Couch,</l>
<l>Abandon'd to Despair, she sunk anew,</l>
<l>And for her Children call'd. Her Children came.</l>
<l>A while, supported on her Arm, she ey'd them,</l>
<l>With Tears pursuing Tears a-down her Cheek,</l>
<l>With all the speechless Misery of Woe—</l>
<l>I see her still—O God!—the powerful Image</l>

Might taint their tender Years, she sudden shrunk</l>
<l>With Horror back—"O wretched ELEONORA!</l>
<l>" (She weeping cry'd) and must I then not taste</l>
<l>" The poor remaining Comfort of the Dying,</l>
<l>" To see a Husband, clasp my dearest Children,</l>
<l>" And mix my parting Soul with theirs I love?"</l>
<l>Her sad Attendants, that till then had mourn'd</l>
<l>In silent Sorrow, all, at This, gave way</l>
<l>To loud Laments—She rais'd her languid Eye,</l>
<l>And casting on them round a gracious Smile,</l>
<l>To each by Name she call'd, even to the lowest,</l>
<l>To each extended mild her friendly Hand,</l>
<l>Gave, and, by Turns, receiv'd a last Farewel.</l>

<l>The Manes of thy Ancestors consign</l>
<l>Their long-descended Glory to thy Hands;</l>
<l>And thy dejected Country calls upon thee</l>
<l>To save Her, raise Her, to restore her Honour,</l>
<l>To spread her sure Dominion o'er the Deep,</l>
<l>And bid her yet arise the Scourge of <hi>France.</hi></l>
<l>Angels themselves might envy thee the Joy,</l>
<l>That waits thy Will, of doing general Good:</l>
<l><pb n="51" facs="58"/>
Of spreading Virtue, chearing lonely Worth;</l>
<l>Of dashing down the Proud; of guarding Arts,</l>
<l>The sacred Rights of Industry and Freedom;</l>
<l>Of making a whole generous People happy.</l>
<l>O EDWARD! EDWARD! the most piercing Transports</l>
<l>Of the best Love can never equal These!</l>

<l>Thou brave old Man! thou hast recall'd my Virtue—</l>
<l>I was benumb'd with Sorrow—what—or where—</l>
<l>I know not—never to have thought of this.</l>
<l>Bright Virtue, welcome! Vigour of the Mind!</l>
<l>The Flame from Heaven that lights up higher Being!</l>
<l>Thrice welcome! with thy noble Servant Anger,</l>
<l><pb n="52" facs="59"/>
And just Revenge—Hence, let us to the Camp,</l>
<l>And there transfuse our Soul into the Troops.</l>
<l>This Sultan's Blood will ease my fever'd Breast.</l>
<l>Yes, I will take such Vengeance on this City,</l>
<l>That all Mankind shall turn their Eyes to JAFFA;</l>
<l>And, as they see her Turrets sunk in Dust,</l>
<l>Shall learn to dread the Terrors of the Just.</l>

<l>'Till the wrong'd Sultan's vindicated Honour</l>

<l>Conduct me to the Prince—I claim thy Promise.—</l>
<l>It stings my conscious Soul with sick Impatience,</l>

To ly beneath the burning Imputation</l>
<l>Of Baseness and of Crimes—such horrid Crimes!—</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THEALD.</speaker>
<l>That thou soon shalt do.</l>
<l>He strait will come this Way, the King of <hi>England,</hi></l>
<l>Such now he is. Mean time, 'tis fit to tell thee,</l>
<l>He must be manag'd softly; for his Passions</l>
<l>Are all abroad, in wild Confusion hurl'd:</l>
<l>The Winds, the Floods, and Lightning mix together.</l>
<l>I need not say how little, in this Uproar,</l>

<l>What new accurs'd Attempt is now on foot?</l>
<l>What new Assassination?—Start not, Dervise,</l>
<l>Tinge not thy caitiff Cheek with red'ning Honour.</l>
<l>What thou!—Dost thou pretend to feel Reproach?</l>
<l>Art thou not of a shameless Race of People,</l>
<l>Harden'd in Arts of Cruelty and Blood,</l>
<l>Perfidious all? Yes, have you not profan'd,</l>
<l>The Faith of Nations? Broke the holy Tie</l>
<l>That binds the Families of Earth together,</l>
<l>That gives even Foes to meet with hostile Joy,</l>

<l>If, King of <hi>England,</hi> in this weighty Matter,</l>
<l>On which depends the Weal and Life of Thousands,</l>
<l><pb n="56" facs="63"/>
You love and seek the Truth, let Reason judge,</l>
<l>Cool, steady, quiet and dispassion'd Reason.</l>
<l>For never yet, since the proud selfish Race</l>
<l>Of Men began to jar, did Passion give,</l>
<l>Nor ever can it give, a right Decision.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>Reason has judg'd, and Passion shall chastise,</l>
<l>Shall make you howl, ye Cowards of the <hi>East!</hi></l>
<l>What can be clearer? This vile Prince of <hi>Jaffa!</hi></l>
<l>This Infamy of Princes! Sends a Ruffian,</l>
<l>By his own Hand and Seal commission'd, sends him,</l>
<l>To treat of Peace: And, as I read his Letters,</l>
<l>The Villain stabs me—This, if This wants Light,</l>
<l>There is no Certainty in human Reason;</l>
<l>If This not shines with all-convincing Truth,</l>
<l>Yon Sun is dark—And yet these Cowards come</l>
<l>With lying Shifts, and low elusive Arts—</l>
<l>O it inflames my Anger into Madness!</l>
<l>This added Insult on our Understanding,</l>
<l>This treacherous Attempt to steal away</l>
<l>The only Joy and Treasure of my Life,</l>
<l>Sweet sacred Vengeance for my murder'd Princess!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SELIM.</speaker>
<l>The cursed Wretch who did assail thy Life,</l>
<l>O King of <hi>England,</hi> was indeed an Envoy</l>
<l>Sent by the Prince of <hi>Jaffa:</hi> This we own.</l>
<l>But then he was an execrable Bigot,</l>
<l>Who, for such horrid Purposes, had crept</l>
<l>Into the cheated Sultan's Court and Service;</l>
<l>As by the Traltor's Papers we have learn'd.</l>
<l>For know, there lives, upon the craggy Cliffs</l>
<l>Of wild <hi>Phenician</hi> Mountains, a dire Race,</l>
<l>A Nation of Assassins. Dreadful Zeal,</l>
<l>Fierce and intollerant of all Religion</l>
<l>That differs from their own, is the black Soul</l>
<l>Of that infernal State. Soon as their Chief,</l>
<l><pb n="57" facs="64"/>
The Old Man (so they stile him) of the Mountains,</l>
<l>Gives out his baleful Will, however fell,</l>
<l>However wicked and abhorr'd it be,</l>
<l>Tho' cloth'd in Danger the most cruel Death,</l>
<l>They, swift and silent, glide thro' every Land,</l>
<l>As fly the gloomy Ministers of Vengeance,</l>
<l>Famine and Plague; they ly for Years conceal'd,</l>
<l>Make light of Oaths, nay, sometimes change Religion,</l>
<l>And never fail to execute his Orders.</l>
<l>Of these the Villain was, these ruffian Saints,</l>
<l>The Curse of Earth, the Terror of Mankind:</l>
<l>And the Engagement, Prince, in this Crusado,</l>
<l>That was the Reason whence they sought thy Life</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWARD.</speaker>
<l>False, false as Hell! the Lye of guilty Fear!</l>
<l>You all are Bigots, Robbers, Ruffians all!</l>
<l>It is the very Genius of your Nation.</l>
<l>Vindictive Rage, the Thirst of Blood consumes you:</l>
<l>You live by Rapine, thence your Empire rose;</l>
<l>And your Religion is a meer Pretence</l>
<l>To rob and murder, in the Name of Heaven.</l>

<speaker>SELIM.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Be patient, Prince, be more humane and just.</l>
<l>You have your Virtues, have your Vices too;</l>
<l>And we have ours. The liberal Hand of Nature</l>
<l>Has not created us, nor any Nation,</l>
<l>Beneath the blessed Canopy of Heaven,</l>
<l>Of such malignant Clay, but each may boast</l>
<l>Their native Virtues, and their Maker's Bounty.</l>
<l>You call us Bigots.—Oh! canst thou with that</l>
<l>Reproach us, Christian Prince? What brought thee hither?</l>
<l>What else but Bigotry? What dost thou here?</l>
<l>What else but persecute?—The Truth is great,</l>
<l>Greater than thee, and I will give it Way;</l>
<l><pb n="58" facs="65"/>
Even thou thyself, in all thy Rage, wilt hear it—</l>
<l>From their remotest Source, these holy Wars</l>
<l>What have they breath'd but Bigotry and Rapine?</l>
<l>Did not the first <hi>Crusaders,</hi> when their Zeal</l>
<l>Should have shone out the purest, did they not,</l>
<l>Led by the frantic Hermit who began</l>
<l>The murderous Trade, thro' their own Countries spread</l>
<l>The Woes their Vice could not reserve for ours?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Tho' this exceeds the Purport of my Message,</l>
<l>Yet must I thus insulted in my Country,</l>
<l>Insulted in Religion, bid thee think,</l>
<l>O King of <hi>England,</hi> on the different Conduct</l>
<l>Of <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> when beneath</l>
<l>Your pious GODFREY, in the first Crusado,</l>
<l><hi>Jerusalem</hi> was sack'd, and when beneath</l>
<l>Our generous SALADIN it was retaken—</l>
<l>O hideous Scene! my Soul within me shrinks,</l>
<l>Abhorrent, from the View!—Twelve thousand Wretches,</l>
<l>Receiv'd to Mercy, void of all Defence,</l>
<l>Trusting to plighted Faith, to purchas'd Safety,</l>
<l>Behold these naked Wretches, in cold Blood,</l>
<l>Men, Women, Children, murder'd, basely murder'd!</l>
<l>The holy Temple, which you came to rescue,</l>
<l>Regorges with the barbarous Profanation.</l>
<l>The Streets run dismal Torrents. Drown'd in Blood,</l>
<l>The very Soldier sickens at his Carnage.</l>
<l>Couldst thou, O Sun, behold the blasting Sight,</l>
<l>And lift again thy sacred Eye on Mortals?</l>
<l>A ruthless Race! Who can do This, can do it,</l>
<l>To please the general Father of Mankind!</l>

<l>Go tell thy Master that I hold him base,</l>
<l>Beyond the Power of Words to speak his Baseness!</l>
<l>A Coward! an Assassinating Coward!</l>

<l>Hear but one Witness, and I ask no more,</l>
<l>To clear my Name. The Witness is a Woman.</l>
<l>Her Looks are Truth; fair uncorrupted Faith</l>
