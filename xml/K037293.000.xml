<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. BARRY.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>WHEN first the children of the Muse began</l>
<l>To try their magic on the mind of man,</l>
<l>Astonish'd mortals saw, with wond'ring eyes,</l>
<l>The fair creation of the bard arise.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Hence is deriv'd the Poet's lofty name,</l>
<l>For Poet and Creator mean the same;</l>
<l>He, from his fancy, where the seeds of things</l>
<l>As in a chaos lie, to order brings</l>
<l>Worlds of his own and builds the lofty rhyme</l>
<l>Whose polish'd strength defies the rage of time.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Such were the bards, whom we too call divine,</l>
<l>Homer the father of the godlike line,</l>
<l>The Mantuan bard, whom all mankind admire</l>
<l>For sweet expression and for vestal fire.</l>
<l>Shakespear and Milton, both in England born,</l>
<l>Whose glorious names the Queen of Isles adorn,</l>
<l>Who, proudly sitting on her azure throne,</l>
<l>In arts and empire will no equal own.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus far our Author as a Prologue writ,</l>
<l>And would have been, I think, a-writing yet,</l>
<l>Enamour'd of his theme.—But I drew near,</l>
<l>And whisper'd that of him you wish'd to hear.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>'Twas difficult he said—in such a case</l>
<l>He could have wish'd another in his place;</l>
<l>To tell, with what alternate hopes and fears,</l>
<l>An anxious Author on the Stage appears;</l>
<l>For, like the nightingale, he hath addrest</l>
<l>Himself to sing—a thorn at his fond breast.</l>
<l>If, like the native warbler of the grove,</l>
<l>His plaintive notes are full of tender love;</l>
<l>Your hand may pull the thorn that caus'd his pain</l>
<l>And give him spirit for a nobler strain.</l>

<head>ACT I</head>
<head>SCENE, <stage>a Grove, with Trees blown down.</stage></head>
<stage>Enter KATHUL, King of the Isles, and several of his Attendants.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>FIRST ATTENDANT.</speaker>
<l>King of the Isles—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>I'll hear no more: begone!</l>
<l>Back to the mountains where you left your lord,</l>
<l>Nor dare return without him to the vale.</l>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit Attendants.</stage>
<stage>Enter <hi>Euran.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>EURAN.</speaker>
<l>How have those men provok'd their prince's wrath?</l>
<l>Soft is the voice of Kathul to his people.</l>
<l>What evil have they done?</l>
</sp>
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>My faithful Euran!</l>
<l>Those dastards left their master in the storm</l>
<l>That rose at eve: my son hath pass'd the night</l>
<l>Alone upon the hill beyond the lake.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EURAN.</speaker>
<l>Of him no fear; both hill and dale he knows,</l>
<l>Cavern and cave and every shelter'd spot!</l>
<l>Of the wide forest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>Not one moment's peace</l>
<l>Have I enjoy'd, since to the Pictish king</l>
<l>I gave my daughter's hand. Unhappy she,</l>
<l>In secret anguish pines her life away!</l>
<l>My son, afflicted, shuns his father's sight,</l>
<l>And, in the woods and forests, wastes his days,</l>
<l>A lonely hunter. To complete my woes,</l>
<l>Our new ally keeps not his promis'd time;</l>
<l>Is this his Pictish faith?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EURAN.</speaker>
<l>Doubt not, O king!</l>
<l>Doubt not the faith of Durstan, nor the love</l>
<l>He bears his queen.—Soon shall you see his sails</l>
<l>Rise on the distant wave, white as the fowls</l>
<l>That chase the flying shoals.—When he arrives,</l>
<l>Let not indulgence grant the least delay,</l>
<l>But waft Rivine to the Pictish shore.</l>
<l>When she has left the place, where every tree</l>
<l>And rock and haunted stream recal the memory</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="4"/>Of what she should forget, her grief will fly</l>
<l>Like mist before the wind.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>Rather the mist</l>
<l>Will thicken into darkness. Euran, my heart</l>
<l>Misgives and chides itself. Sprung as I am</l>
<l>From ancient Albion, in her evil days</l>
<l>I left her shatter'd side. By passion sway'd</l>
<l>And rage at perjur'd Ronan, I forsook</l>
<l>The stock of which I came, and join'd myself</l>
<l>By strict alliance to her mortal foe;</l>
<l>To him, whose arm had hew'd her branches down.</l>
<l>From deeds, like this, in wrong of nature done,</l>
<l>Observers date commencement of decay,</l>
<l>And strange disafter to the guilty line.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EURAN.</speaker>
<l>Disaster seize on him who broke his faith,</l>
<l>And threw away the pearl of womankind!</l>
<l>O! could my wish recall that signal hour</l>
<l>When Elig's hall blaz'd with a thousand shields</l>
<l>Of kings and heroes. Emulous to please</l>
<l>The all-admired daughter of the Isles!</l>
<l>Rivine, partial to her brother's friend,</l>
<l>Preferr'd the prince of Morven; tho' by far,</l>
<l>In wealth and power, inferior to the Pict,</l>
<l>And other royal suitors for her love.</l>
<l>Yet he, distinguish'd, favour'd, honour'd thus,</l>
<l>Ungrateful man! forsook the matchless maid,</l>
<l>Without complaint, pretence, abandon'd her,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="5"/>To wed the queen of Erin. <note n="*" place="foot">Ireland.</note>—In my mind</l>
<l>Most happily for thee, and for thy house;</l>
<l>Else thou, the friend of vanquish'd Albion, still</l>
<l>Hadst shar'd the fortunes of a ruin'd people.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<p>Not ruin'd yet—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EURAN.</speaker>
<l>Expell'd their native land,</l>
<l>Their king and more than half his princes slain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>Another king succeeds: Congallus claims</l>
<l>His right of blood.—Here in the bay last night</l>
<l>A rover of the main his vessel moor'd;</l>
<l>He told me he had seen on Norway's coast</l>
<l>A fleet immense: far off, it seem'd a wood,</l>
<l>Stretching from cape to cape; as if the firs</l>
<l>From their eternal mountains had come down,</l>
<l>To grow amidst the waves.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EURAN.</speaker>
<l>Was this huge fleet</l>
<l>Prepar'd against the Pict?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>It was; and charg'd</l>
<l>With mighty armies: both the kings were there</l>
<l>Of <note n="†" place="foot">Denmark.</note> Lochlin and of Norway—On the deck</l>
<l>Of one, the headmost ship, Congallus stood,</l>
<l>Wooing the winds to fill his hoisted sails:</l>
<l>With him, a multitude of warriors, born</l>
<l>In various climes, of the Albanian race;</l>
<l>Who, though they never saw their father's land,</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="6"/>Call it their country too. The foremost they,</l>
<l>The fiercest in her cause.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EURAN.</speaker>
<l>'Tis Ronan's cause!</l>
<l>For him the sons of Erin lift the spear;</l>
<l>For him the kings of Scandinavia arm.</l>
<l>But let them come, the pirates of the North!—</l>
<l>Strong is the Pict, and mighty his allies!</l>
<l>Who can resist the Romans?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>By their force,</l>
<l>And not his own, tho' he is great in arms,</l>
<l>The Pict o'er Albion's warlike sons prevail'd;</l>
<l>But now the Roman eagle southward flies;</l>
<l>The dark-ey'd chief his legions has withdrawn,</l>
<l>To quell the Britons; nor can Durstan hope</l>
<l>Their present aid.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EURAN.</speaker>
<l>—I trust he shall not need!</l>
<l>Behold Rivine comes.—</l>
<stage>[Looking towards the wood.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>—Entranc'd in thought—</l>
<l>See how she tosses to the skies her arms,</l>
<l>Now wrings her folded hands! Thus is she wont</l>
<l>To wander thro' the woods, ever alone,</l>
<l>And ever mourning. Like a wounded deer,</l>
<l>Apart she stalks and seeks the darkest shade</l>
<l>Of hanging rocks, and melancholy boughs,</l>
<l>To hide and nourish her determin'd sorrow.—</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="7"/>Let us avoid her. O! unhappy child!</l>
<l>I fear thy father's counsel has undone thee!</l>
</sp>
<stage>[Exeunt.</stage>
<stage>Enter RIVINE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>How soon is evil done! The sycamores,</l>
<l>The pines, whose bulk successive ages rear'd,</l>
<l>The tempest of one night hath overthrown!</l>
<l>Thou too art fallen, thou fair and stately oak,</l>
<l>Beneath whose pleasant shade Rivine sate,</l>
<l>When first she listen'd to false Ronan's love.</l>
<l>O! thou expressive emblem of my state!</l>
<l>Like thee, the chief in beauty and in place,</l>
<l>I flourish'd once; now rooted up like thee,</l>
<l>I wither on the field. Daily I die!</l>
<l>Delighted, I perceive my swift decay.</l>
<l>There will I make my grave; under that rock,</l>
<l>In peace shall rest the daughter of the Isles,</l>
<l>Who, 'till she's laid in earth, no peace can know,</l>
<l>No peace for me! O! how I envy you,</l>
<l>Ye lovelorn maids! who, slighted and forsaken,</l>
<l>Yet entertain no motion of revenge,</l>
<l>But mildly bear your wrongs, decline and die,</l>
<l>The blameless victims of inconstant man!</l>
<stage>Enter CONNAN.</stage>
<l>Ha! does my brother come to see Rivine!</l>
<l>What has procur'd me this unwonted favour?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>Perhaps, in prudence and in love to thee,</l>
<l>I should conceal my tidings; but my heart</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="8"/>Cannot contain them. Tho' it make thee wretched,</l>
<l>Yet I must tell thee, that my friend is wrong'd.</l>
<l>Ronan is innocent; he loves thee still;</l>
<l>He never ceas'd to love thee!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>I believe it.</l>
<l>He never ceas'd to love, who never lov'd.</l>
<l>But why pretend, why counterfeit again?</l>
<l>Has Erin's queen found out how false he is,</l>
<l>And thrown the specious traitor from her arms?</l>
<l>And does he think once more to find Rivine</l>
<l>Free, credulous and fit to be deceiv'd?</l>
<l>But me he thinks not of; he courts thy aid;</l>
<l>He needs the valour of his partial friend.</l>
<l>A stranger still to what his crimes have done,</l>
<l>He knows not who I am; he does not know,</l>
<l>That Connan's valour guards the Pictish throne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>This flash of indignation, O! my sister!</l>
<l>Gleams for a moment o'er thy troubled mind;</l>
<l>But darkest woe shall shortly close around thee.</l>
<l>I have a dreadful story for thine ear.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>A dreadful story! how can he be wrong'd,</l>
<l>Who publicly renounc'd his plighted faith,</l>
<l>Plighted a thousand times?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>He never did:</l>
<l>He sent no message to renounce thy love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="9"/>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<p>What then was Valma?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>An unhappy wretch,</l>
<l>The slave of gold; gain'd by the worst of men,</l>
<l>To work thine overthrow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>Leave me to judge</l>
<l>Of my condition. Tell me what thou know'st.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>I need not tell Rivine why I shunn'd her,</l>
<l>Since Durstan was her husband; I have fled</l>
<l>The human race, distracted in my mind,</l>
<l>With grief and shame and anger: oft my soul</l>
<l>Resolv'd revenge on Ronan. By-and-by</l>
<l>Something would whisper that we were deceiv'd;</l>
<l>That noble Ronan never could be base.</l>
<l>Perplex'd with thoughts like these, I rang'd the woods,</l>
<l>And heeded not the game my dogs pursu'd.</l>
<l>The storm of yesterday surpriz'd me, stray'd</l>
<l>Beyond my usual bounds; nor could I find,</l>
<l>Amidst the darkness of the driving blast,</l>
<l>A path to guide aright my doubtful steps.—</l>
<l>As night came on, more furious grew the storm.</l>
<l>The thunder bellow'd and the lightning glanc'd</l>
<l>Along the dreary heath: before, behind</l>
<l>And on each side, the sudden torrents roar'd.</l>
<l>I wander'd on and frequently I thought,</l>
<l>The world without was like my troubled mind.</l>
<l>At last, far in the east, whence the wind blew,</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="10"/>I heard the howling of a shepherd's dog;</l>
<l>With lighter steps, I turn'd me to the sound</l>
<l>And heard it oft repeated. As I hop'd,</l>
<l>It led me to a hut—I entered there;</l>
<l>And, by the embers of a fire of turf,</l>
<l>I saw a ghastly man stretch'd on a bed</l>
<l>Of sticks and heath compos'd. Come near, he said,</l>
<l>And listen to the dying voice of Valma.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<p>Of Valma!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>Valma, whom I had not seen</l>
<l>Since he, for Erin, with his master sail'd:</l>
<l>I found he did mistake me for his host,</l>
<l>And silent listen'd with a beating heart.</l>
<l>Your charitable cares, he said, are vain;</l>
<l>My hour draws nigh.—Good shepherd, you have lodg'd'</l>
<l>Under your blameless roof, the basest wretch</l>
<l>That ever liv'd on earth. My name is Valma,</l>
<l>The favour'd servant of the prince of Morven.</l>
<l>My master sent me, from green Erin's shore,</l>
<l>With tokens and a message to his love,</l>
<l>The fair Rivine: but a tempest drove</l>
<l>My luckless vessel on the Pictish coast.</l>
<l>Durstan, the king, by promises and threats,</l>
<l>Compell'd me to deceive the constant maid,</l>
<l>And falsely to report, that my brave lord</l>
<l>Renounc'd her love.—Rivine, thou grow'st pale!</l>
<l>Lean on my arm.—.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="11"/>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>No: I have strength enough!</l>
<l>Lead me, my brother! lead me to the place</l>
<l>Where Valma is.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<p>At midnight he expir'd—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>Would he had liv'd one other day for me!</l>
<l>O! I had much to ask him: did not Ronan,</l>
<l>With eyes of love behold the beauteous queen?</l>
<l>So I have often heard and that was told</l>
<l>Long before Valma came.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>Ay, so it was</l>
<l>Contriv'd and told, on purpose to prepare</l>
<l>Thy mind, thus tainted, to receive the tale.</l>
<l>But know, for I explor'd the heart of Valma,</l>
<l>The noble Ronan, in the hall of kings,</l>
<l>Who sought alliance with so brave a chief,</l>
<l>Fondly display'd—his passion for Rivine.</l>
<l>With gems of thine he deck'd his conq'ring arms,</l>
<l>And rais'd the song of beauty to thy praise!</l>
<l>Such ostentation wither'd the desire</l>
<l>And kill'd the hope of every blushing maid.</l>
<l>The hero comes, unalter'd in his love,</l>
<l>And finds thee—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>Connan! me he shall not find!</l>
<l>We ne'er shall meet again—when does he come?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="12"/>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>Be-like to-morrow, or perhaps to day.</l>
<l>This is the appointed time, the season meet</l>
<l>For enterprize of arms. Now the mild moon</l>
<l>Of autumn rises when the sun descends,</l>
<l>And at the self-same hour, for many a night,</l>
<l>Lifts her fair head, to bless with light the world.</l>
<l>I mean to share the perils of my friend;</l>
<l>Nor shall Rivine as an hostage go</l>
<l>Against her brother's and her Ronan's sword.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>Would that the swords of both were in my b east!</l>
<l>Ye winds, that I have wish'd should sleep for ever;</l>
<l>Ye southern winds! from Etha's mountains blow,</l>
<l>And waft to Elig's bay the Pictish fleet!</l>
<l>I go to Durstan's kingdom—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>Go, and perish!</l>
<l>Hast thou no rage, no indignation in thee?</l>
<l>No generous drop in thy exhausted veins?</l>
<l>Art thou so tame, so vile, so base of soul,</l>
<l>To bear the sight of Durstan? Crimes like his</l>
<l>Dissolve all ties. Besides his wrongs to thee,</l>
<l>He murder'd Valma on the lonely heath;</l>
<l>Murder'd the traitor to conceal the treason.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>Yes, I am base and vile; my soul submits</l>
<l>To each opprobrious name from Ronan's friend;</l>
<l>But I am not so tame: my heart is full</l>
<l>Of rage, of anger and of mortal hatred!—</l>

<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<p>To whom?</p>

<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>Renounce the name,</l>
<l>And thou may'st still—Thy brother will defend,</l>
<l>And save thee from his power.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>O! save not me</l>
<l>From any misery! But tell me rather,</l>
<l>How I may be more wretched than I am:</l>
<l>If thou can'st tell. Farewel my native land!</l>
<l>Ye woods and streams of Elig's vale, farewel!</l>
<l>Rivine leaves you with a broken heart,</l>
<l>To waste her days in horror and despair,</l>
<l>With the detested author of her woes.</l>
<l>But welcome woe to me! Fool that I was,</l>
<l>A wretch unworthy of a hero's love,</l>
<l>Who readily believ'd a lying tale,</l>
<l>Against the honour of the first of men:</l>
<l>Then in the cursed hour of jealous rage,</l>

<l>Now would'st thou have me stay till Ronan comes?</l>
<l>'Tis not his anger, nor his hate I fear;</l>
<l>No, nor his scorn. My just desert is scorn;</l>
<l>But hide me, rocks and mountains, from his pity!</l>

<l>From his embrace I turn'd me to the shore:</l>
<l>His arm he stretch'd, and caught my hand again;</l>

<l>The blame as yet on Durstan only falls.</l>
<l>Would I had never join'd my hand to his,</l>

<l>Than practise art on unexperienc'd youth,</l>
<l>Whose passions sally out beyond conjecture,</l>
<l>And, by extravagance, confound the wise.</l>
<l>The passions of this prince are like the wind:</l>
<l>The Pictish name is odious to the tribes,</l>

<l>Thou can'st no more deceive me. The long train</l>

<l>O! thou sole relique of the first of men!</l>
<l>Signal of death! memorial of the brave!</l>
<l>Companion of my woes, perhaps the end!</l>
<l>Why didst thou thirst, O! Durstan for his blood?</l>
<l>Hadst thou not wrong'd him, was not that enough</l>
<l>But thou didst wisely, to consult thy safety,</l>
<l>For conscience told thee, whilst the warrior liv'd,</l>
<l>The robber was not safe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURSTAN.</speaker>
<l>Thy words are madness;</l>
<l>If I had kill'd him, was he not my foe?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>How did the hero fall?—By fraud he fell!</l>
<l>For he was still invincible in arms,</l>
<l>Alone a match for many in the field.</l>

<l>That sword, the sight of which disturbs thy soul,</l>

<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>Now, I believe thee, Durstan! Tell me, Pict!</l>

<speaker>DURSTAN.</speaker>
<l>As in our way to thee we crost those seas,</l>
<l>Whose rage scarce summer tames, a tempest rose,</l>
<l>A dreadful one, as ever swept the main.</l>
<l>All night we labour'd in the jaws of death.</l>
<l>But, when the morning dawn'd, the tempest ceas'd;</l>
<l>Red, on the troubled deep, the sun arose,</l>
<l>And shew'd a dismal object to our eyes;</l>
<l>Fast, on a ridge of rocks, a wreck appear'd,</l>
<l>Which seem'd the ruin of a noble vessel;</l>
<l>Near as our safety would permit we sail'd,</l>
<l>And view'd the fate, which might have been our own.—</l>
<l>The ship was broken, by the heavy seas</l>

<l>Dead bodies floated, on the tossing waves.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<p>Was there no living creature?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURSTAN.</speaker>
<l>No, not one,</l>
<l>Low are the rocks; their ragged tops are seen,</l>
<l>And barely seen above the smoothest sea;</l>
<l>But in a storm their place is known afar,</l>
<l>By the white waves, that rage, and swell, and break</l>
<l><pb n="21" facs="22"/>Like mountains o'er them; there no man could live.</l>
<l>Who'er aboard that luckless vessel sail'd,</l>

<p>Was the sword there?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>It was. About to leave</l>
<l>The wreck, we sought some token of the dead</l>
<l>By which they might be known, that sword we spied,</l>
<l>Caught in the cordage of a mast it hung</l>
<l>And glitter'd through the water.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>'Tis enough!</l>
<l>If at my feet his breathless body lay,</l>
<l>I could not be more certain of his fate.</l>
<l>In those wild waves the chief of warriors died;</l>
<l>To me he hasten'd through the seas and storms;</l>
<l>Unknowing of his wrongs for me he died.</l>

<l>For thro' the kingdoms of the North his name</l>
<l>Flew on the wings of Fame.—His love to me</l>
<l>And mine to him, for I avow my love,</l>
<l>My sire approv'd.—To him I was betroth'd,</l>
<l>But in his absence, Durstan did seduce,</l>
<l>A faithless servant to betray his master.</l>
<l>He fram'd a message from the noble Ronan,</l>
<l>Rejecting me, and setting free my faith;</l>
<l>Then urg'd a fond exasperated maid,</l>
<l>And with the help of her deceived father,</l>
<l>Precipitated her disorder'd mind,</l>
<l>To yield a rash consent.—That was my crime,</l>
<l>Which I deny not; nor refuse to bear</l>
<l>My punishment, which, like my crime, is great.</l>
<l>Despair consumes me! wither'd like the leaf</l>
<l>Of autumn is my beauty. Now I stand</l>

<head>ACT III.</head>
<head>SCENE, <stage>a Cliff on the Sea-shore, with a Cave.</stage></head>
<stage>RIVINE and ORELLAN.</stage>
<sp>
<stage>ORELLAN.</stage>
<l>BEHOLD the habitation of Orellan!</l>
<l>For threescore years and ten this rock has been</l>
<l>My dwelling-place; and here I sit in sorrow,</l>
<l>Silent and motionless from morn to eve;</l>
<l>'Till the sea-fowl, that skim along the shore,</l>
<l>Fearless alight, and, sitting at my feet,</l>
<l>Scream their wild notes, as if I was a stone</l>
<l>Or senseless trunk, that could not do them harm.—</l>
<l>It was not always thus; I was not born</l>
<l>To misery; nor in the wild woods bred</l>
<l>Of savage race; fair was my morn of youth!</l>
<l>With thy brave grandsire I was train'd to arms,</l>
<l>His chosen warrior, and his trusted friend.</l>
<l>But love and jealousy surpriz'd my soul,</l>
<l>Drove me from men, and blotted out my name.</l>
<l>This arm slew Namora.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>Father, forgive</l>
<l>My importunity! Vouchsafe to tell</l>
<l>What I in part have heard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="32"/>
<speaker>ORELLAN.</speaker>
<l>My story's old,</l>
<l>Thy sorrow recent: but to hear my woes</l>
<l>Will teach thee patience. Such as thou art now,</l>
<l>Or as thou wast, e'er grief had made thee wan,</l>
<l>Namora was. Like thine, her beauty charm'd</l>
<l>Contending princes; but the generous maid</l>
<l>Preferr'd to princes fond Orellan's love.</l>
<l>Daily we met in woods, in groves, in glades,</l>
<l>Remote and secret. One unhappy time,</l>
<l>Returning from the chace, I sought the grove.</l>
<l>Ent'ring, I saw Namora; her white arms</l>
<l>Embrac'd a youth; her lips were join'd to his.</l>
<l>My bow was in my hand; I bent it soon,</l>
<l>And pierc'd them with one arrow. Ere I reach'd</l>
<l>The spot on which they fell, Namora's eyes</l>
<l>Were clos'd for ever. The expiring youth</l>
<l>Was her brave brother, to his native shore</l>
<l>That day return'd. His sister's steps he trac'd,</l>
<l>To perish in her arms. I kneel'd me down,</l>
<l>And begg'd the warrior, if he yet had strength,</l>
<l>To give me death. He heard me not, he died,</l>
<l>And left me living.—This bleak cave I chose,</l>
<l>My everlasting mansion. In those days</l>
<l>The hollow shore resounded with my cries.</l>
<l>Often the hunter hasten'd from the hill,</l>
<l>And oft the mariner steer'd from the deep,</l>
<l>And wonder'd at me. Time, that rage subdued</l>
<l>To milder grief. My tears incessant flow'd</l>
<l>Like waters from the rock. Here have I mourn'd</l>
<l><pb n="32" facs="33"/>An age of man compleat. Alike to me</l>
<l>Summer and winter, autumn an the spring,</l>
<l>And night and day the same.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>Thus would I wish</l>
<l>To waste my days, a spectacle of woe!</l>
<l>Without or change or interval. I feel</l>
<l>Within myself a source and spring of sorrow,</l>
<l>That ne'er will cease to flow, 'till death shall stop it.</l>
<l>Surely the spirits of the dead delight</l>
<l>To be remember'd, and lamented, father.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORELLAN.</speaker>
<l>Daughter, they do—my own experience tells.—</l>
<l>Once every year, that day Namora died,</l>
<l>A wondrous vision comes. In the still air</l>
<l>(For not a breath then stirs the silent bay)</l>
<l>Are heard the saddest, yet the sweetest sounds,</l>
<l>That ever touch'd the ear or heart of man,</l>
<l>The melody of woe.—Then from the skies</l>
<l>Descend the shadows of the murder'd pair,</l>
<l>Pale as the colours of the lunar bow.</l>
<l>Hov'ring before the cavern's mouth they spread</l>
<l>Their arms; they fix on me their pitying eyes,</l>
<l>And, with a shriek, they vanish into air:</l>
<l>Does hoar tradition tell a tale like this?</l>
<l>Was ever mortal destiny like mine?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>Could I but hope to see my love arise,</l>
<l>And look on me with pity; I would live</l>
<l>In the vast ocean on a rock alone.</l>
<l><pb n="33" facs="34"/>But Ronan's injur'd ghost detests Rivine.—</l>
<l>In the dark world of spirits thou shalt join</l>
<l>Thy dear Namora's shade; but far from mine</l>
<l>The angry spirit of my love will fly.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORELLAN.</speaker>
<l>I have another charge besides thee, daughter!</l>
<l>Within my cave a wretched stranger lies,</l>
<l>Who tasted all the bitterness of death;</l>
<l>But scarce yet knows his wonderful escape.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<p>Escape from what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORELLAN.</speaker>
<l>From shipwreck in the storm</l>
<l>That raged last night upon the rocky shore.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>From shipwreck! ha! Is he a man in years,</l>
<l>Or of the youthful time?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORELLAN.</speaker>
<l>In prime of youth,</l>
<l>And beautiful he seem'd, tho' in the arms</l>
<l>Of death upon the naked beach he lay.</l>
<l>I found him there. Attentive I perceiv'd</l>
<l>That the warm life was not wholly fled.</l>
<l>I call'd a shepherd swain to give me help,</l>
<l>Who from a neighbouring hill survey'd the deep.</l>
<l>He came, and willing in his arms he bore</l>
<l>The youth insensible; he brought him hither.</l>
<l>Within he lies, stretch'd on the skins of deers;</l>
<l>A sleep profound has seiz'd him; when he wakes</l>
<l>He will not know, if in a friendly place,</l>
<l><pb n="34" facs="35"/>Or in the dwelling of his foes he lies.—</l>
<l>I'll go—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<p>Not yet a while.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORELLAN.</speaker>
<l>Thy colour shifts</l>
<l>From pale to red, from red to pale again.</l>
<l>What dost thou hope or fear?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>A strange event!</l>
<l>Yet, like the fate and fortune of my life,</l>
<l>Wild and incredible. Perhaps this youth</l>
<l>Sav'd from the wreck, and sleeping in thy cell,</l>
<l>Is Ronan.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORELLAN.</speaker>
<l>No; delusive are thy hopes;</l>
<l>The various vest and floating robe I know</l>
<l>Of Albion's warlike race. He wore not those.</l>
<l>His dress is splendid, bright with foreign gold,</l>
<l>And marks the chieftain of a distant land.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>Enter, and if he sleeps, to me return,</l>
<l>I will behold and bless him where he lies;</l>
<l>Then from his presence fly, if it is Ronan.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORELLAN.</speaker>
<l>I hear a noise within; the stranger comes;</l>
<l>His steps sound on the rock.</l>

<l>Thou venerable man,</l>
<l>Preserver of my life! for so methinks</l>

<l>The waves have thrown me? For the place imports</l>

<p>'Tis he! 'Tis Ronan!</p>

<p>Not call thee mine!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>No, never, never more!</l>
<l>I am unworthy of thy least regard;</l>
<l>Unworthy of the air that Ronan breathes.</l>
<l>When thou shalt know what cannot be conceal'd</l>
<l>Thou must abhor me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<l>I abhor Rivine!</l>
<l>Ah! thou art chang'd indeed since I beheld thee!</l>
<l>Anguish gleams in thine eye, and wild despair</l>
<l>Contends with shame.—Rivine, speak and save me</l>
<l>From horrible conjectures.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RIVINE.</speaker>
<l>Spare a wretch,</l>

<l>To every circumstance of this misfortune,</l>

<l>Tell me one circumstance, I ask no more;</l>
<l>Is she not wedded?</l>

<l>Listen to my words,</l>

<l>Then I may hear thy story.</l>

<l>How this disaster did o'ertake thy love.—</l>

<l>Wilt thou not say what the disaster is?</l>
<l>How tedious, hard, and obstinate is age!</l>

<l>Unless I should deceive thee to thy hurt,</l>
<l>I can no longer hide from thee the truth.</l>

<p>Then she is wedded?</p>
</sp>

<p>Dost thou say yes?</p>

<l>Unwillingly I speak the painful truth:</l>
<l>My soul is griev'd for thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<l>Thou art the cause</l>
<l>Of what I suffer. Thy officious hand</l>
<l>Sav'd me from death, to make me perish worse.</l>
<l>My latest thought when sinking in the storm</l>
<l>Was of Rivine; of her love, her truth,</l>
<l>Her grief eternal for her Ronan lost.—</l>
<l>And now I find her in another's arms;</l>
<l>Of me regardless, though my faithful heart,</l>
<l>Full of her image, for her sake despis'd</l>
<l>The beauteous queen of Erin's warlike land.</l>

<l>Durstan, my mortal foe!</l>

<l>From all mankind has she selected him,</l>
<l>Whom most my soul abhorr'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORELLAN.</speaker>
<l>She never chose:</l>
<l>She was betray'd, deluded, and compell'd.</l>
<l>Thy servant Valma, gain'd by Durstan's gold,</l>
<l>Deliver'd to Rivine a false message;</l>
<l>Cold and contemptuous, full of slight excuse,</l>
<l>For breach of faith confest, and worst of all</l>
<l>Fraught with the praises of the beauteous queen,</l>
<l>Whose love had made thee lord of Erin's land.</l>

<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<p>Could she believe him?</p>

<l>The bold traitor swore,</l>
<l>That he was witness to the proud espousals.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>O! villain! villain! Did she credit this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>How could she doubt it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Ha! did she not know me?</l>
<l>Did not each action of my life belie</l>
<l>The monstrous tale?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORELLAN.</speaker>
<l>Long before that, the Isles</l>
<l>Resounded with the fame of thy great acts</l>
<l>In Erin's wars perform'd; and rumour spread</l>
<l>Abroad the story of the grateful queen.</l>

<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<p>This day!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORELLAN.</speaker>
<l>The fraud of Durstan was detected,</l>
<l>And from presumption strong thy death believ'd;</l>
<l>Rivine, who till then conceal'd her anguish</l>
<l><pb n="40" facs="41"/>And veil'd with sickly smiles her broken heart,</l>
<l>Then own'd her love and publish'd her despair.</l>
<l>With threats the Pict requires his wedded wife:</l>
<l>Connan defies him, and demands the combat.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>But mine the cause, and mine shall be the combat.</l>

<l>The tribes are up in arms; for strong the host</l>
<l>That haughty Durstan leads.</l>
</sp>

<head>ACT IV.</head>
<head>SCENE, <stage>a Thick Wood.</stage></head>
<stage>Enter KATHUL and CONNAN.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>MY friend is dead. But friendship never dies.</l>
<l>Remember, Sir, how Ronan fought for me.</l>
<l>The youth were met in the sequester'd vale,</l>
<l>And held a feast of joy. The bards arose,</l>
<l>And sung heroic deeds atchiev'd of old.</l>
<l>Rous'd with the song the chiefs began to boast</l>
<l>Their own exploits in arms. Above the rest</l>
<l>Proud Armor vaunted, trusting in his strength;</l>
<l>Truth he regarded not; he told how once,</l>
<l>In Ardven's vale he met the blue-ey'd maid,</l>
<l>Old Alpine's daughter; Connan was her guard,</l>
<l>Who shun'd the combat, and resign'd the maid.</l>
<l>Silent and pale my sad companions heard;</l>
<l>But from the banquet generous Ronan rose,</l>
<l>And dar'd the giant to maintain his words,</l>
<l>By combat on the plain. Furious they met,</l>
<l>Like two strong bulls contending for the herd;</l>
<l>They fought from mid-day 'till the setting sun</l>
<l>Gilded the vale; then Ronan's arm prevail'd,</l>
<l>And Armor bit the ground. Fast by the lake,</l>
<l>Mark'd with a stone, is seen his lengthen'd grave;</l>
<l><pb n="47" facs="48"/>Eternal monument of Ronan's faith</l>
<l>And of his glory; but of shame to me,</l>
<l>If e'er my soul forgets the hero's love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>Ha! who comes yonder rushing from the wood,</l>
<l>Swift as the roe? see at one bound he leaps</l>
<l>From bank to bank the brook. Connan, beware!</l>
<l>His ready weapon glitters in his hand.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>Spirits of earth and air! 'tis Ronan's form!</l>
<l>Thus have I seen him hasten to the field,</l>
<l>Thus spring exulting when the foe drew near.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>Oft have I heard the voice of mournful ghosts,</l>
<l>Borne on the wings of the careering winds,</l>
<l>But ne'er 'till now beheld—It stops and glares</l>
<l>With angry eyes on me. Speak thou, my son!</l>
<l>For ye were one.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> RONAN.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>O spirit of my friend!</l>
<l>Com'st thou to urge thy Connan to revenge?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<l>I am no spirit: come, my faithful friend,</l>
<l>And in my arms feel that thy Ronan lives.</l>
<l>Now art thou satisfy'd?—</l>
<stage>[They embrace.]</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>I am transported!</l>
<l>Ronan to life restor'd and at my side,</l>
<l><pb n="48" facs="49"/>When in despair against his foes I arm'd!</l>
<l>I have a thousand questions, but not now.</l>
<l>I must be sudden and abrupt, my friend!</l>
<l>The times are so.—Sad tidings thou must hear.</l>
<l>But let resentment chase thy grief away:</l>
<l>The salve of sorrow is a brave revenge.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<l>I come to seek revenge; my wrongs I know,</l>
<l>For I have seen Rivine. Where is Durstan?</l>
<l>I hop'd to meet him in the battle's front;</l>
<l>But peace is here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>No, prince of Morven, no!</l>
<l>Peace dwells not here. Between the swords I came</l>
<l>Of raging warriors and obtain'd a truce</l>
<l>Until to-morrow's dawn. Altho' my hope</l>
<l>Of reconcilement at thy presence fades,</l>
<l>My troubled soul rejoices in thy safety.</l>
<l>Thy timeless death I mourn'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<l>King of the isles!</l>
<l>Why didst thou give thy daughter to the Pict?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>Ronan, I was deceiv'd. I hold thee dear,</l>
<l>And wish—But nothing can recal the past.—</l>
</sp>

<p>Recal the past!</p>

<pb n="49" facs="50"/>
<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<l>Be not alarmed!</l>
<l>O! King! thou art the father of my friend,</l>
<l>The father of my lov'd my lost Rivine.</l>
<l>And that restrains my tongue. Yet I must say,</l>
<l>Hadst thou been constant to thy old allies,</l>
<l>Hadst thou been faithful, and preserv'd my bride,</l>
<l>This day had crown'd thy hoary head with joy.</l>
<l>Impatient to behold my love, I fail'd</l>
<l>And left behind the Scandinavian fleet</l>
<l>Of warriors full. With these lerne's sons</l>
<l>And Erin's chiefs for injur'd Albion arm.</l>
<l>Selma shall rise again.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>May Selma rise,</l>
<l>And Albion's honour'd race for ever reign.</l>
<l>Yet hear me Ronan! from my heart I speak;</l>
<l>Thou bear'st a noble mind; thy fame is great</l>
<l>For justice as for valour; with the Pict</l>
<l>Thou hast a rightful quarrel; but respect</l>
<l>This hospitable shore; contend not here,</l>
<l>Nor fight with Durstan for his wedded wife.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<l>Not fight with Durstan! then let Durstan fly</l>
<l>And I shall follow, to whatever shore</l>
<l>He takes his flight.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KATHUL.</speaker>
<l>I understand thee well.—</l>
<l>My son do thou regard thy sister's fame!</l>
<l>A fairer aspect much her conduct wore,</l>
<l><pb n="50" facs="51"/>When thy lov'd friend was number'd with the dead,</l>
<l>Than now, when he in arms her husband braves.—</l>
<l>I go to meet the antients of the land,</l>
<l>The hoary counsellors, who can compare</l>
<l>The present trouble with the times of old,</l>
<l>And call experience to vouch their counsel.</l>
<l>Under the spreading beech that shades the brook</l>
<l>They sit and ruminate.</l>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<l>Their thoughts I know.</l>
<l>Cold are the counsels of inactive age,</l>
<l>Patient of injury, averse to arms.</l>
<l>I long for vengeance and my soul is sick</l>
<l>Of this delay. But why shou'd I defer</l>
<l>My just revenge? no truce was made for me;</l>
<l>I'll send him a defiance.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>Not to day,</l>
<l>Nor yet to morrow do I wish the Pict</l>
<l>By Ronan's hand to fall.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<l>If he should fall</l>
<l>By any other hand, I'm not reveng'd.</l>
<l>We're interrupted. Ha! what man is that,</l>
<l>Who steps so haughtily before the rest?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<p>It is the Pict.—</p>

<l>I sought the king—</l>
<l>But thou, who hast usurp'd thy father's power,</l>
<l>May in his absence answer.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<p>What's thy question?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURSTAN.</speaker>
<l>A plain one, whither was the vessel bound,</l>
<l>That left the shore just now with crouded sails?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>I know not what she is, nor whither bound.</l>
<l>Why dost thou ask of me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURSTAN.</speaker>
<l>I do suspect,</l>
<l>She is dispatch'd to summon to your aid,</l>
<l>The warriors of the isles.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>Perhaps she is;</l>
<l>Credit thy worst suspicion; break the truce</l>
<l><pb n="52" facs="53"/>And I will thank thee. I desir'd no truce</l>
<l>And never will have cordial peace with thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURSTAN.</speaker>
<l>My faith, young man, is plighted to thy father,</l>
<l>And he shall own, to vindicate my fame,</l>
<l>That Durstan sought not to lay waste his isles,</l>
<l>Nor stay his people.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CONNAN.</speaker>
<l>If thou art sincere,</l>
<l>And tender of the lives of blameless men,</l>
<l>With me decide the quarrel; shou'd I fall,</l>
<l>Rivine's dowry is a kingdom then.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DURSTAN.</speaker>
<l>Not that I fear thine arm, do I decline</l>
<l>To answer thy proud challenge; but thou art</l>
<l>The brother of Rivine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Wise thy words,</l>
<l>And just the reason thou assign'st, O! King!</l>

<p>Thou! who art thou!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<l>Not less in blood and birth</l>

<l>Soon shalt thou know,</l>
<l>Perhaps, somewhat too soon, the name I bear;</l>
<l>But, first, I'll tell thee thy detested deeds,</l>

<l>To endless misery, a royal fair,</l>
<l>Who dies of grief and hate to the assassin!</l>

<l>A man unlike the rest of mortals dwells!</l>

<l>Strange it is,</l>

<l>This error to its source. You call'd me Durstan,</l>

<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<p>Did'st thou come hither too, to meet the Pict?</p>

<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<p>Euran.</p>

<l>The traitor! 'tis as I suspected.</l>
<l>That villain is confederate with Durstan,</l>

<l>And sent us forth, to shock, and sink together,</l>
<l>Like vessels in a storm.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RONAN.</speaker>
<l>It must be so;</l>
<l>The circumstances banish every doubt.</l>
<l>This is another plot of that dark brain</l>
<l>Whose cruel guile at first o'erthrew my love.</l>
<l>Am I a beast of chace, a harmless deer,</l>
<l>For whom the hunter plants his mortal toils,</l>
<l>Himself secure and safe?</l>

<l>One silent shaft,</l>

<l>It is but weakness, when on death resolv'd,</l>

<l>Yet it is nature. Thrice I lifted up</l>
<l>The steel against my life, and thrice let fall</l>

<l>A woman desperate, a wretch like me,</l>
<l>Ended her woes; her woes were not like mine.</l>

<l>Nor am I less belov'd. Who hears me now?</l>

<l>Oh! Ronan! Ronan!</l>
<l>O! my ill-fated sister! love of thee</l>
<l>Brought down the towering eagle of the war,</l>
<l>From his high rock of fame. Let me not blame,</l>
<l>Pity forbid that I should blame the dust</l>
<l>Of poor Rivine—Bear the bodies hence,</l>
<l>Let not old Kathul see his daughter's blood:—</l>
<l>I left him standing by the corse of Euran.</l>
<l>O'erwhelm'd and dumb with grief.—</l>

<l>I am the cause</l>
<l>Of all that has befallen. Thy father's steps</l>
<l>Turn to his hall no more: deaf is mine ear</l>
<l>For ever to the voice of youth and joy.</l>
<l>Orellan's lonely cave shall hide my grief.</l>
<l>There we will dwell together and decay</l>
<l>Like two old trees, whose roots hang uppermost</l>

<l>Wasteth a portion of the mould'ring soil</l>

<l>I am resolv'd:</l>
<l>To thee, my son, the sceptre I resign;</l>
<l>I trust 'twill prosper in thy stedfast hand.</l>
<l>Thou wilt not listen to the tale of lies,</l>
<l>Nor in rash mood forsake thine antient friends.</l>
<l>Oh! friend of Ronan! be the peoples friend.</l>
<l>Still let thy open gate receive the stranger,</l>
<l>Who from the hill or from the ship descends,</l>
<l>So shall thy name like grateful odour spread</l>
<l>From thy own dwelling to far distant lands.</l>
<l>I have no other wish. My son farewel!</l>

<l>To morrow we a monument shall raise</l>
<l>To mark the place where mighty Ronan rests</l>
<l>With fair Rivine, in the house of death.</l>
<l>If right my soul forebodes they shall not lie</l>
<l>In dark oblivion; on their buried woes</l>
<l>The light refulgent of the song shall rise</l>
<l>And brighten the sad tale to future times.</l>
<l>The brave, the fair shall give the pleasing tear</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by Mr. GARRICK.</byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. ABINGTON.</byline>
<stage>[Enters in a Hurry.]</stage>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>FORGIVE my coming thus, our griefs to utter—</l>
<l>I'm such a figure!—and in such a flutter—</l>
<l>So circumstanc'd, in such an aukward way,</l>
<l><hi>I know not what to do, or what to say.</hi></l>
<l>Our bard, a strange unfashionable creature,</l>
<l>As obstinate, as savage in his nature,</l>
<l>Will have no Epilogue!—I told the brute—</l>
<l>If Sir, these trifles don't <hi>your</hi> genius suit;</l>
<l>We have a working Prologue-smith, within,</l>
<l>Will strike one off, as if it were a pin.</l>
<l>Nay, Epilogues <hi>are</hi> Pins,—whose points, well-plac'd,</l>
<l>Will trick your Muse out, in the tip-top taste!</l>
<l>Pins, madam! (frown'd the Bard) the Greeks us'd none,</l>
<l>(Then mutt'ring Greek—something like this,—wenton)</l>
<l><hi>Pinnos, painton, patcheros, non Graeco Modon.</hi>"</l>
<l>I coax'd, he swore—"That tie him to a stake,</l>
<l>He'd suffer all for Decency's fair sake;</l>
<l>No Bribery should make him change his plan."</l>
<l>There's an odd mortal. Match him if you can.</l>
<l>Hah, sir! (said I)—your reasoning is not deep,</l>
<l>For when at Tragedies spectators weep,</l>
<l><hi>They oft, like children, cry thems elves asleep.</hi></l>
<l>And if no jogging Epilogue you write,</l>
<l>Oit, Box, and Gallery, may sleep all night:</l>
<l>"Like harmless infants mourn themselves asleep. ALEX.</l>
<l><pb facs="79"/>
"Better (he swore)—a nap should overtake ye,</l>
<l>"Than Folly should to Folly's pranks awake ye;</l>
<l>"Rakes are more harmless nodding upon benches,</l>
<l>"Than ogling to insnare poor simple wenches;</l>
<l>"And simple girls had better close their eyes,</l>
<l>"Than send 'em gadding after butterslies.</l>
<l>"Nay, should a statesman make a box his nest;</l>
<l>"Who, that his country loves, would break his rest?</l>
<l>"Let come what may, I will not make 'em laugh,</l>
<l>"Take for an <hi>Epilogue</hi>—This <hi>Epitaph.</hi></l>
<l>"For as my lovers lives, I would not save,</l>
<l>"No pois'nous weeds shall root upon their grave."</l>
<l>Tis thus these pedant Greek-read poets vapour—</l>
<l>Is it your pleasure I should read the paper?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l><hi>Here, in the arms of death, a matchless pair,</hi></l>
<l><hi>A young-lov'd hero, and beloved fair,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Now find repose.—Their virtues tempest-tost,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Sea-sick, and weary, reach the wish'd-for coast.</hi></l>
<l><hi>Whatever mortal to this spot is brought,</hi></l>
<l><hi>O may the living, by the dead be taught!</hi></l>
<l><hi>May here Ambition learn to clip her wing,</hi></l>
<l><hi>And Jealousy to blunt her deadly sting;</hi></l>
<l><hi>Then shall the Poet every with obtain,</hi></l>
<l><hi>Nor Roman and Rivine die in vain.</hi></l>
