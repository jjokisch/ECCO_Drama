<p>LUCIUS JUNIUS BRUTUS; OR, THE EXPULSION OF THE TARQUINS: AN HISTORICAL PLAY.</p>

<p>LONDON: PRINTED FOR J. WILKIE, NO. 71, ST. PAUL'S-CHURCH-YARD; FIELDING AND WALKER, PATER-NOSTER-ROW; G. KEARSLEY, FLEET-STREET; P. ELSMLEY, STRAND; W. DAVIS, PICCADILLY. MDCCLXXIX.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>Tthose who judge of dramatic merit from the Greek models, the rules of French critics, or the examples of modern writers, a justification of the following piece would be attempted in vain. They would call it a motley performance, deficient in almost every article, which constitutes a true and proper tragedy. If the author was to alledge, that he never meant to compose a tragedy, according to their acceptation of the word, but that his intention was to fill up a picture of real life, in a certain given time, the outlines of which were taken from historical facts, his reason would be deemed unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Regardless of the end proposed, they would continue to exclaim, that the unities were neglected, that the grave was intermingled with the ludicrous; that the business of the drama frequently stood still; that the dialogue was too familiar, and the metre little better than measured prose.</p>
<p>How far some of these objections may be valid, and how many more might, perhaps, with
<pb n="ii" facs="4"/>
reason be urged against particular passages, the author would not determine. The force of others of them he would endeavour to diminish, by answering, that they militate equally against human life itself; and that while he should be sorry to have this denominated an artificial poem, he would flatter himself, it cannot be justly thought an unnatural one.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson indeed, in the preface to his edition of Shakespeare, seems to have sufficiently vindicated this particular species of writing, to which, those who please, may (instead of tragedy) give the more simple name of history. Neither are there wanting many good judges of composition, who wish that the less studied diction, and more plain and level metre of the school of that immortal poet, (which seems to have ended with Southern) had been continued to the present time. Even this performance, with all its imputed irregularities and deficiencies, will, perhaps, be preferred by them, to those translated tragedies or imitations, which of late years have, through novelty, lived their nine nights on the stage, and been damned for ever after in the closet: tho' they had been corrected and metamorphosed by managers, calculated to afford to favourite actors or actresses opportunities of shining, and curtailed by lord chamberlains.</p>
<p><pb n="iii" facs="5"/>
A diversification of characters hath been attempted in this piece; and to give to every character the mode of sentiment and expression, peculiarly suited to it. It is not at all difficult for a man of a very middling genius, to contrive a regular plot, to pen down a certain number of sounding lines; and though his Dramatis Personae are distinguished by particular names, to put his own sentiments in their mouths throughout five acts. Had the author been solicitous of adapting his plan to the stage, or wished to conciliate the favour of the indiscriminating multitude, he might probably have followed the same method.</p>
<p>However it may appear to us, when we are reading, no small attention is requisite in written dialogue of any kind, for an author entirely to cast off self. This was the characteristic of Shakespeare; and perhaps after all, the author of this play hath deceived himself, and it may with reason be applied to him.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>VALERIUS.</speaker>
<l>YES, we may weep the ruin of our country,</l>
<l>And so must all good men; but there's no remedy;</l>
<l>The evil is too rank t' admit a cure.</l>
<l>Oppression wide hath spread her bane, and tainted</l>
<l>The universal air; scarce are our souls</l>
<l>Our own, much less our words. The secret curse</l>
<l>Is frequent, offer'd up to all the gods</l>
<l>The midnight silent deprecation calls</l>
<l>For vengeance on the proud, the imperious Tarquin.</l>
<l>But in the day each wears the face of loyalty,</l>
<l>Nor dares, so jealous are these groveling times,</l>
<l>E'en in his brother's bosom pour the secret</l>
<l>Which ulcerating preys upon his heart.</l>
<l>How we two thus have dared communicate</l>
<l>Our thoughts either to other, is to me</l>
<l>Most strange and passing marvel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIUS.</speaker>
<l>Had I not known thee long, thou noblest Roman,</l>
<l>Amid these worst of times immoveable</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="8"/>
In honour's steady course, invariably</l>
<l>Upright and just, in thy domestic life</l>
<l>Untainted too, I would not thus have open'd</l>
<l>My inmost breast, or given the passing wind</l>
<l>An opportunity to bear my words</l>
<l>On its licentious wing to th' tyrant's ear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALERIUS.</speaker>
<l>A mutual confidence henceforth be ours.</l>
<l>Scarcely can I express with what abhorrence</l>
<l>I look upon this monster of a man.</l>
<l>Scan the whole catalogue of horrid crimes,</l>
<l>And if you find one he hath not committed,</l>
<l>I will retract my words, and call him virtuous.</l>
<l>His brother first he poison'd, to possess</l>
<l>His wife; to gain the crown, assassinated</l>
<l>Most ruffian like, the good old king, by marriage</l>
<l>His father: I beheld the elder thrown</l>
<l>Down from the senate-house, his aged limbs</l>
<l>Bruised by the flinty pavement, his white locks</l>
<l>Which from the lawless robber would have gain'd</l>
<l>Respect and veneration, wildly scatter'd</l>
<l>Over his sace, defiled with clotted gore;</l>
<l>Raised from the ground with utmost difficulty,</l>
<l>And tottering t'ward his home, he met his death.</l>
<l>Still did insatiate cruelty pursue</l>
<l>His breathless corse, denied the common rites</l>
<l>Of burial; all men struck with horror, shunn'd</l>
<l>Th' accursed spot: yet then his savage wife</l>
<l>Drunk with hot draughts of empire, or possess'd</l>
<l>By the infernal furies, every tie</l>
<l>Of human nature cast aside, drove on</l>
<l>High in her stately chariot, and impell'd</l>
<l>Th' affrighted horses o'er him where he lay,</l>
<l>O'er the dead body of her murder'd father.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIUS.</speaker>
<l>Had I been told the fact, as perpetrated</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="9"/>
In any foreign country, my belief</l>
<l>Would have rebell'd. I wonder that the sun</l>
<l>Turn'd not his course, as at th' inhuman feast</l>
<l>Of Grecian Atreus: ever to reflection</l>
<l>As the deed rises in its native hue,</l>
<l>My blood runs cold. No wonder if his throne</l>
<l>Founded by means like these. should be supported</l>
<l>By the same means. Hence in what copious streams</l>
<l>Hath flow'd the blood of princely senators!</l>
<l>Their crimes were worth or riches; hath he spared</l>
<l>One, but whom absolute necessity</l>
<l>Compell'd, or mean opinion of his faculties</l>
<l>Suffer'd to live?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALERIUS.</speaker>
<l>To this, his cruel policy</l>
<l>He adds superior talents; with a soul</l>
<l>That penetrates mankind, he bears conjoin'd</l>
<l>The fiery spirit of the warrior God.</l>
<l>Talents by virtue guided, which might place him</l>
<l>Among the first of kings, but now serve only</l>
<l>To make him bold and resolute in vice,</l>
<l>And what is worse, create an awe, a dread,</l>
<l>On which, as on a base not to be shaken,</l>
<l>Stands fix'd high-towering tyranny.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIUS.</speaker>
<l>Yet we</l>
<l>Need not complain: us he hath spared; and me</l>
<l>While 'gainst the Ardeates he wages war,</l>
<l>In trust exalted to be governor</l>
<l>Of this fair city.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALERIUS.</speaker>
<l>Indeed, were life alone to be esteem'd,</l>
<l>We should not murmur; but to breathe the air,</l>
<l>To walk about at large, eat when we please,</l>
<l>Sleep at our will; this is not life—the beast</l>
<l>Upon the mountain leads a life like this.</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="10"/>
When I'm so selfish as to center all</l>
<l>My sense of pleasure here, when I cast off</l>
<l>Tender humanity, which feels, as relative</l>
<l>To all the members of society,</l>
<l>Joy or affliction, may I then be cursed</l>
<l>With such a life as this.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIUS.</speaker>
<l>Didst thou remember</l>
<l>Among the senators by Tarquin slain,</l>
<l>The name of Marcius Junius?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALERIUS.</speaker>
<l>Well I knew him;</l>
<l>But what of him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIUS.</speaker>
<l>Oh! He was placed above</l>
<l>The strain of men; his many virtues made him</l>
<l>Respected as a god by th' sons of Rome:</l>
<l>His ancestors came hither with Aeneas</l>
<l>From flaming Troy, the valour of his race,</l>
<l>Th' heroic ardor which inflames the breast</l>
<l>Of conscious greatness, and uplifts mankind</l>
<l>To something of divinity, dwelt in him.</l>
<l>He was a man, that had he 'scaped the wreck</l>
<l>Of those tempestuous days, would ne'er have suffer'd</l>
<l>Gigantic tyranny to take such strides.</l>
<l>At least some check he would have been, some curb</l>
<l>Upon the mouth of headstrong appetite,</l>
<l>And wild ambition. This our Tarquin knew:</l>
<l>And at the same time looking with an eye</l>
<l>Of greediness upon his large possessions, sent</l>
<l>And slew him and his elder son, a youth</l>
<l>Of gracious hopes; the younger being absent</l>
<l>Escaped the ruin.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALERIUS.</speaker>
<l>And now dwells with Tarquin,</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="11"/>
Lucius, the fool, the laughing-stock o' th' court:</l>
<l>Whom the young princes always carry with them</l>
<l>To aid their sport and jocund merriment;</l>
<l>The but, at which they shoot their shafts of wit;</l>
<l>Whose paucity of sense, and mode uncouth.</l>
<l>Aukward and blundering, hath deservedly</l>
<l>Got him the name of Brutus—But why waste</l>
<l>Our talk on this same ideot?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIUS.</speaker>
<l>'Solve the question:</l>
<l>I did but hint him, speaking of his father.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALERIUS.</speaker>
<l>Indeed, why talk at all, when all must end</l>
<l>As bootless as began?—There is a bound</l>
<l>Which checks, they say, all evils in their course,</l>
<l>And good ensues.—Our evils know no change;</l>
<l>Nor have they this extremest limit proved.—</l>
<l>Tho' that they should be in progression still,</l>
<l>Is past belief.—Yet there's no chance in nature,</l>
<l>No possibility of alteration,</l>
<l>No man alive to aim at alteration:</l>
<l>And his three sons, Titus, and Aruns, Sextus,</l>
<l>All equal to their father in ability,</l>
<l>Beyond, if possible, in the black deeds</l>
<l>Of villainy, of lust, and treachery,</l>
<l>Are three firm pillars added to the pile</l>
<l>Which threats to stand for ages. Oh! these thoughts</l>
<l>Are capable to banish moderation</l>
<l>From the prepared breast, and make the wise</l>
<l>Turn fools and madmen.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIUS.</speaker>
<l>Let us drop the subject.</l>
<l>Who knows the secrets of avenging Jove?</l>
<l>Perhaps though we, short-sighted as we are,</l>
<l>Think liberty bound in eternal thraldom,</l>
<l>His counsels otherwise decree: e'en now</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="12"/>
Haply the dread events are bursting forth,</l>
<l>Like light'ning from the gloomy firmament,</l>
<l>To sweep this race of hell-hounds from the earth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALERIUS.</speaker>
<l>What may be, I'll not say; but hope long since</l>
<l>Hath ceased with me to wear her sanguine hue.</l>
<l>Why should free agents e'en on Jove depend,</l>
<l>To sway the will he gave?—Man rules himself—</l>
<l>His own fate's arbiter.—Tho' o'er these times</l>
<l>Broods desperation, shall we not beneath</l>
<l>Her wings immew'd, this galling, tempting theme</l>
<l>Again revive?—Words cannot pluck the thorn,</l>
<l>But soothe the smart.—Farewel—I'll to my house—</l>
<l>Whither if in the evening you will come,</l>
<l>Still on a genuine Roman citizen</l>
<l>My Lares smile.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIUS.</speaker>
<l>I would attend unbidden.</l>
<l>But thy inviting voice should charm me thither,</l>
<l>Spite of disease or pain. At evening close</l>
<l>I come; then farewel.</l>

<l>Why, Aruns, in what corner sits the wind?</l>
<l>What! not a word to say! quite down i' th' mouth!</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>I am, and stranger, cannot guess the cause,</l>
<l>Unless 'tis living in inaction thus.</l>
<l>I would I was in Rome, or Rome was here,</l>
<l>Or that these coop'd-up Ardeats would but sight.</l>
<l>I wonder that our father sits contented</l>
<l>Lounging in's camp. Plague on their petty sallies!</l>
<l>Why doth he not attack the nest at once</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="13"/>
With fire and sword, and rouse up all the swarm?</l>
<l>It was not thus he triumph'd o'er the Sabines,</l>
<l>Or wrested from the warlike Volsci's hands</l>
<l>Suessa Pometia, with whose glorious spoils</l>
<l>Turning religious all at once, he built</l>
<l>The temple in the capitol to Jupiter.</l>
<l>Though had he ask'd of me, I could have told him</l>
<l>A better way of laying out his money.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>I do believe thee, Aruns, well I know</l>
<l>To what divinity thou would'st have rear'd</l>
<l>Thy golden altars.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Aye, and wisely too.</l>
<l>Pleasure's my deity, my Jupiter,</l>
<l>My Juno, and Minerva. Titus too,</l>
<l>If I mistake not, is no Atheist there,</l>
<l>But worships with as warm enthusiasm</l>
<l>As any votary of them all; 'tis true</l>
<l>He wears a graver brow, and commits sin</l>
<l>With a more serious philosophic face,</l>
<l>There's all the difference between me and thee,</l>
<l>A touch of feature only, in our hearts</l>
<l>We are most cordially alike.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Alike!</l>
<l>Why now indeed thy airy spirits dance,</l>
<l>Sparkling in either eye; but when I met thee,</l>
<l>What wert thou then? Inwrapp'd in discontent.</l>
<l>What wilt thou be anon? Chiding at straws</l>
<l>For lying in thy path; then quick, by th'sparks</l>
<l>Of angry passion, kindled into flame;</l>
<l>Still varying like the wind.—Thy heart like mine!</l>
<l>When didst thou find my skittish temper start,</l>
<l>And fly like thine from one to to'ther side?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Well, be it so, heaven speed us both! But Sextus!</l>
<l>I envy that same Sextus; for his genius</l>
<l>Soars o'er us both, and robs us of our birthright.</l>
<l>Not that I think, we halt behind him much</l>
<l>In our design'd intentions; but success</l>
<l>Befriends him farther, one would swear he kept</l>
<l>Fortune in pay, and that the blind-eyed goddess</l>
<l>Accepted bribes from him. There's not a woman</l>
<l>He looks on with desire but he possesses;</l>
<l>He says but to an enemy, Fall down,</l>
<l>And down he falls. Hah! say'st thou, is he not</l>
<l>A son of Tarquin, and a glorious villain?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Glorious I grant, but not a villain, Aruns.</l>
<l>Pshaw! that's a name may suit a vulgar mouth,</l>
<l>A tradesman talking of his brother knave;</l>
<l>But rank and station sanctify men's deeds;</l>
<l>A king successful, cannot be a tyrant,</l>
<l>Nor a king's son deserve a title less</l>
<l>Than that of prince.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Thou reason'st well, by Mars!</l>
<l>When I want oracles to be delivered,</l>
<l>I need not go to Delphos.—Out! Alas!</l>
<l>My blood's again obstructed, and I feel</l>
<l>A pain here in my head, or in my heart,</l>
<l>A sort of creeping kind of lethargy.—</l>
<l>Are you e'er seiz'd thus? Hah! here comes my antidote.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Brutus! true; he's a doctor for the spleen.</l>
<l>You mention'd Delphos; when we two went thither</l>
<l>Through the unknown seas of Greece, sent by our father</l>
<l>T'enquire the meaning of the prodigy,</l>
<l>The snake portentous, which with dreadful crest</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="15"/>
Appearing in his palace hiss'd aloud</l>
<l>A direful omen! Brutus then went with us.</l>
<l>Oh! I remember well the precious scenes</l>
<l>Of folly which he acted. When we gave</l>
<l>Rich presents to the God; He offer'd him</l>
<l>A walking stick; as if the god would walk,</l>
<l>And take the air, but that the god was lame.</l>
<l>Coming from out the temple, gazing back,</l>
<l>As loath to leave a place so fine, he fell</l>
<l>Over the threshold, and plough'd up the ground,</l>
<l>Fixing his face i' th' earth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>You may remember</l>
<l>The oracle too said, that he should bear</l>
<l>Chief sway in Rome, who first should kiss his mother.</l>
<l>When we came home, both at one time we kiss'd her.</l>
<l>In that I think we are at least before</l>
<l>Our brother Sextus, jointly we reign</l>
<l>After our father.</l>

<l>Oh! my good Lord, I had forgot indeed.</l>

<l>Yes, yes, all men</l>

<l>Says he, and smiled most graciously upon me,</l>
<l>For deeds of blackest and most treasonous nature,</l>
<l>Thy father and thy brother were accused of,</l>
<l>They've paid the forfeit with their lives: for thee,</l>

<l>Live in my house, companion of my children.</l>

<l>We need not now be nice i' th' definition</l>

<l>We shall be told what Tarquin and his sons</l>
<l>Have pre-determined: no small share of confidence.</l>
<l>As in the city they're the only source</l>

<l>What! know you not that tents have often ears</l>

<l>Across our path, beyond that farther tent?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HORATIUS.</speaker>
<l>Is it not Collatine, who lately married</l>
<l>Lucretius's daughter?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMINIUS.</speaker>
<l>Trust me, she's reported</l>
<l>The fairest, and the worthiest of her sex.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HORATIUS.</speaker>
<l>Fairer than ever was a form created</l>
<l>By youthful fancy, when the blood strays wild,</l>
<l>And never-resting thought is all on fire.</l>
<l>The worthiest of the worthy; not the nymph</l>
<l>Who met old Numa in his hallow'd walks,</l>
<l>And whisper'd in his ear her strains divine,</l>
<l>Can I conceive beyond her; the young choir</l>
<l>Of vestal virgins bend to her. 'Tis wonderful</l>
<l>Amid the darnel, hemlock, and base weeds</l>
<l>Which now spring rise from the luxurious compost</l>
<l>Spread o'er the realm, how this sweet lily rose,</l>
<l>How from the shade of these ill-neighbouring plants,</l>
<l>Her father shelter'd her, that not a leaf</l>
<l>Is blighted, but array'd in purest grace</l>
<l>She blooms unsullied verdure. Such her beauties,</l>
<l>As might call back the torpid breast of age</l>
<l>To long-forgotten rapture; such her mind,</l>
<l>As might abash the boldest libertine,</l>

<l>So warm, a stranger might form some conclusions.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HORATIUS.</speaker>
<l>I speak as an acquaintance, as a friend,</l>
<l>But yet impartially, not sway'd by passion,</l>
<l>But as I really think; had life's gay prime</l>
<l><pb n="16" facs="22"/>
Presented such an object to my view,</l>
<l>You would have thought me mad in my applause,</l>
<l>I should have flown above the shining spheres</l>
<l>Of th' azure vault for new comparisons,</l>
<l>Yet then not thought them hyperbolical.</l>
<l>I loved my wife; I praised her; but the height</l>
<l>I raised her to, reached not to this Lucretia;</l>
<l>Though since I've thought it much surpass'd the truth.</l>
<l>Here transport would have urged me far beyond</l>
<l>All sober bounds, and yet close by my side</l>
<l>Reason would have stood, smiling to see herself</l>
<l>So justly superseded.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMINIUS.</speaker>
<l>Such a prodigy</l>

<l>You are deceiv'd,</l>

<l>I don't see how, if 'twas his inclination,</l>
<l>He could do otherwise: but he possesses</l>
<l>Many good qualities, is gentle, kind,</l>
<l>And generous, wants not courage, and I know</l>
<l>Doats with the most impassion'd tenderness</l>
<l>Upon Lucretia. Haply 'tis in hopes</l>
<l>To ease his mind from the sharp grief of absence,</l>
<l>That thus he mingles with the festive train,</l>
<l>And joins the roar of idle rioting</l>
<l>And dissipation; though I ne'er observ'd</l>
<l>He join'd it heartily. I've seen him oft</l>

<l>How long is it, Lavinia, since my lord</l>

<l>And restless scenes of war?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAVINIA.</speaker>
<l>Why, in my simple estimation, Madam,</l>
<l>'Tis some ten days, or thereabout, for time</l>
<l>Runs as it shou'd with me, in yours it may be</l>
<l>Perhaps ten years.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIA.</speaker>
<l>And what should make thee think so?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAVINIA.</speaker>
<l>Nay, I know not; but I have heard folks say—</l>
<l>I think my grandam—yes, my grandam 'twas—</l>
<l>That she, when she was young, in days of yore,</l>
<l>And parted from her newly-married husband,</l>
<l>Found the whole method of time's progress chang'd,</l>
<l>Instead of wings t' his back, posting in haste,</l>
<l>And flitting by so quick, you could not seize him</l>
<l>By his lank lock, a gouty, hobbling wretch,</l>
<l>That noting of the pain he took in walking,</l>
<l>Gave sympathetic pangs.—She was a shrewd one,</l>
<l>And had, if I'd believe her, in her spring</l>
<l>Felt all the power of love. Oh, she could talk</l>
<l>E'en then of purling streams, and cooing doves,</l>
<l><pb n="18" facs="24"/>
And of the arms clasp'd thus, and brow bent thus,</l>
<l>Of aking hearts, and such a deal of stuff,</l>
<l>That had I not e'en from my tender years</l>
<l>Been guarded well by the superior powers,</l>
<l>I should have sought me out a swain and married,</l>
<l>And now perhaps been moaning for the absence</l>
<l>Of my true trutle.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIA.</speaker>

<l>What 'twas to love?</l>

<sp>
<speaker>LAVINIA.</speaker>
<l>No, I thank holy Vesta,</l>
<l>Never; I've cast indeed sometimes the eyes</l>
<l>Of approbation on a proper man,</l>
<l>But never sent deep glances; off they darted</l>
<l>From him upon another; O, my heart!</l>
<l>What 'twas to love! Why men are all alike,</l>
<l>All mothers' sons.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIA.</speaker>
<l>Thou hast a gadding tongue,</l>
<l>But still thy mind is right; thou hast no meaning</l>
<l>Affix'd to what thou utter'st.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAVINIA.</speaker>
<l>None to speak of.—</l>
<l>All that I mean, is, that if I were married,</l>
<l>And that my husband were call'd forth to th' wars,</l>
<l>I should not stray through the grove next my house,</l>
<l>Invoke the pensive solitude, and wooe</l>
<l>The dull and silent melancholy, brood</l>
<l>O'er my own thoughts alone, or keep myself</l>
<l>Within my house mew'd up a prisoner.</l>
<l>I should do like the rest of my sex, repair</l>
<l>To company and noise; 'tis for philosophers</l>
<l>To love retirement; women were not made</l>

<l>To brave the general and licentious eye,</l>
<l>To mingle with the fickle, trifling crew</l>
<l>Of merriment, who laugh aloud, if Folly</l>
<l>Shake but the cap upon her head, or lift</l>
<l>Her finger up before their face. The praise</l>
<l>Of woman is to play the housewife well;</l>
<l>Ambitious in her husband's sight t' appear</l>
<l>Grateful and amiable, not indeed careless</l>
<l>Of others, but preferring him to all,</l>
<l>And his society; not cloying neither,</l>
<l>But manifested in a way known only</l>
<l>To nice affection, and distinguished by it:</l>

<l>Covered with flags, well pleas'd to tend her children</l>

<l>What distant undistinguish'd noise they heard,</l>
<l>And having drawn in their brief chronicle,</l>
<l>And thereto added her own little journal,</l>
<l>With mutual interchanged looks of love,</l>
<l>Retire to rest unbroken? No, Lavinia,</l>
<l>The true delight, I'm well convinced, dwells there</l>
<l>With nature and her offspring; and if those</l>
<l>To whom 'tis giv'n beneath the cedar roof</l>
<l>High over-arch'd to sit, would relish life,</l>
<l>They must as far as possible pursue</l>
<l>Her paths unhackney'd, and must imitate</l>
<l>Her unaffected simpleness.</l>

<l>Ah, me!</l>
<l>I much suspect there are two natures then;</l>
<l>For ever since I was a tiny thing,</l>
<l>Not higher than this, I warrant, I have thought</l>
<l>Of nothing all the live-long day, but shew,</l>
<l>And glitter, and rich toys, and ornaments;</l>
<l>And I have gone to bed, and in my sleep</l>
<l>Have dream'd I had them; then with the greatest pleasure</l>
<l>Have waked, and wept full bitterly to find.</l>
<l><pb n="21" facs="27"/>
That I was disappointed. I must own</l>
<l>I have no notion of that other nature.</l>
<l>Give me things quite the ontrary, give me</l>
<l>To enjoy life, like I know who; some ladies</l>
<l>And those of the best quality in Rome</l>
<l>Possess a pretty comfortable share</l>
<l>Of that same nature I esteem the best.</l>

<l>Let others act as they think fit, nor let it</l>
<l>Be call'd in them a fault to please themselves,</l>
<l>In me a virtue.—But I thank the gods</l>
<l>Who made me what I am; who gave to me</l>
<l>A father whose indulgent tenderness</l>
<l>More than supplied a mother's loss, who died</l>
<l>E'er memory set her stamp on my heart's tablet;</l>
<l>Who taught me wealth was dross, and that the mind</l>
<l>Possess'd of conscious virtue, is more rich</l>
<l>Than all the sunless hoards which Plutus boasts.</l>
<l>Oft would he say, O, my beloved daughter,</l>
<l>I've tried (nor yet in vain) to set thee right;</l>
<l>To ope' thine eyes against the Siren charms</l>
<l>Of vanity, deluding womankind;</l>
<l>Act to approve thyself to thine own heart;</l>
<l>Despise the ideot custom, which breaks down</l>
<l>The fence which ever should remain strong built</l>
<l>Between the sexes: woman's chiefest glory</l>
<l>Is in retirement, and her highest pleasure</l>
<l>Results from home-born and domestic joys.</l>
<l>Hear me, Lucretia! so shalt thou obtain</l>
<l>The crown of woman, a deserving husband;</l>
<l>Who not a prisoner to the eye alone,</l>
<l>A fair complexion, or melodious voice,</l>
<l>Shall read thee deeper, nor shall time which palls</l>
<l>The rage of passion, shake his firmer love</l>
<l>Increasing by possession.—This, (again I thank</l>

<l>I should be glad to see this husband now:</l>
<l>These eyes are not the sharpest in the world:</l>
<l>Is not that he, gay as the morning lark,</l>
<l>And laughing with the sons of Tarquin there?</l>
<l>His heart is bent on mirth: he thinks not, he,</l>
<l>(Like other absent men) of his Lucretia:</l>

<l>Then I will say, I don't believe that lady</l>

<stage>TARQUIN, TITUS, ARUNS, SEXTUS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>TARQUIN.</speaker>
<l>MY glory, and my pride! my three bold sons!</l>
<l>Whom I rejoice in more, than in th' increase</l>
<l>Of empire and dominion! Where's the king</l>
<l>Can say with me, his children are his senators,</l>
<l>His judges, and his generals? while you</l>
<l>The first supply, I find they were as I</l>
<l>Esteem'd them justly, mere superfluous branches</l>
<l>To the commonweal, which I with prudent hand</l>
<l>Have lopp'd. For government can't be too simple,</l>
<l>Torn by variety of ranks and orders,</l>
<l>Action is lost in fruitless canvassing,</l>
<l>Empty harrangues, and vain deliberation:</l>
<l>While vigorous enterprize, amid the jar</l>
<l>Of bickering parties dares not shew his face.</l>
<l>No secrecy observed, the enemy</l>
<l>Knows well the bent of every expedition</l>
<l>As soon as plann'd, and as th' event's foreseen,</l>
<l>Prepares against it warily, and strongly.</l>
<l>Is this to be a king? Oh, only name</l>
<l>Of royalty! in fact a vassal slave</l>
<l>Tied down and manacled, condemn'd to act</l>
<l>Not from himself, but as by others tutor'd.</l>
<l>While some bold party swallowing up the rest,</l>
<l>Seizes the reins of empire, and bestows</l>
<l>All the offices of trust. He, flimsy shadow,</l>
<l>Titular monarch, cannot help himself:</l>
<l><pb n="24" facs="30"/>
But like a wretched fisher in a boat,</l>
<l>From which the sails are rent by the rude winds,</l>
<l>The rudder clove asunder, and oars lost,</l>
<l>Still rides indeed upon the billows backs</l>
<l>Born by the flux and reflux of the tides</l>
<l>At random, till despair and famine end</l>
<l>His miserable life, or the crazed hulk</l>
<l>Admit the briny wave, then both together</l>
<l>Sink in the deep, and ne'er are heard of more:</l>
<l>Who'd be a king like this?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>Who would, my father!</l>
<l>Rather would I betake me to the plough,</l>
<l>And till with utmost toil a land ungrateful,</l>
<l>A barren desart, where but here and there</l>
<l>A blade of corn would rise, and my whole harvest</l>
<l>Scarce serve to keep body and soul together,</l>
<l>Till the next year's return, Such servitude</l>
<l>Were not to be sustain'd, 'twere worse than death.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TARQUIN.</speaker>
<l>Still keep these sentiments, my son; they shew</l>
<l>The man, not the poor-spirited mean creature</l>
<l>That generally is call'd so, but the man</l>
<l>Born to command, to lord it o'er these earth-worms,</l>
<l>To sit in the exalted seat of empire,</l>
<l>And wield the sceptre; to be plac'd a god</l>
<l>Above the rest, as the gods are 'bove him.</l>
<l>Had I been guided by the moderate maxims</l>
<l>Of doating politicians, had I not</l>
<l>Acted on principles which my soul started,</l>
<l>And hands dared execute, I should have lived</l>
<l>Coop'd up within the walls of Rome, and call'd</l>
<l>Only that petty city, those few acres,</l>
<l>My sum of territory: have pursued</l>
<l>The canting superstitions of old Numa;</l>
<l>Or thought, with Ancus, that to build a bridge</l>
<l><pb n="25" facs="31"/>
Or thought, with Ancus, that to build a bridge</l>
<l>Over the Tiber was a wonderous work;</l>
<l>Or, like old purblind Servius, have recorded</l>
<l>Offices, ages, deaths, births, marriages,</l>
<l>And kept the public register o'th' state.</l>
<l>But I resolved to rise above controulment,</l>
<l>To seize the glorious substance of true majesty,</l>
<l>To be a king indeed; and men are not</l>
<l>The restive beings some have but supposed:</l>
<l>They on timidity encroach, but dare not</l>
<l>Look settled resolution in the face.</l>
<l>Habit makes even slavery easy. Hence</l>
<l>I turn'd my conquering arms 'gainst all the states</l>
<l>Around, and made Hetruria pale with fear:</l>
<l>Now may the proudest nation yield to Rome,</l>
<l>And own her its superior; hence I'm honour'd,</l>
<l>Dreaded abroad, and courted; hence at home</l>
<l>Absolute lord; and hence shall leave my children</l>
<l>A stable throne, which shall continue firm</l>
<l>To latest ages, if not wantonly,</l>
<l>Or foolishly, they deviate from my steps.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>May Titus perish, if he deviate wantonly!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>And Aruns, if he deviate foolishly!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>And Sextus, if he deviate either way!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TARQUIN.</speaker>
<l>I know you better each, than to suspect you;</l>
<l>Nor think that my example, or my precepts,</l>
<l>Have been so little view'd, or weigh'd so lightly.</l>
<l>Keep but you three together, in the band</l>
<l>Of mutual fix'dness, and you may defy</l>
<l>Time, and th' adversity of accident,</l>
<l>Or force of malice.—But, my sons, the reason</l>
<l><pb n="26" facs="32"/>
Of this our meeting; this strong city Ardea,</l>
<l>Like to a mighty mound, dams up the current</l>
<l>Of our progression; were but this our own,</l>
<l>The whole Rutilian state of course would follow.</l>
<l>The question is, how to attain this end?</l>
<l>Assault we've tried, and wept our hardy veterans</l>
<l>Slain in th' unequal task; their walls are high,</l>
<l>And in few places only they're assailable;</l>
<l>Th' inhabitants are numerous, and resolv'd</l>
<l>To sell their freedom dear; plenty as yet</l>
<l>Makes them high-mettled, and they laugh to scorn</l>
<l>Us and our strength. Speak each what you advise,</l>
<l>Whether again t' advance our scaling-ladders,</l>
<l>And strive with fire and sword to gain admission;</l>
<l>Or whether change our siege into blockade,</l>
<l>And starve them to surrender. Titus, speak.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>I see no reason here for much debate,</l>
<l>Or many words to fix determination.</l>
<l>Our soldiers with their late successless toil</l>
<l>Dispirited and faint; theirs with the contrary</l>
<l>Valiant and bold: again, th' uncertainty</l>
<l>Of being more successful than before,</l>
<l>The probability that we shall not;</l>
<l>Th' ill consequences if we make th' assault</l>
<l>In vain; all tempt me to dissuade from action;</l>
<l>To gird the city well, harrass the country,</l>
<l>Debar them from supplies, sap their high walls,</l>
<l>Wait till we gain a lucky time for onset,</l>
<l>Or deep-laid stratagem; this gives a conquest</l>
<l>Certain, tho' slow; and this do I advise.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Think not I speak through contradiction, Titus:</l>
<l>But I can bring as many arguments,</l>
<l>As cogent too, and couch them full as briefly,</l>
<l><pb n="27" facs="33"/>
Why we should not delay; in every sally</l>
<l>Made since that trial, they've been beat to th' gates;</l>
<l>This hath restored the courage of our soldiers;</l>
<l>And shame now adds a double sting to bravery.</l>
<l>Delay breeds relaxation in our duty.</l>
<l>The Rutili and their allies may join,</l>
<l>Hem us between them and the walls of Ardea,</l>
<l>Or march to Rome itself. Delay breeds danger.</l>
<l>I do not like delay; it is a word</l>
<l>I hate; 'tis ominous as the raven's croak;</l>
<l>It bears with it a cold and death-like sound.</l>
<l>Might I but lead the army once again</l>
<l>To the attack, I'd be myself the first</l>
<l>To mount the wall, and answer for th' event:</l>
<l>If not, let the events speak for themselves,</l>
<l>Or speak you for them who determine otherwise.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>Could I by sly imposture hope to win</l>
<l>This Ardea, as I did the town of Gabii,</l>
<l>I would again submit my back to th' scourge,</l>
<l>And from my father's cruelty, a suppliant,</l>
<l>Intreat the gull'd inhabitants; nor wait</l>
<l>His hint, by cutting down the tallest poppies</l>
<l>I'th' presence of the messenger I sent him,</l>
<l>To slay their leaders. If this could be done,</l>
<l>Or any thing like this, I'd not advise</l>
<l>Speedy assault, or to protract the siege,</l>
<l>In both of which I can espy no small</l>
<l>Degree of danger. Titus well advises,</l>
<l>And so doth Aruns. A small grain would turn</l>
<l>The scale in either's favour. If our father</l>
<l>Determine for th' assault, about it speedily,</l>
<l>I'll climb to the top o'th' wall as soon as Aruns.</l>
<l>If Titus shall be thought t' have better counsell'd,</l>
<l>I'll watch the turn of every circumstance;</l>
<l>And hard it shall be, if some dexterous craft</l>
<l><pb n="28" facs="34"/>
Suit not with th' opportunity which must</l>
<l>I'th' course of things present itself.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TARQUIN.</speaker>
<l>I wish</l>
<l>That circumstance may offer; if it doth,</l>
<l>I doubt not of thy ready apprehension.</l>
<l>Aruns must be o'er-ruled; he knows my temper</l>
<l>As little brooks delay as his, but ardour</l>
<l>Must yield to the necessity o'th' times.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Aruns is pleased, if every one is pleased,</l>
<l>He yields contentedly, is quite resign'd.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRUTUS.</speaker>
<l>Horatius and Herminius</l>
<l>And others the centurions of the army,</l>
<l>Came with me to the door o'th' tent; they ask</l>
<l>If 'tis your pleasure they should be admitted?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TARQUIN.</speaker>
<l>Horatius and Herminius may come in,</l>
<l>Let the rest to their tents, these two shall bear</l>
<l>Our orders.</l>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Horatius <hi>and</hi> Herminius.</stage>
<l>Say, Horatius and Herminius,</l>
<l>Whether you, either of you, know a reason</l>
<l>Of any force, why we should not block up</l>
<l>This town of Ardea, and by protracting</l>
<l>The time, render ourselves more sure of conquest?</l>
<l>With freedom speak.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="29" facs="35"/>
<speaker>HERMINIUS.</speaker>
<l>I have but only one.</l>
<l>Kept from their homes so long, the populace</l>
<l>Already thither cast a longing eye;</l>
<l>They had been taught t'expect an easy prey,</l>
<l>With speed to be obtain'd; I fear their murmurs—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TARQUIN.</speaker>
<l>Say'st thou, the murmurs of the populace!</l>
<l>Shall I be moved by th' many-headed beast?</l>
<l>No: if thou dost not know these truths already,</l>
<l>Learn them of me. The grosser herd of men</l>
<l>Nature hath mark'd for servitude, to bear</l>
<l>The yoke with passive neck, and walk in trammels.</l>
<l>Woe to the king, who gives a tittle up</l>
<l>To th' unsoul'd brutal rabble! He shall find,</l>
<l>When 'tis too late, and sorely rue his folly.</l>
<l>Stop a wild horse when he hath slipp'd his bit,</l>
<l>Stick close your knees, and make him slack his pace</l>
<l>At your command; guide him with gentle words,</l>
<l>And tell him that he should not throw his rider.</l>
<l>Who talks of liberty, he means licentiousness;</l>
<l>Let the fat soil put forth that dangerous weed</l>
<l>But one poor inch, and you shall see it rise</l>
<l>With growth gigantic, till it reach to heaven</l>
<l>And blast the golden firmament. He knows</l>
<l>But little of mankind, who thinks by mild</l>
<l>And gentle usage to exact obedience.</l>
<l>What follows? Mean opinion of his talents,</l>
<l>Contempt, then Discontent is quickly seen</l>
<l>To ope her muttering mouth, close on whose heels</l>
<l>Treads bold Conspiracy and rank Rebellion.</l>
<l>I know them well; fond of variety,</l>
<l>And novel change; bold where they see no sign</l>
<l>Of opposition, like the high-swoln tide,</l>
<l><pb n="30" facs="36"/>
Through every open gap they rush amain.</l>
<l>I know them well, the slavish animals,</l>
<l>Let them but see the sternly-frowning face</l>
<l>Of awful majesty, let but authority</l>
<l>Lift high her iron whip, and they will cringe</l>
<l>And creep before your face like spaniel dogs,</l>
<l>Nor dare to wag a tongue, or move a limb,</l>
<l>Or even draw their breath, or let the strokes</l>
<l>Of their quick-palpitating hearts be heard.</l>
<l>I know them well; they cannot bear indulgence,</l>
<l>It breeds corrupted humours in their minds,</l>
<l>And subtile venom, which would blast the world</l>
<l>Like the wing'd plague.—The murmurs of the populace!</l>
<l>Why let the populace still murmur on;</l>
<l>Like the vague murmurs of the empty gale,</l>
<l>They blow at random, and soon pass away:</l>
<l>You cannot trace the wrinkles which they made</l>
<l>On the smooth ocean's face; 'tis the fierce voice</l>
<l>O'th' ruinating whirlwind which must rouse</l>
<l>The godhead from his deep abode, and cause him</l>
<l>Display his angry trident.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Might I speak,</l>
<l>I would presume to say, Herminius meant not</l>
<l>Aught derogating from your power of majesty;</l>
<l>But from his real fears, and his good-will—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TARQUIN.</speaker>
<l>I do not think he did: but let him learn</l>
<l>Henceforth, if he will needs produce his reasons,</l>
<l>To produce better; nor dare tell a lion,</l>
<l>That he must not chace down his prey, because</l>
<l>A swarm of gnats buz in the path he takes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>There's one, ere Tarquin tells his resolution,</l>
<l>Whose sage opinion hath not yet been ask'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="37"/>
<speaker>TARQUIN.</speaker>
<l>I beg his pardon, and will ask it strait.</l>
<l>Well, kinsman Lucius, what is thy advice?</l>
<l>Shall we with speedy onset, or delay,</l>
<l>Subdue these Ardeates?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRUTUS.</speaker>
<l>Humph! humph!—No, no—</l>
<l>That scheme won't do—I have it here, but cannot</l>
<l>Express myself in presence quite so full</l>
<l>As I could wish: but e'er long time is pass'd,</l>
<l>I hope t'acquaint you with a plan of mine,</l>
<l>By which the greatest enemies of Rome</l>
<l>Shall sink before her; but as yet excuse,</l>
<l>If I conceal the principles I go on.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TARQUIN.</speaker>
<l>We do, and render thanks for thy good-will:</l>
<l>And, Lucius, when thy plot is ripe, acquaint us.</l>
<l>Full many a year have we experience had</l>
<l>Of thy sagacity in admonition,</l>
<l>And quick dispach in business.—'Tis determined</l>
<l>To slack the arm of war, and give it rest.</l>
<l>The sword be still; but let pale meagre hunger</l>
<l>Scowl in their streets, and let the torrid thirst</l>
<l>Parch them without remorse; extremity</l>
<l>Must conquer, and to that these haughty Ardeates</l>
<l>Must yield perforce. Be't yours, Horatius,</l>
<l>And yours, Herminius, to acquaint the people</l>
<l>With our resolves; tell them, that tho' 'tis slow,</l>
<l>Yet the possession of the town is sure.</l>
<l>Enlarge upon the riches of the place,</l>
<l>Which must be theirs, if patience be but theirs.</l>
<l>Quiet their murmurs, if they will be quieted;</l>
<l>If not, our will is fix'd, and dread example</l>

Its substance, its inestimable worth,</l>
<l>And true original intrinsic value.</l>
<l>The willing tributary love of those</l>

<l>I see no graces in thy towering look,</l>

<l>And treacherous air, thy sceptre sway'd in vain,</l>
<l>And grandeur dazzling fools.—Thou cursed sorceress!</l>

<l>And shook their snaky locks! Thou bane of peace!</l>

<l>This harpy pest, and chain her firmly there,</l>
<l>That she may ne'er embroil the world again,</l>

<l>Whom have we here?</l>
<l>Say, man of melancholy mood, what dost thou</l>
<l>Moping alone? Beneath th' umbrageous boughs</l>
<l>Of this deep wood, what secret wizard spells</l>
<l>Exert'st thou to enslave the struggling moon?</l>
<l>To make the wolves howl, and the shepherd-dogs</l>
<l>Start from their unsound sleep? To make the trees</l>
<l>Set free their earth-clench'd roots, the rivers turn</l>
<l>Back to their source, and the old bed-rid earth</l>
<l>Tremble for fear? Nay, do not think I view thee</l>
<l>With dreadful apprehension. Did thy eyes</l>
<l>Glance fire, as sure I think the rays are dim;</l>
<l>Thy mouth spit flames, as sure it never will;</l>
<l>Didst thou lead growling in thy right hand chain'd</l>
<l>Th' infernal triple-headed dog, as now</l>
<l>I think I only spy a pine-branch there,</l>
<l>I'd tell thee with unterrified aspect</l>
<l><pb n="37" facs="43"/>
Thou art my prisoner. Come along with me.</l>
<l>Dost thou draw back? What reason can'st thou urge?</l>
<l>Sextus expects thee at his feast to-night;</l>
<l>I am for thy appearance bound to answer;</l>
<l>I heard that thou wert here, and come to bear thee</l>
<l>Willing or not. Come, leave to-night thy love</l>
<l>Of solitude e'en in this place, and meet her</l>
<l>To-morrow morning if thou wilt and welcome.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>My lord, I am not well, I'm very sick.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Sick! and by what physician's wise advice</l>
<l>Walk'st thou expos'd to the damp evening air?</l>
<l>Hangs not the dew upon the dropping leaves?</l>
<l>And doth not Philomela, at the pause</l>
<l>Of every pensive strain, turn back her head</l>
<l>And wipe the trickling moisture from her wing?</l>
<l>Go to, thou art not sick.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>Indeed, I am.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Indeed thou art! thy hand: ah! ah! I know</l>
<l>A lover's pulse: rather a wencher's: ah!</l>
<l>Were I to beat the bushes well around</l>
<l>'Tis ten to one but up the hare would start.</l>
<l>There are three kinds of men, whom I have found</l>
<l>Most notable that way.—First your shy fellows,</l>
<l>Who hang the head, and if you speak to them,</l>
<l>Are blushing ripe immediately. Next those</l>
<l>Who shun society, and swear that man</l>
<l>Is a curst creature whom they cannot live with.</l>
<l>Thirdly and lastly, all religious,</l>
<l>Of all denominations. These three kinds</l>
<l>Of men, have all hot amorous blood, which tingles</l>
<l>Through every vein, and will not give them rest.</l>
<l>Among the second thou comest in point blank,</l>
<l><pb n="38" facs="44"/>
A mixture hast thou of the first and third;</l>
<l>Though were the gods to shake thee, thy religion</l>
<l>Might fall from thee for aught I know, as fast</l>
<l>As leaves blown from a sapless tree in Autumn.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>Dost thou then think it hangs so loosely round me?</l>
<l>Were it indeed bound with firm bands of brass,</l>
<l>And knit with pins of hardest adamant,</l>
<l>Whatever of religion I might have,</l>
<l>Were Aruns but permitted, soon he'd strip me,</l>
<l>And leave me naked as himself.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>I own, I have no notion of these tricks,</l>
<l>These ceremonial farces, sacrifices,</l>
<l>Prophetic entrails, truth-foreseeing birds,</l>
<l>Chicken who teach by hieroglyphic pease,</l>
<l>And all the holy jugglings, which our priests</l>
<l>Would fain persuade us owe their origin</l>
<l>To th' essences divine.—Wilt thou deny</l>
<l>That Numa's nymph Egeria, was a strumpet,</l>
<l>Who met him often in a wood like this?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>What profits my denying or affirming?</l>
<l>But say, is Aruns likewise ignorant</l>
<l>Of that pure incense which the breast unspotted</l>
<l>Offers to heaven; that fine ethereal fire</l>
<l>Which by the gods created first, and placed</l>
<l>I' th' human bosom, sed by the fair deeds</l>
<l>Of moral goodness, rectitude, and truth,</l>
<l>Flies upward to its native origin?</l>
<l>Hath he no notion of that holy instinct</l>
<l>Which bids us look with awe, t'ward the great Ruler</l>
<l>Of heaven and Earth? and of that conscious pleasure</l>
<l>Arising in the soul, when bending low,</l>
<l>In humble reverence, we pay homage due</l>
<l>To the prime Power of all? Who call'd us forth</l>
<l><pb n="39" facs="45"/>
From the abyss of nothing into being?</l>
<l>Placed us above th' unthinking grazing herd?</l>
<l>Gave to us reason, by whose power we stand,</l>
<l>Foremost of all his works, lords of this world?</l>
<l>Who framed the universe for us alone;</l>
<l>And, for our pleasure? hung the flaming sky</l>
<l>With all its glowing orbs? Adorn'd the earth</l>
<l>With fruits, with flowers, and herbs of various sorts?</l>
<l>Fill'd earth, and air, and ocean's womb immense</l>
<l>With subject creatures, who might yield him homage,</l>
<l>Or be to him for food? Hast thou no notion?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Plague on thy notions! Plague upon thy questions!</l>
<l>Think'st thou the gods high-throned (if such there be)</l>
<l>E'er heed such sneaking abject two-legg'd animals</l>
<l>As thou and I are? From our praise what glory</l>
<l>Can they obtain? Or from our first existence</l>
<l>What satisfaction? Speculative dreamers</l>
<l>May fancy things like these; but chief your busy</l>
<l>Crafty pretenders, who well know to soothe</l>
<l>The ear of ignorance, tell these curious tales.</l>
<l>They know to profit by't. The easy fool</l>
<l>Swallows their canting potion glibly down,</l>
<l>And looks on them as heaven's own oracles.</l>
<l>'Tis all a jest, a may-game, or what's worse;</l>
<l>Whatever knaves may teach, or asses credit,</l>
<l>Ease is the pleasure of th' immortal gods,</l>
<l>And interest is the god of mortal men.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>Easy 'twould be to prove, how ill they merit</l>
<l>The name of deities, who sit inactive</l>
<l>In slothful state, while chance, that is, while nothing</l>
<l>Governs the world, and turns heaven's hinges round.</l>
<l>To prove, that man is from contemptible</l>
<l>Far, far removed; that there are some of real</l>
<l>And undissembled piety, who feel</l>
<l><pb n="40" facs="46"/>
What they profess, and from these feelings teach;</l>
<l>Who in the exercise of their devotion,</l>
<l>Taste greater joy than kings have power to give:</l>
<l>Nor would for th' unlock'd wealth of the wide earth,</l>
<l>Offend 'gainst that fixt monitor within.</l>
<l>Easy it were these things to prove to ears</l>
<l>Of sober sense, and serious meditation.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Oh, mock me not! I am as serious</l>
<l>As father Winter, when the cold north-east</l>
<l>Blowing between his shoulders through a chink,</l>
<l>Brooding he sits, and rakes the embers up,</l>
<l>In his ill-furnished heart.—To prove it, hence!</l>
<l>Take it, ye winds! 'Tis my religion—hence!</l>
<l>Lighten'd of this, now Collatine and I</l>
<l>May talk together without quarrelling.</l>
<l>I know not what 'tis good for, but to make</l>
<l>Men sour, and splenetic: I'll ne'er speak more</l>
<l>Or for it, or against it. Pr'ythee, Collatine,</l>
<l>Forgive me, if in too impertinent</l>
<l>And bold a strain I spake in its defence:</l>
<l>'Twas irony, my friend, sheer irony,</l>
<l>I thank thee that thou didst retaliate;</l>
<l>I see th' absurdity, and bid a long</l>
<l>Adieu to it for ever.—Hold thy tongue.—</l>
<l>'Tis gone, 'tis hence, 'tis no where, 'tis a theme</l>
<l>For priests, for ideots: thou hast cured me quite;</l>
<l>I have no qualms, not one, away! away!</l>
<l>Adieu!—'tis well.—And now, my Collatine,</l>
<l>I pr'ythee tell me, nay without a jest,</l>
<l>In earnest seriousness, what dost thou here?</l>
<l>And what employ'd thy meditations</l>
<l>When first I saw thee?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>Wilt thou tell me, Aruns,</l>
<l>How I shall answer thee? for never yet</l>
<l>That I remember did I give to thee</l>
<l><pb n="41" facs="47"/>
An answer thou wert pleased withal; if grave,</l>
<l>'Twas mighty dull, if gay, 'twas vastly silly;</l>
<l>E'en answer for me, Aruns, here I am:</l>
<l>Look round; what say the objects which thou see'st?</l>
<l>What say the objects which thou left'st behind?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>The objects which I left behind, are good;</l>
<l>The objects which I see are good; all's good;—</l>
<l>I should not speak at all.—A camp, a wood,</l>
<l>A wood, a camp.—Why I might beat my brains</l>
<l>For ever, e'er rouse up one new idea.—</l>
<l>Thou art indeed a moralizer, thou</l>
<l>Canst pick a sentence out of every stone,</l>
<l>And make the springy grass on which thou tread'st</l>
<l>Thy monitor. I'm stupid; fancy with me</l>
<l>Is long since dead; to each external thing</l>
<l>I'm as indifferent as if they never</l>
<l>Fill'd up their corner of existence. Blessing</l>
<l>Upon the Powers above! who steel'd my nerves,</l>
<l>And blunted every sentient faculty,</l>
<l>So that in vain, they'd dart before my sight</l>
<l>Their flaming thunderbolt.—But what of me?</l>
<l>I from this time appoint thee my preceptor.</l>
<l>I have improved already, I'll improve</l>
<l>Still more, tell me thy meditations.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>I will, nor do I think, what I'd not utter</l>
<l>To all mankind. I wish with equal truth</l>
<l>All the whole world could say so.—I will own</l>
<l>I came not to the camp with my good will:</l>
<l>I have no quarrel 'gainst the Ardeates,</l>
<l>They never injur'd me, nor do I know</l>
<l>A Roman whom they did: but 'twas my duty,</l>
<l>I was commanded, and obey'd; where danger</l>
<l>Raged in the fight, I was not backward: thou</l>
<l>Canst witness for me, 'mid the foremost bands</l>
<l>I braved the ruffian Death.—My mind's my own;</l>
<l><pb n="42" facs="48"/>
My service is my king's. I own I pitied</l>
<l>Those against whom I fought; nor wish'd to conquer</l>
<l>The brave, the injured. 'Mid the roar of war</l>
<l>I long'd for peace, and when the fight was o'er,</l>
<l>I would have found it in my tent; but there</l>
<l>It was denied; if I gave up one moment</l>
<l>To short reflection, strait intruded on me</l>
<l>Shoals of your new-created officers:</l>
<l>Pert coxcombs, who in words flame in the front,</l>
<l>And stare each terror of the field i'th' face;</l>
<l>Though when in arms, half-dead, they only know</l>
<l>Each motion by report: these brother soldiers</l>
<l>(For such they scruple not to call themselves)</l>
<l>Worried my ears to death: I left the camp.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>No wonder: such as these disgrace the name</l>
<l>Of manhood; oft I've seen them pale and wan</l>
<l>Not dare to lift an arm against the foe,</l>
<l>Yet talk at such a swelling boisterous rate,</l>
<l>As they would equal our god ancestor,</l>
<l>And slay whole hosts alone.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>Quite discontented with myself and them,</l>
<l>I hither came.—I cast my eyes around,</l>
<l>I saw the labours of the husbandman</l>
<l>Destroy'd; I saw the smoaking villages;</l>
<l>A thousand horrid thoughts of misery</l>
<l>Struck on my mind; I heard a thousand groans</l>
<l>Of fathers, mothers, children.—I could not</l>
<l>Refrain from tears, I could not as I live,</l>
<l>To think that industry, and innocence,</l>
<l>And sweet content, and genial home-bred joy,</l>
<l>Should from their native mansions be expell'd,</l>
<l>And their possessors slain perhaps by th' hands</l>
<l>Of brutal violence; or doom'd to lead</l>
<l>A life not worth the name, the prey of want,</l>
<l><pb n="43" facs="49"/>
Of woe, of anguish; 'twas indeed with tears</l>
<l>I thought upon it, and each human glory</l>
<l>Faded before me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>'Twas most lamentable,</l>
<l>And melancholious; I could weep methinks,</l>
<l>At the relation, had I not sworn solemnly,</l>
<l>When some years since lost in the melting mood</l>
<l>I play'd the fool egregiously, ne'er more</l>
<l>To weep at any rate.—These are sweet feelings;</l>
<l>I lose a deal of joy, I know full well,</l>
<l>By not indulging them: but 'tis no matter.—</l>
<l>What a fine tale hast thou been telling me,</l>
<l>Of troublesome companions, dismal sights,</l>
<l>And soft compassion melting into tears!—</l>
<l>Think'st thou I can't see through all these pretences?</l>
<l>Once, but not lately, once, when yet a boy,</l>
<l>I felt I know not what of odd emotions;</l>
<l>The peevish, amorous, whining, doating god</l>
<l>Had with his arrow pierced my liver through.</l>
<l>When absent from my love; but not my wife;</l>
<l>I sigh'd, and groan'd, and shook my pensive head,</l>
<l>And sought out desert rocks, and nodding pines,</l>
<l>And murmuring streams to soothe my sickening soul.</l>
<l>And if a friend by chance had found me out,</l>
<l>And ask'd what ail'd me, Ail me, gravely said I,</l>
<l>I'm pitying the vices of the world,</l>
<l>And thinking of its follies; though myself</l>
<l>Was then a child of folly, and as true a one</l>
<l>As any she e'er bore; a woman's fool.—</l>
<l>But do not weep again: when these same wars,</l>
<l>These cursed wars, are over, it shall see</l>
<l>Its own true love again; yes, that it shall,</l>
<l>It shall, it shall.</l>

<l>Now may I die—</l>
</sp>

<pb n="44" facs="50"/>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>No false professions, good my friend; die say'st thou!</l>
<l>No, live; live while thou may'st;—we stand upon</l>
<l>A hanging bank fast crumbling in the stream</l>
<l>Of headlong time; if swoll'n by rains, or vex'd</l>
<l>By raging winds, perhaps an hour, a moment,</l>
<l>Sweeps us away; and shall we aid, ourselves,</l>
<l>Each fatal accident? Heap up a load</l>
<l>Upon our shoulders, doubling our own weight,</l>
<l>And plunging in the waves before our day?—</l>
<l>Likest thou the metaphor? Come then with me;</l>
<l>And we'll to-night laugh off these clogging weights;</l>
<l>So that at least we will insure ourselves</l>
<l>Some twelve hours longer; hence with discontent;</l>
<l>Why should we purse our brows up, when the hand</l>
<l>Of youth, would keep them smooth? Come we're expected;</l>
<l>Sextus will have no Nay; and go with me</l>
<l>Willing or not, you must.</l>

<l>The conscious wood was witness to his sighs,</l>
<l>The conscious Dryads wiped their watery eyes,</l>

<l>Here now he is however, thanks to me;</l>

<l>And pr'y thee, Collatine, in what array</l>

<l>His torch behind, so that thou could'st not see</l>

A fault in thy beloved, but hast since</l>

<l>'Tis well; I like thee now: and this I answer;</l>
<l>Now thou art gay, I will be mighty grave,</l>
<l>And much we shall not lose by th' interchange.</l>
<l>In sober sadness, this my own experience</l>
<l>Hath taught me; this is my opinion,</l>
<l>Of which I would not give a tittle up,</l>
<l>Though strait-laced Pallas should appear in person.</l>
<l>That women are most dear, delicious,</l>
<l>Inconstant creatures, artful, amorous,</l>
<l>Fruitful in schemes to please their changeful fancies,</l>
<l>And fruitful in resources when discovered.</l>
<l>Before assurance, and a tongue well-hinged,</l>
<l>They fall by thousands; a strait back, a leg</l>
<l>Well-turn'd, and nimble, cutting quick vaults well,</l>
<l>A lively eye, yet in their presence bending</l>
<l>As if o'er-awed; these, with th' aforesaid graces,</l>
<l>Will madden them by millions; from the girl</l>
<l>Who feeds on chalk, to the grave married matron</l>
<l>Who is so chaste, forsooth, she wipes her mouth</l>
<l>After her husband, lest the breath of man,</l>
<l>If settling there too long, should taint her virtue.</l>
<l>I use them as they are; their native passion,</l>
<l>I know, is love of novelty; however,</l>
<l>Others more subaltern, as love of riches,</l>
<l><pb n="50" facs="56"/>
Grandeur, and shew, may seem to over-sway it;</l>
<l>Hence, tho' they swear they love me wonderous well</l>
<l>After some little time, I know the gentle</l>
<l>And pretty creatures heed not the strict truth:</l>
<l>I know it is not for myself they love me;</l>
<l>So delicacy bids me rove again;</l>
<l>I please their darling passion, and am bless'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>This is the common cant; the stale, gross, idle,</l>
<l>Unmeaning jargon of all those who, conscious</l>
<l>Of their own littleness of soul, avoid</l>
<l>With timid eye the face of modest virtue,</l>
<l>All those who to the name of womanhood</l>
<l>Join dignity of soul, and innocence</l>
<l>Unstain'd by inward base desire; who flush'd</l>
<l>With triumphs over those they dare attack,</l>
<l>The weak, or forward, those whose lines of feature</l>
<l>Proclaim there's no resistance to be made,</l>
<l>Or those who spring obtrusive forth, and meet</l>
<l>Half-way the doughty champions; strait declare,</l>
<l>(And fain would make their shallow notions current)</l>
<l>That woman-kind are all alike, all arrant</l>
<l>And willing daughters of the game, and hoot</l>
<l>At virtue, wheresoever she passes by them.</l>
<l>I have seen sparks like these, and I have seen</l>
<l>A little worthless village cur all night</l>
<l>Bay with incessant noise the silver moon,</l>
<l>While she serene, throned in her pearled car</l>
<l>Sail'd in full state along.—But Sextus' judgment</l>
<l>Owns not his words, and the resemblance glances</l>
<l>On others, not on him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>Let it glance where and upon whom it will,</l>
<l>Sextus is mighty careless of the matter.</l>
<l>When to the moon we stray for similes,</l>
<l>'Tis to be fear'd, our wit is lunatic.</l>
<l><pb n="51" facs="57"/>
However, my intent went with my words.</l>
<l>Now hear what I have seen: I've seen some fathers</l>
<l>Who have with care kept up their daughters housed,</l>
<l>For no deformity of mind or person;</l>
<l>No, not i'th' least; though wherefore otherwise</l>
<l>They chain them thus, heaven knows: I have seen men</l>
<l>Who have these monsters married; pardon me,</l>
<l>I meant these extraordinary beauties;</l>
<l>Young men indeed, and novices that way,</l>
<l>And they at such a rate have doated on them—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>Sextus, no more, lest I forget myself,</l>
<l>And thee. I tell thee, prince—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>I tell you both—Great king of gods and men!</l>
<l>Why must we tongue-tied sit, and mute, attending</l>
<l>To brawls like these? Are these fit offerings</l>
<l>For Bacchus' shrine? He, peaceful god, delights</l>
<l>In other gifts; a plague upon you both!</l>
<l>If ye must needs rail thus, stay till to-morrow,</l>
<l>And to it fasting.—Collatine, think not</l>
<l>I discommend thy warmth, it is becoming.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Indeed I rate it high in estimation;</l>
<l>Fidelity in love is a rare quality,</l>
<l>And merits praise: but how much rarer is it,</l>
<l>And more deserving praise in married life?</l>
<l>Hold, Sextus, hold for shame.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>Why, pray, good Sir, may I not praise the wife</l>
<l>Of this same testy froward gentleman?</l>
<l>Her shape slender and delicate? her face</l>
<l>Breathing the air of beauty? her sweet eyes,</l>
<l>Their fire mellowly temper'd? (though I never</l>
<l>Beheld her in my life) yet why might not</l>
<l>My tongue, prompted by pregnant fancy, form her</l>
<l><pb n="52" facs="58"/>
A type of excellent perfection?</l>
<l>And from her person turning, (as I should,</l>
<l>Had I not been withheld by interruption)</l>
<l>Have on her many virtues descanted,</l>
<l>But on his cheek offence must quivering sit,</l>
<l>And dream'd-of insult, the abortive child</l>
<l>Of misconstruction, whose near-sighted eye</l>
<l>Discerns not jest from real?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>And would Sextus</l>
<l>Persuade me, that I am indeed so weak,</l>
<l>As that my brain confused, blends opposite</l>
<l>And sundry kinds of phantasies together,</l>
<l>Letting go all distinction? that I read</l>
<l>The acts and words of others, always contrary</l>
<l>To their intent? E'en think so, there's no harm in it;</l>
<l>I heed it not; jest on; I'll aid your humour:</l>
<l>Let Aruns use me for his mirth and laughter,</l>
<l>And Titus deck me with ironic praise;</l>
<l>With all my care I'll foster the mistake;</l>
<l>Nor shall my self-importance undeceive you.</l>
<l>But when you touch a nearer, dearer subject,</l>
<l>Perish the man, nay, may he doubly perish,</l>
<l>Who can sit still, and hear with sneaking coolness,</l>
<l>The least abuse, or shadow of a slight,</l>
<l>Cast on the woman whom he loves! though here</l>
<l>Your praise and blame are equally alike,</l>
<l>Nor really add the least, or take away</l>
<l>From her a hundredth minim of a grain</l>
<l>Of her true value, more than they would add</l>
<l>To th' holy gods, or from their state diminish.</l>
</sp>

<l>If that a man might dare to ope his lips</l>
<l>When Collatinus frowns, he, I presume,</l>

<l>I grant you that Lucretia is divine,</l>

<l>Yet will I say my wife is not amiss,</l>
<l>That is, taken as a woman; your divinities</l>
<l>Need not regard the duties of the house,</l>
<l>Their minds are too sublime: 'tis theirs to range</l>
<l>In quest of pleasure: pleasure is divine,</l>
<l>And mortals must not think to grasp at it:</l>
<l>Yet as a woman, could my eyes but reach</l>
<l>As far as Rome, I make no doubt they'd see</l>

<l>What! 'tis the sex: enjoying to the full</l>
<l>The swing of licence which their husbands' absence</l>
<l>Affords. I'll stake my life that this is true.</l>
<l>And that my own (ill as I may deserve it)</l>
<l>Knows her state best, keeps best within the bounds</l>

<l>The soldiers, without doubt, will see the change</l>

<l>Some god had wrought the miracle, would be</l>
<l>An holy lie, which they perhaps would swallow:</l>

<l>Thus 'tis we plan; and thus our favourite schemes</l>
<l>Are blasted in the bud; we travel on</l>
<l>The road of life; we cast our sight far forward;</l>
<l>We think we spy the goal, our eyes are fix'd,</l>
<l>And fancy gives us earnest of possession:</l>
<l>Meanwhile ten thousand, thousand accidents,</l>
<l>Each as minute, and imperceptible,</l>
<l>As the fine floating threads of Midsummer,</l>
<l>Obliquely cross us; small, yet strong as fate.</l>
<l>Our progress is denied; the nerves of action</l>
<l>Are firmly fetter'd; as with idle toil</l>
<l>We strive to extricate ourselves, dark night steals on,</l>
<l>We fall, and haply never rise again,</l>
<l>Ne'er see the ruddy face of morn: or lost</l>
<l>In fogs and mists rove darkling, till arriv'd</l>
<l>At where we first set out, we strive again,</l>
<l>Again are baffled by the sturdy trifles,</l>
<l>And sink at last fatigued, and quite o'ercome,</l>
<l>Into the arms of death. Sorrowful thought!</l>
<l>But yet in strictness true.—Come life, come death,</l>
<l>He hath not lived in vain, who so hath lived</l>
<l>To satisfy himself.—Poor argument!</l>
<l><pb n="63" facs="69"/>
In reason good, in practice weak.—For me,</l>
<l>I am not satisfied, nor will be satisfied,</l>
<l>Missing the mark.—Tut—This is woman's play,</l>
<l>Meer words, meer words—deeds are the test of man.</l>
<l>And there I fail; a pufillanimous,</l>
<l>Tame, indolent, vile driveler.—But cease, cease;</l>
<l>Can I command occasion? Wrest the sway</l>
<l>Of mortal things from the strong rule of Heaven?</l>
<l>And to my will bend the reluctant step</l>
<l>Of coy contingency? O you high Powers!</l>
<l>Into your hands do I resign myself.</l>
<l>Might I be used the humble instrument</l>
<l>To free my country, Oh, how bless'd were I!</l>
<l>If Rome must sink, if I must live in vain,</l>
<l>And die as I have lived, I will not murmur;</l>
<l>I'm nothing; you are wise, and just, and good.—</l>
<l>Yet why not seek Valerius? Heaven, and earth!</l>
<l>It is too late; here come the rioters;</l>

<l>We're trapp'd indeed,</l>

<l>I do not think so, man. What, though our wives</l>

<l>What, though they love dancing and jollity?</l>
<l>There are trim gallants at Collatia.</l>

What, though they love feasting and revelry?</l>
<l>Are they not feasts and revels at Collatia?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>But such a hubbub, such a monstrous din,</l>
<l>So wild a roar, I never heard before.</l>
<l>I could have sworn, the frantic Bacchanals</l>
<l>Were come from Thrace. The shrieks o'th' Sabine maids</l>
<l>When ravish'd, were not heard so far away</l>
<l>As this shrill mirth. I fear'd to pass the threshold,</l>
<l>And trembled for my head; yet it was well</l>
<l>That they were all together; for it saved</l>
<l>Our precious time. Yet do not triumph, Collatine;</l>
<l>Or rather triumph now, for now thou may'st,</l>
<l>Crest-fallen shalt thou be anon.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>For me</l>
<l>To triumph, were absurd; more sober joy,</l>
<l>Believe me, shall be mine. As for my crest,</l>
<l>I trust, a single fibre of the plume</l>
<l>Shall not be soil'd to-night.</l>

<l>We'll try that soon.</l>
<l>Whom have we here? Hah, 'tis our run-away.</l>

<l>How daredst thou leave us? What art doing here?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRUTUS.</speaker>
<l>Doing here! I was doing nought at all.</l>
<l>At yonder corner of the street I miss'd you,</l>
<l>And thought you turn'd this way.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>My witty Brute,</l>
<l>Give thee a possibility of wrong,</l>
<l>And thou wilt ne'er go right.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRUTUS.</speaker>
<l>I could not help it, 'twas no fault of mine;</l>
<l>I came this way, and deem'd that I was right,</l>
<l><pb n="65" facs="71"/>
Though baulk'd by fortune, I could not attain</l>
<l>The sought-for end. But will you turn again</l>
<l>Toward my house? Shall we not see my wife?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>Thy wife! without a doubt we'll see thy wife:</l>
<l>But not at present; some weeks hence or months</l>
<l>Will serve the turn: and in the interim</l>
<l>Take heed thou givest her warning of our purpose,</l>
<l>That she may be at home.—Now to our horses.</l>
<l>Come, hurry, it grows late; I'm all impatience</l>
<l>To place this haughty Sir, on an equality</l>
<l>With those he seems to mock: a little hour</l>
<l>Will turn the laugh, when he may dear repent</l>
<l>This fancied mastership.</l>

<stage>LUCRETIA, <hi>at work with her maids.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIA.</speaker>
<l>I thank thee for thy tale, Lavinia,</l>
<l>Though little heeded; it would raise my mirth</l>
<l>Sometimes; though now I could not but retreat,</l>
<l>To that which Clelia had before related.</l>
<l>And didst thou know the youth, my Clelia?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLELIA.</speaker>
<l>Full well I knew him; 'twas my sister's son.</l>
<l>Oft e'er he died, for he was long a dying,</l>
<l>I went to see him; oftimes he ran o'er</l>
<l>Each circumstance of his unhappy love,</l>
<l>And the cold scorn which prey'd upon his heart.</l>
<l>And when his cheeks were wan, and his fair eyes,</l>
<l>Which once the liveliest that e'er glanced the flame</l>
<l>Of ardent faithful passion, were grown dim,</l>
<l>And scarce to be perceiv'd; when his strength sail'd,</l>
<l>And in a low weak tone he call'd me to him,</l>
<l>Entreated me, if ever I esteem'd him,</l>
<l>To keep the secret from the cruel maid,</l>
<l>Nor offer his departed soul a violence,</l>
<l>By giving of her pain; then, with a feeble</l>
<l>And trembling motion, press'd my hand t' his bosom,</l>
<l>Till I was almost dead as well as he.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIA.</speaker>
<l>And what became of her? I think thou said'st,</l>
<l>She with remorse was seiz'd; and at the hour</l>
<l>Of midnight, starting from her bed, sought out</l>
<l>The grave where he was buried.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLELIA.</speaker>
<l>There she died.</l>
<l>I think, that with th' assistance of Camilla,</l>
<l><pb n="67" facs="73"/>
I can make out a dittie, which was framed</l>
<l>On that occasion; but 'tis melancholy,</l>
<l>And you have heard enough of woe already.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAVINIA.</speaker>
<l>Oh! for the sake of heaven, keep to yourself</l>
<l>Your gloomy dirge; remember, that my mistress</l>
<l>Lies all alone; she will not wink an eye;</l>
<l>Or if she does, will dream of them, and wake</l>
<l>In sad affright.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUCRETIA.</speaker>
<l>Oh, fear not, my Lavinia:</l>
<l>Though much I like these tales of native woe,</l>
<l>I have no superstition, and no fears,</l>
<l>Which will disturb repose. How thou art moved,</l>
<l>I know not; but to me, a pleasing calm</l>
<l>Succeeds these narratives of grief o'erpast;</l>
<l>And though I sympathise, when they are told,</l>
<l>It is a joy I would not be without:</l>
<l>For always, in my mind, Lavinia,</l>
<l>The soft delight, which feeling pity brings,</l>
<l>Though but indulged a moment, far excels</l>
<l>An age of wanton gay festivity,</l>
<l>Which the vague soul enjoys not while it tastes.</l>

<l>Welcome, these my friends,</l>

<l>Rather, fair lady,</l>

<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>This is, indeed, a wife! here the dispute</l>
<l>Must end. Henceforth, there's no comparison.</l>
<l>I could have sworn it was not in my nature,</l>
<l>To envy any married man his bargain;</l>
<l>Nor do I envy thee: but 'tis a wife</l>
<l>Of wives, I can't but own, a jewel pick'd</l>
<l>From out the common pebbles. To have found her</l>
<l>At work among her maids, at this late hour,</l>
<l>Plying the needle, is not strange at all,</l>
<l>When I have seen what I beheld just now,</l>
<l>(And yet I could not have believ'd e'en that)</l>
<l>But to be pleas'd at our rude interruption,</l>
<l>Not to squeeze out a quaint apology,</l>
<l>As, "I am quite asham'd; so unprepar'd;</l>
<l>"Who could have thought! Would I had known of it!"</l>
<l>And such-like tacit hints, to tell her guests</l>
<l>She wishes them away; this carriage causes</l>
<l>Some little wonder.—Envy! No—Yes—No.</l>
<l>I give thee joy, my friend; and yet her beauty,</l>
<l>Might in some men, raise envy; but I know not</l>
<l>What envy means.—Thou'rt happy, Collatine;</l>
<l><pb n="71" facs="77"/>
Thou must be happy, if thou know'st thy happiness.</l>
<l>What think'st thou, Brutus?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRUTUS.</speaker>
<l>Happiness consists</l>
<l>In thought, in thinking; that's to say, that happiness</l>
<l>Is ours if we are happy—that's to say,</l>
<l>We're happy, if we think that happiness</l>
<l>Is ours, then we are happy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>That's all true;</l>
<l>Or, that's to say, in verity thy words</l>
<l>Are truly wise; the cream of rhetoric,</l>
<l>And marrow of morality, is thine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>I must express my satisfaction too;</l>
<l>And glad I am, that our dispute occasion'd</l>
<l>This journey hither; if once Collatine</l>
<l>Complain'd of my ironic praise, his conscience</l>
<l>Must tell him I'm sincere, when I affirm</l>
<l>I think him bless'd beyond comparison</l>
<l>In such a peerless dame.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINUS.</speaker>
<l>Enough, enough.</l>
<l>The gods forbid I should affect indifference,</l>

<l>Was you not, Sextus? Yes, you think, perhaps,</l>

<l>Who, Sextus? Yes, I have seen such an one;</l>
<l>I saw him at the siege of Ardea.</l>
<l>I thought he was a soldier of indifferent,</l>

<l>I thank you; what you think me meditating</l>
<l>I know not: but both now, and heretofore,</l>
<l>My mind was in the camp. How wine could heat us</l>

<l>A Knave! a base-born knave! But if he doth not</l>
<l>Severely pay for th' insult.—Such a villain!</l>
<l>I offer'd him the value of his horse;</l>
<l>He would not part with it, not he: he would not?</l>
<l>But force perforce he shall. A slave—a traitor—</l>
<l>I'll have the horse, were there a guard around it</l>
<l>Of fifty thousand men, all of them knights—</l>
<l>Aye, and his head to boot.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>What, brother, hath the wind affronted you?</l>
<l>Talk you to air? And chide the passing gale</l>
<l>For blowing in your face?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>He had th' assurance</l>
<l>To reason with me too: but if I do not</l>
<l>Marr all his reasoning for the future, may I—</l>
<l>What, Titus?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Even he.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>You see me moved—</l>
<l>Would you have thought it? Such a paltry, base,</l>
<l>I'll-manner'd groom! A Roman knight d'ye call him?</l>
<l>A Roman hind—a vile unpolish'd hind—</l>
<l>An unlick'd cub—</l>

<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Say, who is this, my brother?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Who is this? He, there—what d'ye call him? Fabius.</l>
<l>A knight! a villain: but may all the gods</l>
<l>Lay on me all their heaviest punishments,</l>
<l>If he within these two hours doth not treat</l>
<l>The hungry worms! Nay, and I'll mount his horse,</l>
<l>The horse he loves so well; the horse he would not</l>
<l>Part with to me; I'll mount that very horse,</l>
<l>And make him prance upon the very spot</l>
<l>Where his warm corpse lies buried, and ram in</l>
<l>His earthen bed full closely round about him.</l>
<l>Then see who'll reason, who'll pretend to prate;</l>
<l>Then see—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Why what is this? I hear of Fabius,</l>
<l>Of Fabius and a horse, and threats on threats.</l>
<l>Be calm, be cool.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>I've not been in a passion;</l>
<l>No, not in the least: but if I don't make him</l>
<l>A fearful specimen of my revenge,</l>
<l>A lesson to be read with shivering horror</l>
<l>By all the knights i'th' army—If I do not,</l>
<l>Ne'er may my pallid cheek again be red;</l>
<l>Ne'er may my wrinkled brow again be smooth;</l>
<l>Ne'er may the flash of anger quit my eye;</l>
<l>May my whole visage ne'er regain its turn</l>
<l>Of native feature! If I'm not revenged,</l>
<l>May all the complicated ills of life</l>
<l>Assail me!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Oh, ye gods! how passion alters</l>
<l>The noblest of your works! And is this Aruns?</l>
<l><pb n="77" facs="83"/>
Is this the son of Tarquin? This the brother</l>
<l>Of Sextus and of Titus? Fie, fie, fie!</l>
<l>What, turn'd a woman! Had my wife thus raged</l>
<l>In impotence of words, denied a bauble,</l>
<l>I should not thus have wonder'd. Oh, for shame!</l>
<l>Had'st thou desir'd what thou could'st not possess,</l>
<l>I might forgive thee; could'st thou not revenge,</l>
<l>I might excuse this storming with thy tongue.</l>
<l>But when thou may'st possess what thou desirest,</l>
<l>And when revenge attends upon thy beck,</l>
<l>Ready to punish insult, why this clamour?</l>
<l>This idle ineffectual rhapsody</l>
<l>Of empty words?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Empty or not, I reck not.</l>
<l>I spake to please myself. Must I be curb'd</l>
<l>By every one? Not speak? Nay, Titus, stay,</l>
<l>You leave me not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS,</speaker>
<l>Then pr'ythee speak to th' purpose.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>I'll speak of this same horse, no other theme,</l>
<l>And of the base-born varlet who bestrode it;</l>
<l>A currish miscreant; but that's no matter.</l>
<l>Should one of Phoebus' steeds tire in his wain,</l>
<l>This would supply its place. A whoreson slave!</l>
<l>I ask'd him if he would exchange with me,</l>
<l>And bade him cull my stud.—The head so form'd!</l>
<l>Answering in nicest symmetry each limb—</l>
<l>Such harmony of shape! Such just proportion!</l>
<l>I ne'er saw strength with beauty so combined.</l>
<l>An eye of fire! A neck clad in effulgence,</l>
<l>And glorious as the arched bow of heaven!—</l>
<l>He told me, 'twas the only thing he loved,</l>
<l>His sole delight, his pride; ask'd me, if I</l>
<l><pb n="78" facs="84"/>
Would willingly give up the thing I loved;</l>
<l>Suppose my mistress; begg'd I'd not desire him;</l>
<l>Was sorry that he must refuse me; would I</l>
<l>Give him the best Italia e'er produced,</l>
<l>Nay, give him three for one; in brief, he could not,</l>
<l>He would not part with it.—Such a fine creature!</l>
<l>It ne'er was got by mortal sire; the dam</l>
<l>Must have been by the northern wind impregn'd.</l>
<l>The grass bends not beneath his feet; he's swifter</l>
<l>In his career than is a morning sun-beam;</l>
<l>And graceful as the wing of Mercury,</l>
<l>Sliding to earth upon an azure cloud,</l>
<l>The herald of the gods. A vital spirit</l>
<l>Informs each fibre, and directs its motions.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Enough, enough.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>No, it is not enough.</l>
<l>This horse is mine, it shall be mine at least;</l>
<l>I would not part with it for half a kingdom.</l>
<l>Poor, foolish Fabius! Little doth he think</l>
<l>My minister of vengeance dogs his heels.</l>
<l>When thou dismountest, Fabius, clap his neck,</l>
<l>Speak lovingly to him, as thou wert wont,</l>
<l>Take thy last leave, nor see the hand of death</l>

<sp>
<pb n="79" facs="85"/>
<speaker>CLAUDIUS.</speaker>
<l>Suspecting, as I think, my Lord, some ill,</l>
<l>And conscious of his just deserts, he rode</l>
<l>Toward the postern gate; I follow'd him,</l>
<l>Resolv'd to execute what you commanded.</l>
<l>Far off upon the distant hills appear'd</l>
<l>A band of the Rutilian foragers.</l>
<l>He both his spurs stuck in his horse's sides,</l>
<l>Gave him the reign, and mingled with them strait.</l>
<l>They shouted, wheel'd away toward the right,</l>
<l>And soon escap'd my eye.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Thou wert too slow.</l>

<l>Impossible! tut, there's a word: impossible!</l>
<l>There's no such thing, but in the vapid brain</l>
<l>Of fools and cowards. Why, thou sluggish varlet,</l>
<l>Dost thou not know it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLAUDIUS.</speaker>
<l>What, my gracious Lord?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Why thou art quite become the slave of humour:</l>
<l><pb n="80" facs="86"/>
Tetchy and froward as a squalling child</l>
<l>Of two months old; ever dissatisfied</l>
<l>Unless he feels the nipple in his mouth,</l>
<l>Or cries himself asleep.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>Oh, Heavenly Wisdom!</l>
<l>I see thy shining progress mid the stars,</l>
<l>Brightening the galaxy! To thee the orbs</l>
<l>Pay adoration from their lucent spheres!</l>
<l>Thou crown'st the everlasting fount of day</l>
<l>With dazzling radiance! Thou lead'st on the year!</l>
<l>The seasons in their varied liveries!</l>
<l>And, more than all the rest, inspir'st the soul</l>
<l>Of thy warm votary Titus!—Let me feel,</l>
<l>Oh, sacred goddess! but the faintest touch</l>
<l>Of thy benignity, and I will look</l>
<l>With such a gravity, an air so solemn,</l>
<l>As doth thy bird from out the hollow oak,</l>
<l>Circled with clasping ivy!—Oh, what pity</l>
<l>That I should pray in vain, who pray so seldom!</l>
<l>What then remains? To hurl a curse or two</l>
<l>At that blind strumpet Fortune, who takes care</l>
<l>Always to break my shins with her damn'd wheel;</l>
<l>To laugh in spite of her, a peevish laugh;</l>
<l>To wish all men no happier than myself;</l>
<l>To wish that I were such a fool as Brutus,</l>
<l>(As they are happiest whose sense is smallest)</l>
<l>Since I can't be so wise, so sage as Titus.</l>
<l>And so, farewel! I'll e'en go to my tent,</l>
<l>And try if I can sleep out this long siege;</l>
<l>For waking slumber is the worst of sleep.</l>
<l>And so, farewel!</l>

<sp>

<l>Farewel!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="81" facs="87"/>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>But stay, inform me,</l>
<l>If all thy gravity and wisdom knows,</l>
<l>Where Sextus leads his vagrant feet? Last night</l>
<l>I miss'd him. Privately, as I'm inform'd,</l>
<l>He left the camp; but for his destination</l>
<l>I could not learn it: know'st thou?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>No, I know not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARUNS.</speaker>
<l>I might have guess'd so; 'twere a thing as easy</l>
<l>To say when last Jove put on his disguise,</l>
<l>Slunk out at heaven's back gate, and what Alcmena</l>
<l>Received him to her arms. A plague on secret</l>
<l>Mysterious hidden letchery, I say!</l>
<l>Why can't a man be open in his dealings?</l>
<l>Give me the easy fair who will not blush,</l>
<l>Though the broad sun should stare her full i'th' face.</l>
<l>A plague on pains taking! Your fly intriguers</l>
<l>Are th' only whoremasters; all the rest are chaste,</l>
<l>And fornication is necessity.</l>
<l>Imagination must forsooth be tickled;</l>
<l>Your squeamish stomachs must be tantalized,</l>
<l>E'er they'll be hungry. Hence your amorous parlies,</l>
<l>Whispering from windows, squeezing of the hand,</l>
<l>Glances, the lewd interpreters of thought;</l>
<l>Hence all the monkey tricks, which e'en the woman</l>
<l>Who causes, laughs at—Foh! I'm sick to death—</l>
<l>Such worse than asses in the shape of men!</l>
<l>A pimping pleasure too, not worth the toil</l>
<l>Of stretching out an arm thus far. When Juno</l>
<l>Will be my paramour, I'll turn gallant,</l>
<l>Get me a pair of wings, and every night</l>
<l>Mount up to her etherial bed-chamber.</l>
<l><pb n="82" facs="88"/>

<l>And so, farewel! I'll to my contemplations.</l>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>I know thy contemplations well; beneath</l>
<l>That garb of chiding spleen, and discontent,</l>
<l>Ambition couches, though thou seem'st unsteady</l>
<l>As the vague moon; now, gay as Florio spring</l>
<l>Intent upon delight; now, clouded o'er,</l>
<l>And four as bleak December; rating i'th' morn,</l>
<l>What thou i'th' evening prized'st; yet the eagle</l>
<l>Looks not with eye more fix'd upon the sun,</l>
<l>Than thou on royalty. I've seen thee through.</l>
<l>And Sextus is not so enslaved to pleasure,</l>
<l>But that ambition claims the upper seat</l>
<l>In his aspiring mind. I've seen through both.</l>
<l>Three kings at once! no, that can never be.</l>
<l>One only bird arises from the ashes</l>
<l>Of the imperial phoenix; in the sky</l>
<l>There's but one glorious light. Let Tarquin die,</l>
<l>And these young scyons must not spoil the growth</l>
<l>Of th' elder towering oak; t' o'ertop their heads,</l>
<l>And keep them down, cannot perhaps be done;</l>
<l>They grow too quick. But still they may be blasted;</l>
<l>The canker-worm may prey on them in secret;</l>
<l>Or one good blow of a keen axe urged home,</l>
<l>In all their pride of foliage, lays them low.—</l>
<l>But peace! Sextus, I see, is near at hand.</l>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SEXTUS.</stage>
<l>Sextus, well met. What, you've, I'll warrant you,</l>
<l>From when the sun left his wave-quilted couch,</l>
<l>Full of anxiety and watchful care,</l>
<l>Been traversing the camp? How stand the soldiers</l>
<l>Affected to their duty? Dost thou think</l>
<l><pb n="83" facs="89"/>
Our ditch and palisades will guard us well?</l>
<l>And is the rampart strong in every quarter?</l>
<l>Or hast thou been a spy toward the city?</l>
<l>Keep they the guard o'th' wall with usual strictness?</l>
<l>Hast thou found out a weaker place unknown?</l>
<l>Or hath thy working brain yet wove the net,</l>
<l>Or limed the twig, or dug the fatal pit-fall,</l>
<l>For their destruction?</l>

<l>There is an hour for wine, and noise, and madness;</l>
<l>There is an hour for pleasure, and the feats</l>
<l>Which wanton Venus ever joys to look on.</l>
<l>Last night, my Titus—</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Was the hour of time</l>
<l>When Sextus—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>Pr'ythee take the fact at once.</l>
<l>Lay with Lucretia—Why that moon-eyed stare?</l>
<l>Lay with Lucretia—Dost thou understand me?</l>
<l>Lay with Lucretia—Need I to repeat it?</l>
<l>'Tis what my tongue could dwell upon with rapture,</l>
<l>Through th' infinite descent of rolling ages.</l>
<l>Let my eyes sparkling with the new-caught joy;</l>
<l>Let my cheeks stain'd with a more genial hue;</l>
<l>Let all the dancing transports which play o'er</l>
<l>My face; let these two arms which held her close</l>
<l>In twined embrace; let these two lips which kiss'd her,</l>
<l>Suck'd in her charms, and now still taste th' impression;</l>
<l>Let every atom of this body tell thee</l>
<l>That I enjoy'd Lucretia.</l>

<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>What, the wife</l>
<l>Of Collatine! thy friend! thy kinsman!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>The wife of Collatine, my friend, my kinsman;</l>
<l>Nearer related now indeed than ever.</l>
<l>But what, is Titus' conscience then grown squeamish?</l>
<l>Was it debauch'd last night, that 'tis so sickly,</l>
<l>So puling in the morning?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Not a whit;</l>
<l>But struck with some astonishment, however,</l>
<l>Lucretia! and the wife of Collatine!</l>
<l>By her consent too!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>Yes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>By some sly trick then;</l>
<l>Some damn'd insidious circumvention,</l>
<l>Some dark thick plot, some artifice close-couch'd,</l>
<l>Of cunning stratagem; or else through fear</l>
<l>Of some worse ill than death. Say now, how was it?</l>
<l>For if there ever was among the sex,</l>
<l>Or purity, or innocence, 'twas there.</l>
<l>She could not be a hypocrite; her face,</l>
<l>Her look, her outward manners, spake a heart</l>
<l>Unknowing of deceit; a soul of honour,</l>
<l>Where frozen chastity had fix'd her feat,</l>
<l>And unpolluted nuptial sanctity.</l>
<l>I do suspect thee much; 'tis but a boast,</l>
<l>Or else an act of low, of mean revenge,</l>
<l>To blast that virtue, which thy utmost efforts</l>
<l>Can ne'er subdue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>Sextus is wont to boast</l>
<l><pb n="85" facs="91"/>
Of favours which he ne'er received, or take</l>
<l>A pleasure in thin unsubstantial mischief.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>No; I acquit thee there.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>E'en as thou wilt.</l>
<l>But I suspect shrewdly thou enviest me:</l>
<l>Which more to raise: know that this soul of honour,</l>
<l>This piece of unthaw'd snow, this pattern rare</l>
<l>Of nuptial purity, I found to be</l>
<l>A woman; found her all alone, at midnight;</l>
<l>Found her in bed, undress'd, found her reluctant,</l>
<l>Found her, indeed, chaste to outrageousness,</l>
<l>(Tho' that but added fuel to the flame)</l>
<l>Yet used no violence, and yet enjoy'd her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Thou talk'st in riddles.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>Hear then the plain truth.</l>
<l>Now two nights since, when first we saw Lucretia,</l>
<l>Her air, her voice, her look, her every motion,</l>
<l>Inkindled passion in me e'en to madness.</l>
<l>Thou dost remember how my soul was buried</l>
<l>In senselessness to every object round;</l>
<l>Though then, perhaps, thou didst not guess the cause.</l>
<l>I swore then to possess her. All that evening</l>
<l>She unadvisedly with new incentives</l>
<l>Stirr'd up my purpose; but quite unresolved</l>
<l>How to pursue that purpose, I last night</l>
<l>Again went thither, only one attendant</l>
<l>Accompanied me; business of importance</l>
<l>Feign'd for my quick return. Her husband's friend,</l>
<l>And Tarquin's son, she could not but receive</l>
<l>A nightly guest; yet in her eye, methought,</l>
<l>She bore no great good-will to Tarquin's son.</l>
<l><pb n="86" facs="92"/>
She, without doubt, had heard his character,</l>
<l>And hard 'twas to dissemble. I nought heeded</l>
<l>This air of coldness, but with sage discourse,</l>
<l>And temperate, entertain'd her; talk'd of modesty,</l>
<l>Of self-denying virtue, of strict honour,</l>
<l>And mutual holy faith 'twixt man and man;</l>
<l>Of wedlock's happy league, and the young brood</l>
<l>Of smiling innocents: then turn'd my talk</l>
<l>To battles, sieges, dreadful deeds of arms,</l>
<l>Adventures rare, by martial prowess won:</l>
<l>A subject, to the which all woman-kind,</l>
<l>Open a greedy ear; but not a word</l>
<l>Of love, nor yet a sally of loose thought</l>
<l>Escap'd me; thus I fell in with her humour,</l>
<l>And, unsuspecting, she retired to rest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>And whither thou? But I'll not interrupt thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>Now was the depth of midnight; silence reign'd</l>
<l>Through all the house; not the least sound was there;</l>
<l>You might have heard a feather fall to the ground;</l>
<l>And sleep on every brow had fix'd his dead</l>
<l>And leaden hand, as Nature lent her aid</l>
<l>To my design. Kind Nature lent her aid,</l>
<l>Nor I refus'd the call: with cautious tread,</l>
<l>Suppose thou seest me entering the room,</l>
<l>Where lay that sleepy Venus; in one hand</l>
<l>My sword, a lamp in th' other; think thou seest me</l>
<l>Reading her naked charms; think (but thou canst not,</l>
<l>It is impossible, had'st thou not seen her)</l>
<l>What I then felt; my soul was all on fire,</l>
<l>My limbs all trembled; and my salient heart</l>
<l>Beat, as 'twould find a passage through my ribs.</l>
<l>Half between sleep and wake, Lucretia cries,</l>
<l>Art come, my lord? But, when she thoroughly waked,</l>
<l>What a wild look of horror and surprize!</l>
<l><pb n="87" facs="93"/>
She knew my purpose well; or, if she did not,</l>
<l>I kept her not in long suspence, nor wasted</l>
<l>The time in vain apology; my sword</l>
<l>Threatened her instant death, without compliance;</l>
<l>And, willingly, she cried, yes, willingly,</l>
<l>I'll die ten thousand deaths; Oh, my dear lord!</l>
<l>Where, where art thou; Oh, Sextus! I conjure thee</l>
<l>By every sacred, every tender name,</l>
<l>Make me not despicable to myself,</l>
<l>But slay me, and I'll thank thee.—All, that feeling</l>
<l>Passionate nature could suggest, she utter'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>And didst thou still proceed? Didst thou not find</l>
<l>Thy bosom mov'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEXTUS.</speaker>
<l>I did, but with desire.</l>
<l>For fear, had from her every other thought</l>
<l>Remov'd, her hair dishevel'd, hid but loosely</l>
<l>Her blaze of beauties, as she kneeling strove</l>
<l>To clasp my knees; I rais'd her and embraced;</l>
<l>She shriek'd aloud; fearing she might awake</l>
<l>The menial train, I had but one resource:</l>
<l>I rush'd forth to the door, where I had placed</l>
<l>My trusty slave, and dragging him by 's locks,</l>
<l>Swore I would slay them both upon her bed,</l>
<l>And publish to the world, I caught them there</l>
<l>I'th' act of shame: she found resistance vain;</l>
<l>The conflict 'twixt the dread of public infamy</l>
<l>And private crime, inwrapp'd her in despair;</l>
<l>I mark'd the strugglings of her soul, and seiz'd</l>
<l>The joy she would, but dared not to refuse.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITUS.</speaker>
<l>Thus having spoke, forever hold thy tongue.</l>
<l>My breast is not cast in that tender mould,</l>
<l>Strongly to feel the goadings of compunction:</l>
<l>Nor have I dealt in those punctilious niceties,</l>
<l><pb n="88" facs="94"/>
Which bind the vulgar. But this act of thine,</l>
<l>Almost calls up the water in my eye,</l>
<l>And raises new emotions in my heart:</l>
<l>For her, I'm touch'd with pity; and on thee,</l>
<l>I look with something tending toward horror.</l>
<l>Oh, hold thy tongue! ne'er mention what thou'st done,</l>
<l>Lest that the very earth, on which thou tread'st,</l>
<l>Cry out against thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>This rebuke from thee!</l>
<l>This to a stranger urge, to him who knows thee not.</l>
<l>And he may be deceived. I can't but laugh,</l>
<l>When I behold hypocrisy array'd</l>
<l>In th' unbecoming robe she stole from virtue,</l>
<l>Not hiding half her nakedness. Come, swear</l>
<l>By all the gods, and gulp down th' perjury,</l>
<l>That all thy life hath been inculpable,</l>
<l>That thou hast never broke the chains of wedlock,</l>
<l>Nor ever wilt; and then, to prove thy truth,</l>
<l>Lust after the next Roman dame thou seest,</l>

<l>No future perils from this bold effect</l>
<l>Of unrestrain'd desire? Compell'd to suffer</l>

May she not to her husband, or her father,</l>

<l>What then, thou think'st her something super-human!</l>
<l>Did I not tell thee that she was a woman?</l>
<l>And on my life, she'll act like any woman:</l>
<l>With words like these, she'll lull her frantic rage,</l>
<l>And puff the depth of her despair away.</l>
<l>'Tis done, and can't be undone; 'tis not known;</l>
<l>So there's no harm; guilt is no guilt in secret:</l>
<l>Why should I make myself a wretch by blabbing?</l>
<l>Why tell my husband what he can't find out?</l>
<l>Sextus must love me wonderfully well,</l>
<l>Or he would ne'er have undergone this hazard;</l>
<l>No marvel though, when beauty, such as mine,</l>
<l>Enticed him; then she looks upon her mirrour,</l>
<l>Vanity shews her figure passing fair,</l>
<l>She smiles, and thus proceeds; beauteous as ever:</l>
<l>Why, what a peevish thing this virtue is!</l>
<l>And Sextus is a prince; and what is Collatine?</l>
<l>(Now comes she, mark me, to comparisons)</l>
<l>What's Collatine? A private man. Ambition</l>
<l>Now flits before her eyes, and she is blinded:</l>
<l>To hold the prince a captive in her chains!</l>
<l>Grandeur is hers, and pomp, and dignity,</l>
<l>And all the world holds dear and precious.</l>
<l>Oh, your strong-working passions ne'er last long!</l>
<l>She cool'd e'er I had mounted on my horse;</l>
<l>E'er I had rode ten paces, she saw things</l>
<l>In the same light which I have represented.</l>
<l>And now, no longer coy, reserv'd, and stubborn,</l>
<l>Sends off a messenger t' invite me back;</l>
<l>Oh, I shall riot after this, my Titus,</l>

<l>Vain-glorious boaster! that could'st not conceal</l>
<l>Thy treasure, but rather than not be known</l>
<l>To be possess'd of wealth, must take the thief,</l>
<l>The first notorious thief thou met'st, and shew him</l>

<speaker>FIRST CITIZEN.</speaker>
<l>I Told you how this melancholy sight,</l>
<l>The history of the deed shewn in its true</l>
<l>And native colours, by th' afflicted husband</l>
<l>And father, with the artless eloquence</l>
<l>Of real grief; how the discovery</l>
<l>Of Brutus, and his speech, affected us.</l>
<l>Each braver youth stood quickly by their side</l>
<l>Array'd in arms, burning with indignation</l>
<l>Pent in their breasts. We left Collatia</l>
<l>And enter'd Rome; a sight so new and strange,</l>
<l>With the arm'd multitude, first struck th' inhabitants</l>
<l>With fear and terror: but when they beheld</l>
<l>The order of our march, peaceful and solemn,</l>
<l>They soon put off their fears, and throng'd to gaze</l>
<l>Undress'd, unornamented, on her bier</l>
<l>Lay, scarce yet cold, Lucretia's chaste remains,</l>
<l>Beauteous in death: you might have ta'en her so,</l>
<l>And placed her in a temple, 'twould be sworn</l>
<l>'Twas Venus' image cut in alabaster.</l>
<l>Or for her hair confusedly scatter'd over</l>
<l>Her comely face and neck, Dian, reclined</l>
<l>After her toil upon a mount, exposed</l>
<l>To the rude winds; while in her breast the wound</l>
<l>She gave herself, would cause you to admire</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FIRST CITIZEN.</speaker>
<l>They must by this have well-nigh reach'd the forum;</l>
<l>Where Brutus, who is tribune of the guards,</l>
<l>(A place of trust, which Tarquin only gave him,</l>
<l>As he appear'd an object of contempt)</l>
<l>Hath call'd together all the centuries.</l>
<l>He and Valerius are mean time to meet</l>
<l>The snators, who are by this convened,</l>
<l>(The few whom Tarquin's sword hath left alive)</l>
<l>To lay before them his intent, his plans,</l>
<l>And to be guided by their wise advice;</l>
<l>While in the forum, with Lucretia's corse</l>
<l>Laid forth to view, the father and the husband</l>
<l>Relate the manner of her death; when this</l>
<l>Is finish'd, Brutus shall harangue the people.</l>

<l>Great matters, as I think, may rise from this,</l>

<l>Was there a probability shewn to me</l>

Doom'd, like these two, to death, because with grief</l>

<l>You're partners with her father and her husband,</l>
<l>In guilty sorrow. You have listen'd too</l>
<l>To me, a wretch, who twenty lingering years,</l>

<l>The entreaties of her friends, her weeping father</l>
<l>Begging, as he'd extort a gift from heaven,</l>
<l>Not all her husband's tender supplication,</l>
<l>Could shake her purpose: with a fearful hand,</l>
<l>But an undaunted soul: a woman's feelings,</l>
<l>But more than manly thought, deep in her breast</l>
<l>She plung'd this sharp-edged steel, which set her free.</l>
<l>Yes, thou art free, Lucretia! thou art gone,</l>

<l>To shrink each hour at sight of some new murder,</l>

<l>To work in sewers all day, shut up mid damps,</l>

Denied the sight of heaven's blessed sun,</l>

<l>To see his sons rush into every house,</l>
<l>To see our wives ravish'd before our eyes;</l>
<l>To see each ripening tender maid deflower'd;</l>
<l>To see them kill themselves; to see their pale,</l>
<l>And ashy corses, in the public forum,</l>
<l>Ranged all arow—Yet then we are determined</l>
<l>To bless kind Tarquin, mercy-loving Tarquin,</l>
<l>And beg him to beget some dozen more</l>
<l>Of sturdy sons, with such like acts of kindness,</l>
<l>To bless his humble, faithful citizens.</l>
<l>If this were not your fix'd determination,</l>
<l>Say, would you seek instructions? Would you ask</l>
<l>What you should do? Ask ye yon conscious walls,</l>
<l>Which saw his poison'd brother, saw the incest</l>

<l>Ask ye yon conscious street, where Tullia drove</l>
<l>O'er her dead father's corse, 'twill cry, Revenge!</l>
<l>Ask yonder senate house, whose stones are purple</l>

<l>Go to the tomb where lies his murder'd wife,</l>
<l>And the poor queen, who lov'd him as her son,</l>
<l>Their unappeased ghosts will shriek, Revenge!</l>
<l>The temples of the gods, th' all-viewing heavens,</l>

Lo, here I stand, helpless, and destitute,</l>
<l>Imploring pity only, where I ought</l>
<l>To claim obedience; prayers are th' arms I use,</l>
<l>Does this bespeak a tyrant?—See these locks,</l>
<l>Grey with the cares of government! these rather</l>
<l>Bespeak the father. I have govern'd you</l>
<l>For five and twenty years, during which time</l>
<l>I've fought your battles 'gainst your enemies,</l>
<l>From whom you have return'd with honour crown'd,</l>
<l>Loaded with spoils. I'm cover'd o'er with scars,</l>
<l>For you received; for ill doth he deserve</l>
<l>The name of royalty, who braves not peril,</l>
<l>Who shrinks affrighted at the frown of death,</l>
<l>Yet tells his subjects he's not terrible,</l>
<l>And bids them meet the fury face to face.</l>
<l>For you, and for your glory, hath my life</l>
<l>Been still employ'd, I'm wearied out with toil</l>
<l>Endured for you. To raise your name abroad,</l>
<l>And make each kingdom round you mention Rome,</l>
<l>And what belongs to Rome with awe—All this</l>
<l>I've done for you. For you have borne the frost</l>
<l>Of keen December, and for you sustain'd</l>
<l>The torrid dog-star. Have I ever hoarded</l>
<l>My share o'th' plunder? Fill'd my treasury</l>
<l>With stuff which I despised, but as it served</l>
<l>To add to Rome new lustre?—Look behind you!</l>
<l>Are not for you these sumptuous buildings rais'd?</l>
<l>And for your honour? Let the gods themselves</l>
<l>Declare my motives, who now dwell in temples</l>
<l>Fitting their dignity, and Rome's magnificence.</l>
<l>For which of these my works am I exiled?</l>
<l>Oh, you have been deceived, grossly deceived!</l>

<l>A suppliant's prayers, or in his wrath remember'd</l>
<l>Sweet mercy, asking pity of a people,</l>
<l>Whom he hath ever harrass'd with oppression?</l>
<l>Their glory didst thou seek? No, 'twas thy own,</l>
<l>Proud man. Hadst thou thy people's glory sought,</l>
<l>Or hadst thou truly known wherein thy own</l>
<l>Consisted, thou would'st have desired to see them</l>
<l>Happy and free. What glory e'er did slaves</l>
<l>Receive from conquest? Or what happiness</l>
<l>Can slaves enjoy, seeing a splendid palace</l>
<l>Or gorgeous temple?—While within the heart</l>
<l>Freedom sits not inthron'd, and in that shrine,</l>
<l>Where heaven's pure flame should dwell, lurks discontent,</l>
<l>And struggling, though depress'd, the generous ardor</l>
<l>They from their ancestors inherited,</l>
<l>What Roman is alive to any thought</l>
<l>But one, the secret wish of righteous vengeance?</l>
<l>Retire, false wretch, odious to gods and men,</l>

<l>Blessed inhabitants</l>
<l>Of Gabii! Oh, ye gods, your ways are just!</l>
<l>Now will I sit me down, and try to bear</l>
<l>Hateful old age, th' affliction of mortality,</l>
<l>But hastening on its remedy and cure.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>COLLATINE.</speaker>
<l>Yet I regret the villain should be slain</l>
<l>By any hand but mine.</l>

<stage><pb n="139" facs="145"/><hi>Enter</hi> CLAUDIUS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CLAUDIUS.</speaker>
<l>Is Brutus here?</l>
<l>My business is with him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRUTUS.</speaker>
<l>Another messenger!</l>
<l>I know thee well; disclose thy errand strait.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLAUDIUS</speaker>
<l>I come from Aruns; what he bade me utter,</l>
<l>If liberty of speech be granted me,</l>
<l>I shall deliver.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRUTUS.</speaker>
<l>Speak; thy words are free.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLAUDIUS.</speaker>
<l>Then thus he says, tell Brutus, tell that traitor,</l>
<l>That fool who was, that knave who ever will be;</l>
<l>That should I meet him in the field of battle,</l>
<l>Were his skull trebly thicker than it is,</l>
<l>I'd thoroughly examine its contents.</l>
<l>Is this denied me? When I bear the sway</l>
<l>With Titus, which perhaps he may remember</l>
<l>We earn'd together, I will send to Delphi,</l>
<l>On purpose, for that cudgel he presented</l>
<l>Unto the God; with which each day his shoulders</l>
<l>Shall be so flay'd, that he shall wish his feign'd</l>
<l>Were turn'd to real insensibility,</l>
<l>Treated with this correction during life.</l>
<l>Ask him too, if his bravery wars with women,</l>
<l>And whether he hath slain the aged queen?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRUTUS.</speaker>
<l>And dost thou bring no other message?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLAUDIUS.</speaker>
<l>None.</l>
</sp>

<pb n="140" facs="146"/>
<speaker>BRUTUS.</speaker>
<l>'Tis worthy of the sender, and the sent.</l>
<l>Go tell thy pleasant master, that I bear</l>
<l>Jointly with Collatine, chief sway in Rome:</l>
<l>Tell him the oracle is now fulfill'd;</l>
<l>Tell him I kiss'd my mother when I fell,</l>
<l>E'en in the very portico o'th' temple,</l>
<l>The earth, the general parent of us all.</l>
<l>And if 'twill farther please him, that the cudgel,</l>
<l>I to the god presented, was an emblem</l>
<l>Expressive of myself, a golden rod</l>
<l>Beneath a case of wood. As to his threats,</l>
<l>Tell him I heed them as the chiding gale,</l>
<l>Or th' ocean wave beating at the fix'd base</l>
<l>Of a high promontory. Though should I meet him</l>
<l>Mid the ensanguin'd field in glorious fight,</l>
<l>Engag'd for the great cause of liberty,</l>
<l>I'll dare the proudest of my country's foes,</l>
<l>And with the sword of vengeance, on his crest</l>
<l>Engrave a mark indelible: tell him</l>
<l>No Roman murders women: that we leave</l>
<l>To Tarquin and his sons; even the croud</l>
<l>Pursued her only through the streets with curses,</l>
<l>Invok'd the furies of her parents on her,</l>
<l>And saw her pass the city gate; so hence</l>
<l>In safety go, to him who sent thee hither.</l>
<stage>[<hi>Exit</hi> Claudius.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VALERIUS.</speaker>
<l>That missionary did but ill deserve</l>
<l>So civil a discharge.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BRUTUS.</speaker>
<l>Were Aruns us,</l>
<l>Neither would he have found it. Now, my friends,</l>
<l>To-morrow will Horatius and Herminius,</l>
<l>The Ardeates having to a truce agreed</l>
<l>For fifteen years, lead all the army homeward.</l>
<l><pb n="141" facs="147"/>
Then in the common meeting of the people,</l>
<l>Lest they should think two kings instead of one</l>
<l>(Though chosen annually) may lord it o'er them;</l>
<l>One of us, Collatine, will lay aside</l>
<l>Our symbols of command, only resumed</l>
<l>Alternate month by month. The good Papirius,</l>
<l>King of the holy things, shall offer up</l>
<l>Our general sacrifice, while we again,</l>
<l>And every individual then assembled,</l>
<l>Both for ourselves and our posterity,</l>
<l>Renew our solemn oath ne'er to admit</l>
<l>One of the Tarquin race. This night (more grateful</l>
<l>Than clouds-of inconse) let our secret prayers,</l>
<l>Our private gratitude, and thanks, ascend</l>
<l>To the high-ruling powers. For howsoe'er,</l>
<l>Vain man may think he plans with arduous care,</l>
<l>'Tis they alone his sentiments inspire,</l>
<l>They fill his breast with more than mortal fire,</l>
<l>'Tis they alone light up the patriot flame,</l>
<l>They lift the humble, and the haughty tame,</l>
<l>They every human accident foresee,</l>
<l>To them not accident, but certainty.</l>
