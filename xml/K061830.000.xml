<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>YE warbling songsters of the vocal grove,</l>
<l>Why waste you thus your soothing melody?</l>
<l>Sweet bubbling fountains, wherefore mix your voice</l>
<l>With the soft murmurs of the sighing breeze?</l>
<l>Were ye not given to charm the ear of peace,</l>
<l>The fair associate of liberty?—</l>
<l>These unpropitious regions claim you not!</l>
<l>Haste to Zanfara, and the happy shades</l>
<l>That crown her river's banks and crowd her shores;</l>
<l>From whence you long, too long, have been estrang'd,</l>
<l>With your Jaqueena; whom alas! such dark</l>
<l>And dire mischance involves, that hitherto</l>
<l>Her weak and wandering hope no period sees,</l>
<l>But in the arms of death!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA</speaker>
<stage>enters.</stage>
<l>—I seek my maid</l>
<l>With anxious steps, and still some solemn scene</l>
<l>Invites her melancholy stay, and owns</l>
<l>Her tears; shall not Amelia partake</l>
<l>Your woes, and with her love alleviate</l>
<l>The griefs that rend dear Laura's tender heart?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>If kind Amelia was not made so fair,</l>
<l>If she was not of Christian principles,</l>
<l>I might be led to trust her female heart</l>
<l>Possess'd compassion; but the frozen hue</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="5"/>That nature plants upon her outward form,</l>
<l>And what prescribes the maxims of her breast,</l>
<l>Make me at once to tremble and distrust:</l>
<l>And poor Jaqueena lives without a friend!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>My Laura's sweet benevolence of heart,</l>
<l>And the intelligence that forms her mind,</l>
<l>Should lift her far above such prejudice:</l>
<l>Or fair or dusk the hue that climate gives,</l>
<l>The blood that warms the veins with streams of life,</l>
<l>In both the same, with equal passion fires</l>
<l>The soul, with equal ardour in the sacred cause</l>
<l>Of honour beats, and forms the heart for love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>There is such soft delusion in your words,</l>
<l>(And what we wish we readiest believe)</l>
<l>I almost am persuaded in my mind,</l>
<l>Amelia holds a sister heart to mine.</l>
<l>But your stern deity still looks unmov'd</l>
<l>On massacre and blood, on slavery</l>
<l>And woe, avenging not—alas! I sink</l>
<l>Under the horror of his devotees.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>The time will come, my Laura, when you'll know</l>
<l>The wretches, who commit such dreadful crimes,</l>
<l>Are not of the religion you accuse.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>Were they not Christians that on Niger's flood,</l>
<l>On board their dreadful bark, receiv'd the lost</l>
<l>Jaqueena? (for the name of Laura bears</l>
<l>The badge of slavery, and my reproach.)</l>
<l>Are they, not Christians, who, in all this land,</l>
<l>Make the poor Africans perform the task</l>
<l>Of beasts; not barely to sustain the toil,</l>
<l>But to endure the torture; and with stripes,</l>
<l>With nakedness and hunger, to lie down,</l>
<l>Stall'd worse than beasts, to rankle in their sores?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>This is too much, sweet Laura; thus with tears,</l>
<l>See me lament my country's hapless crimes;</l>
<l><pb n="5" facs="6"/>And the vile prejudice which clogs the wheel</l>
<l>Of partial justice.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>—Can a slave then hope</l>
<l>For your humanity?—for tho' the blood</l>
<l>Is of one dye, without congenial suns</l>
<l>It ripens not, nor meliorates to love.</l>
<l>Yet will I not forget your bounteous gifts,</l>
<l>For Africans know not ingratitude!</l>
<l>I am a slave, not knowing bondage here,</l>
<l>But in detention from my native land;</l>
<l>For my kind mistress, as Amelia kind,</l>
<l>Nor gives me chains nor stripes, nor wears a frown.</l>
<l>There are some Christians of a milder soul,</l>
<l>And such poor Laura happily protect;</l>
<l>For if Amelia calls me by that name,</l>
<l>Its terrors cease, tho' it still comprehends</l>
<l>The tenor of my fortune.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>—Whilst your mind</l>
<l>Seems thus imprest with favourable thoughts,</l>
<l>And you confess Amelia's not severe,</l>
<l>Trust to my ear the story of your life,</l>
<l>And make me more your friend by sorrowing more,</l>
<l>By mingling mutual griefs with Laura's tears.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>A soothing melancholy still succeeds</l>
<l>The repetition of each solemn tale,</l>
<l>Misfortune has to tell.—In silence, grief</l>
<l>Preys most upon the soul; from sympathy,</l>
<l>From soft compassion of our sorrowings,</l>
<l>A sweet alleviation gently breathes.</l>
<l>Not of inferior race, my father rul'd</l>
<l>A province of the realm of Benin.—</l>
<l>Oft approbation shone upon his eye,</l>
<l>Oft fond affection fill'd my mother's looks,</l>
<l>Whilst on their smiling progeny they gaz'd,</l>
<l>And call'd, and kiss'd their daughter, now your slave.</l>

<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>Predicting, in the fondness of their hopes,</l>
<l>Propitious fortunes to their darling child.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>Nor were their hopes mere shadows of the mind;</l>
<l>For with affection's tenderest concern</l>
<l>My steps were follow'd, and my looks pursu'd;</l>
<l>They rul'd another's fate:—with breasts of ice,</l>
<l>As barren as the snows they emulate,</l>
<l>You fair ones call such truths mere vanity;</l>
<l>The great Manzaro kneel'd to win my heart:</l>
<l>What wretchedness is mine!—I lov'd the Prince,</l>
<l>Whom only death can to my love restore:</l>
<l>On his tremendous wing he'll bear me hence,</l>
<l>And to Zanfara waft this spirit safe,</l>
<l>Superior to the frauds of cruel men.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>Some better Iot, sweet Laura, may betide.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>Hope has departed hence, and left my soul</l>
<l>To follow after, when all earthly griefs</l>
<l>Are dissipated by the hand of death.</l>
<l>It soothes the sorrows of my wretched mind,</l>
<l>To grave the rock with piteous characters,</l>
<stage>(Points to the rock.)</stage>
<l>That move the fountain's never-ceasing tears,</l>
<l>To weep for ever o'er Manzara's name;</l>
<l>Whilst gentle spirits in the sighing winds,</l>
<l>On the sad sculptures mourn, that memorize</l>
<l>My mother and my brothers.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA</speaker>
<l>—What of them?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>Within the forest's skirts our tents were pitch'd,</l>
<l>For more commodious hunting; far advanc'd</l>
<l>The men were on the chase; when we, who held</l>
<l>The little camp, were taken prisoners:</l>
<l>A horrid tribe of robbers, then in league</l>
<l>With Europeans, trading to our states,</l>
<l>Had stolen upon our unsuspicious guards.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="8"/>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>Of what complexion, of what country born,</l>
<l>Were those base violators of the land?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>The cruel leaders were of British birth,</l>
<l>The rest of Africa; but long possess'd</l>
<l>By the fell demons of Europa's shores,</l>
<l>They, to recruit the heart for wickedness,</l>
<l>Imbibe infernal furies in their drink,</l>
<l>From deepest hell by chymic magic rais'd,</l>
<l>That drive the brain to madness, and impel</l>
<l>The hand to deeds of darkness.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>—What ensued?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>Our men were bound in fetters, neck to neck,</l>
<l>And hand to hand, and we their woeful steps</l>
<l>Must needs pursue:—when, frantic with her grief,</l>
<l>My mother seiz'd a javelin for revenge,</l>
<l>And by her angry arm one chieftain fell:</l>
<l>But anger and resistance were in vain!</l>
<l>She dy'd beneath a thousand dreadful wounds;</l>
<l>Whilst to her bleeding bosom, grasping close,</l>
<l>In agonies of death, her youngest son,</l>
<l>A cruel lance transfix'd both breasts at once;</l>
<l>And as the boy hung writhing on the shaft,</l>
<l>The wretches made diversion of his pangs.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>O Britain! where's thy boasted excellence?</l>
<l>Thy fame, that sounds on every peopled shore?</l>
<l>Thy vaunted jurisprudence, and thy love</l>
<l>Of liberty?—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>—I then conceiv'd no thought</l>
<l>Of what might follow, what should be our fate;</l>
<l>But in immediate sorrows my sad mind</l>
<l>Was all absorb'd.—We were receiv'd on board</l>
<l>A vessel, crowded with a wretched race:</l>
<l>Description finds no language to express</l>
<l>The horrors of the voyage.—The hand of fate</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="9"/>Releas'd a multitude!—within these arms</l>
<l>My other brother dy'd; and I'm forlorn!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>My soul is full of grief; and yet a ray</l>
<l>Of hope divine, like some prophetic light,</l>
<l>By influence of guardian angel given,</l>
<l>Takes hold upon my mind. —But we're observ'd;</l>
<l>You must avoid the person that draws near;</l>
<l>Retire, and spare your grief; the tale he brings</l>
<l>Would much increase your tears.—
<stage>Ex. Laura.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA</speaker>
<stage>alone.</stage>
<l>—I feel my heart</l>
<l>Renounce Antonio!—his hateful trade</l>
<l>Imbitters every thought of intercourse.</l>
<l>Habituated to subdue the force</l>
<l>Of his humanity, what can remain</l>
<l>Within the breast of man that offers fruits</l>
<l>For nuptial happiness?—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<stage>enters.</stage>
<l>—To meet you thus,</l>
<l>Is most propitious to my anxious hopes:</l>
<l>My voyage perform'd, with many healthy slaves</l>
<l>I now return, to claim your faithful vows;</l>
<l>And if the market proves of advanc'd price,</l>
<l>My fortune's made, and you alone command</l>
<l>My future life—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>—I know not what it means,</l>
<l>Some secret intimation moves my mind,</l>
<l>That no felicity can e'er attend</l>
<l>Riches obtain'd by such inhuman ways.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>Are these untoward sentiments conceiv'd</l>
<l>From Laura's guileful tears and whining tales?</l>
<l>Can my Amelia estrange her mind</l>
<l>From reason, and her proper judgment yield</l>
<l>To errors, which prevail alone through fraud?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>There's more than fraud, more than invention fills</l>
<l>The story of that hapless virgin's fate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="10"/>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>What inhumanity disturbs your thoughts?</l>
<l>The navigator is not culpable;</l>
<l>He takes the common traffic of the land,</l>
<l>And by his toil brings riches to the state;</l>
<l>The police of the nations there is such,</l>
<l>Like other animals, the herdsman sells</l>
<l>The Negro drove.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>—I tremble at the thought!</l>
<l>They that promote the sin, partake the crime.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>Inferior in creation, tho' in form</l>
<l>Of human kind;—each race of animals</l>
<l>Knows its gradations;—and from perfect man,</l>
<l>The Negro tribe is intermediate;</l>
<l>It links the series, that straight descend</l>
<l>Into the monkey line.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>—If you would save</l>
<l>My mind from detestation, treat not thus</l>
<l>A subject, over which my labouring soul</l>
<l>Endures acutest pangs; if you would win</l>
<l>My better sentiments, this traffic leave;</l>
<l>The generous association join,</l>
<l>Who labour in humanity's great cause,</l>
<l>With holy zeal, to gain abolishment</l>
<l>Of your infernal merchandize.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>My heart,</l>
<l>Already your's, your dictates must pursue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>'Tis well, Antonio, and my confidence</l>
<l>Renews: my Laura's sorrows fill my mind;</l>
<l>I must procure the maid her liberty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>And when obtain'd, what prospect will ensue?</l>
<l>Where are the means of giving happiness?</l>
<l>You'll only send her forth to meagre want,</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="11"/>And in a foreign land, a vagabond,</l>
<l>Expose her to a thousand miseries.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>She must return to Africa again,</l>
<l>Her country, and her friends.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—Romantic thought!</l>
<l>The wand'ring tribe she left, perhaps dispers'd,</l>
<l>The government dissolv'd, new tyrants reign;</l>
<l>And warfare, the rough habit of their lives,</l>
<l>With chequer'd fortunes marks each petty Prince,</l>
<l>Now reigning, now in chains,—on Afric's coast,</l>
<l>To greater perils, greater woes expos'd;</l>
<l>There's not a slave that in this province toils,</l>
<l>But, if return'd, would worship the dire name</l>
<l>Of slavery, that makes them tremble now.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>Your arguments enlarge the dreadful bounds</l>
<l>Of that vast sin which on your traffic rests;</l>
<l>If restitution is impossible,</l>
<l>The base captivity, (that thus cuts off</l>
<l>All human hope, and no kind limit yields</l>
<l>To the sad injury, but in the tomb,)</l>
<l>Of all the crimes on earth, becomes the worst:</l>
<l>My weary mind now finds no resting-place,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>Even the servitude in which they sigh,</l>
<l>Affords superior happiness and ease</l>
<l>To what their birthright gave—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>—Desist, desist,</l>
<l>I'll hear no more.—'Tis in the human mind</l>
<l>The various estimates of happiness</l>
<l>Are rang'd, whilst free and voluntary will</l>
<l>Directs the choice.—It is not luxury,</l>
<l>With all its artificial wants and woes,</l>
<l>That points out the criterion to mankind:</l>
<l>It is not circumstance, prescrib'd and bound</l>
<l>Within the limits of necessity,</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="12"/>(For that's a term mere fashion has assum'd)</l>
<l>That points where Happiness shall stay her foot:</l>
<l>'Tis habit that prepares the mind for ease;</l>
<l>And knowing no restraint, contentment gives</l>
<l>The various types that various nations hold,</l>
<l>Whence to characterise the heavenly gift,</l>
<l>Each calls felicity.—The human soul</l>
<l>Finds liberty so innate, through the world</l>
<l>The love of it prevails.—See, Pembroke comes,</l>
<l>Humanity's fast friend.—</l>
</sp>

<l>Own son.—</l>

<l>America stands blighted in her fame!</l>
<l>How are the annals of her glory stain'd!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>What new occasion wounds your gracious mind?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>Still here we hold the mart of human kind,</l>
<l>New cargoes crowd our shores, and on the beach</l>
<l>The squalid multitudes are pouring forth,</l>
<l>From over-loaded ships, which, like the curse</l>
<l>Of vile Pandora's box, bring forth disease,</l>
<l>With misery, and pallid want,</l>
<l>Crippled and maim'd, whose ulcerating sores</l>
<l>Cling to the canker'd chains, that rankle deep,</l>
<l>And seek the bone.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—Exists there not a law</l>
<l>Which should restrain such mischief-working tongues,</l>
<l>As hurt the merchant's credit and his wares?</l>
<l>Thy phrase is false; the slaves are healthy, young,</l>
<l>And vigorous.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>—Then be it so.—The world,</l>
<l>With anxious eye, regarded ev'ry step</l>
<l>That led the revolution to effect,</l>

<l>Beheld our strength:—Our public virtue shone</l>
<l>With a meridian lustre, that amaz'd</l>
<l>The nations who submit to monarchy,</l>
<l>And heaven stood influenc'd, propitious stood,</l>
<l>And look'd approving on the energy</l>
<l>That in the sacred cause of liberty,</l>
<l>In ev'ry prayer we breath'd, in every step</l>
<l>Maintain'd, that brought fruition to our hopes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>How has our country forfeited its fame?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>In Britain, which we did calumniate</l>
<l>With charge of tyranny and power usurp'd,</l>
<l>The flame, humanity's most holy flame,</l>
<l>Breaks forth illustrious; all the people burn</l>
<l>With sense of liberty: they boasted not!</l>
<l>And the poor African the object grows</l>
<l>Of their wise councils, and their sov'reign's care:</l>
<l>Whilst we, who mocked God with impious prayer,</l>
<l>Mock'd the surrounding world with fallacy,</l>
<l>Assum'd a character we could not prove;</l>
<l>Now sever'd—now alien'd—and left alone,</l>
<l>Pull off the mask, and vote an impious law,</l>

<l>And treachery few momentary smiles</l>
<l>Of fortune fall; but probity affords</l>
<l>Stability and honour to a state.</l>

<l>—The legislature wisely saw</l>
<l>Inevitable ruin must succeed,</l>
<l>If instantly we should emancipate</l>
<l>And trust to hirelings.—Such excessive change</l>
<l>In dire confusion would involve the land;</l>
<l>What mode of government could e'er restrain</l>
<l>The slaves discharg'd and set at liberty?</l>
<l>That mighty work must by progression move,</l>
<l>And into habit grow by slow degrees;</l>
<l>Experience of clemency and laws,</l>

<l>Are you deceiv'd, Amelia, by such phrase?</l>

<speaker>CALABAN.</speaker>
<l>THIS was a glorious voyage!—The sturdy knaves</l>
<l>Are fit for any labour, and we bring</l>
<l>Full fifteen hundred safely to the port.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HORATIO.</speaker>
<l>What province are they of?—For much depends</l>
<l>Upon the breed; some of the upland slaves,</l>
<l>That border on the desert, are of mind</l>
<l>So dark and so indocile, that they seem</l>
<l>Of one gradation only above brutes;</l>
<l>Those of more eastern clime are indolent,</l>
<l>(As bears are sluggish, and not mov'd by stripes,)</l>
<l>They'll neither serve the mill nor till the ground.</l>

<speaker>CALABAN.</speaker>
<l>Well, master, mine are of the fav'rite breed;</l>
<l>Twice ten degrees remov'd from the baboon;</l>
<l>Their form is human, and they're almost men:</l>
<l>Boney and strong, of countenance acute,</l>
<l>And as hyaenas savage:—they're the slaves</l>
<l>For labour; as the mind is fierce and quick,</l>
<l>Their bodies in proportion active are;</l>
<l><pb n="15" facs="16"/>On mountains skirts and wilds of Zara bred,</l>
<l>The topsmen drove the herd to Niger's banks,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>HORATIO.</speaker>
<l>—Five hundred males</l>
<l>I purchase at your price; but in the lot</l>
<l>I'll not receive that brute, that stands aloof,</l>
<l>And looks as if he held high estimate</l>
<l>Of his own consequence; a slave like him</l>

<l>Was this the land where that celestialdrug,</l>
<l>That cures a thousand evils of the mind,</l>
<l>Was planted by the seraphs of the sun,</l>
<l>And by fair daughters of the silent moon</l>
<l>Water'd with dew of heaven, here I might find</l>
<l>The godlike gift of liberty; perhaps</l>
<l>In its vicinity doth justice grow;</l>
<l>Of these I'd mix a potion should disgorge</l>
<l>The monsters of the deep.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—To merit such</l>

<l>Compassionate my fortune, not contemn</l>
<l>My impotence!—behold these shameful chains;</l>
<l>Are they not peaceable! are not these hands</l>
<l>Submissive?—and this neck obedient?</l>

<l>If an exertion could improve my lot?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>Thy moderation merits our esteem;</l>
<l>If ought of justice thou hast here to claim,</l>

<l>Within the public hall, dispensing there</l>
<l>Impartially.—</l>
</sp>

<speaker>MOOR.</speaker>
<l>—I mark thee wond'rous well;</l>
<l>And if the spirits of my ancestors</l>

<l>O'er the wide desert of the dreary main,</l>
<l>Perhaps the deity which we adore</l>

<l>He knows not what he says.—</l>
</sp>

<l>As stubble to the lightning, I could shake</l>
<l>These links to atoms, that my vengeful eyes</l>
<l>Might see thy heart's blood spout; but that my views</l>
<l>Are larger, and this friend to human kind</l>
<l>Has breath'd into my soul a nobler hope,</l>
<l>And made me dream of justice.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALABAN.</speaker>
<l>—And thy dream</l>
<l>Will, like the vision of the rolling cloud,</l>
<l>Dissolve, and only mock thy sickly brain:</l>
<l>Return,—and at the lodge where thou art stall'd</l>
<l>Wait for to-morrow's market.—</l>

<l>Would sometimes heave his breast, or tears would fall.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>MOOR.</speaker>
<l>I crave to stand before the governor,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALABAN.</speaker>
<l>There is no law that can discharge a slave:</l>

<speaker>MOOR.</speaker>
<l>I Mark'd his countenance, and tho' there seem'd</l>
<l>A want of openness, simplicity,</l>
<l>The character of truth, stood in his looks:</l>
<l>His words were few, but pertinent and strong;</l>

<l>You entertain some doubts.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—Hypocrisy</l>
<l>Can mask the guileful measures of the heart</l>
<l>With fairest guise:—when he assumes too much,</l>
<l>He gives distrust:—no outward show's requir'd</l>
<l>By virtue.—Tho' the homely dress denies</l>
<l>The power of riches, avarice prevails,</l>
<l>Lucre of gold, and traffic is his God.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOOR.</speaker>
<l>Ha!—</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—Next of kin to griping avarice</l>
<l>Is fraud.—</l>

<speaker>MOOR.</speaker>
<l>Am I betray'd?—Has he deceiv'd?</l>

<l>Be not alarm'd; perhaps I doubt too much.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOOR.</speaker>
<l>Attend,—are we perceiv'd?—can no one hear?</l>
<l>All's safe.—In infancy my father plac'd</l>
<l>His first-born son with a most holy seer,</l>
<l>The high-priest of the Gods, to educate</l>
<l>In all the sacred learning of the sage;</l>
<l><pb n="27" facs="28"/>Who, having gift of prophecy, would oft</l>
<l>Gaze on my face with tears, and cast his signs,</l>
<l>To try if some good star might still prevail</l>
<l>Against predestin'd evils, which he saw</l>
<l>Wrote in the book of fate; from study deep</l>
<l>And science most divine, discovering</l>
<l>A favourable planet, he divulg'd</l>
<l>His thoughts.—</l>

<l>"(Nor distant far the years) captivity</l>
<l>"Shall be thy wretched fate.—A charm I hold</l>

<l>Fast to the sacred altar, and my eyes</l>
<l>With mystic fillet clos'd; then on my thigh</l>
<l>Incision made, and introduc'd the charm,</l>

<l>As was foretold might yet averted be</l>
<l>By pious works, or aid of powers above,</l>
<l>That to the grave the holy boon I'd bear,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—A prescience</l>
<l>Astonishing!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOOR.</speaker>
<l>—The dire event was come,</l>
<l>And now the time and due occasion call'd</l>
<l><pb n="28" facs="29"/>For this important gift to make its way</l>
<l>To light, and give me liberty.—I told</l>
<l>The secret to my friend, to Pembroke told</l>
<l>What gift I held; and tho' he would deny</l>
<l>What superstition seem'd, he lent his hand,</l>
<l>And with a lancet brought a jewel forth</l>
<l>That would have ransom'd all the slaves you hold.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>'Tis well I know the secret of this trust;</l>
<l>Perhaps he may prove faithful; but if not,</l>
<l>I am thy witness to confront his fraud:</l>
<l>So great a trust, for avarice to tempt,</l>
<l>Will prove his virtue to its very source.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOOR.</speaker>
<l>You see what inadvertency pursu'd</l>
<l>The strange event;—for had I known what charm</l>
<l>The holy priest bestow'd, more privacy</l>
<l>Would have prevail'd:—but full of pious faith,</l>
<l>I thought I merely held some mystic gift</l>
<l>To influence the powers invisible.</l>

<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>To what intent was Pembroke then to hold</l>
<l>The gem?—</l>

<l>SUCH is the subtlety of this man's mind,</l>
<l>That to disarm me of my chief pretext,</l>
<l>As he conceives, on an appeal to justice,</l>
<l>He has restor'd me these habiliments;</l>

<l>The former year, by some rapacious bands,</l>

<l>Which Europeans hold) the scatter'd tents</l>
<l>Of princes hunting, and by females held,</l>
<l>Were sack'd and pillag'd, and the families</l>
<l>Were driven to the shores, and sold for slaves.</l>
<l>Of them a maid, whom love had made my own,</l>
<l>And sacred rites had form'd our union:</l>
<l>This sad catastrophe I much had mourn'd,</l>
<l>And, tho' despair possess'd my aching heart,</l>
<l>In th' ensuing season I came down</l>
<l>To Niger's banks, and pass'd the friendly states</l>
<l>With slender equipage, not fearing ill;</l>

<l>—It was my fate</l>
<l>To meet a foe like aligator bred,</l>

<l>My anxious tale with tears,—and might have wept</l>
<l>Unto some statue cut of Parian stone</l>

<l>Was of Cassaena, and my station there</l>
<l>Superior:—to talk of dignities</l>
<l>Would ill befit my fortune thus revers'd.</l>
<l>Look on the clasp that girds my turban's front,</l>

<l>My liberty; my goods esteem'd as trash</l>

<l>His name is gone abroad; some slaves were brought</l>
<l>From his dominions, and he oft was seen</l>
<l>In secret converse, pleading earnestly</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—To receive</l>
<l>Such vague report and information void</l>
<l>Of proof will not induce the legislative power</l>
<l>To interfere.—There is a dignity</l>

<l>Such perspicuity in all his phrase,</l>

<l>We are not left to doubt his high estate;</l>
<l>From a full sense of those base injuries</l>

<l>But whilst humanity promotes one cause,</l>
<l>Another it preserves,—my country's weal:</l>

<l>And promises of Afric's wealth, he own'd</l>
<l>Revenge rag'd in his heart; a wish to gain</l>
<l>Retaliation for his country's woes,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>

<l>He told me, in an agony of mind,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>He read!—</l>

<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>My passions are on fire.—

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>—And when his mind</l>
<l>Was all absorb'd, forgetting I was there,</l>
<l>He kneel'd, and in an extacy grief,</l>
<l>Thrice call'd aloud, in his own dialect,</l>
<l>Jaqueena!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—Ha!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PEMBROKE.</speaker>
<l>—As if he would invoke</l>
<l>Some demon, and the fiends of Africa.</l>
</sp>

<l>The firstlings of my flock!—

<stage>(Exit Pembroke.)</stage></l>
<l>This is a foe I never once had fear'd;</l>
<l>Jaqueena is the maid whom he laments,</l>
<l>For whom he lost his liberty:—To him,</l>
<l>Or to a legion of the Negro tribe,</l>
<l>I'll not resign her:—for my heart is her's;</l>
<l>Nor Spanish pride, nor Afric's haughty sons,</l>
<l>Shall from my anxious bosom wrest the maid.</l>

<l>My lord, the plot is laid; and to the hands</l>
<l>Of Calaban, poor Laura's doom'd to pass:</l>
<l>Some island of the Indies is agreed</l>
<l>To be her place of bondage:—I have learnt</l>
<l>The hour of their departure.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—Then take care</l>
<l>To have the necessary means prepar'd,</l>
<l>Not only of her safety, but to bear</l>
<l>Her to my distant villa with all speed,</l>
<l>There wait my coming.—</l>

<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—My confidence</l>
<l>Is plac'd in thee.—

<l>—The Moor shall lose his hopes,</l>

<l>Serves not to gratify my will in this,</l>

<l>The labours that attend on government.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>YOU are deceiv'd and trifled with,—the prince</l>
<l>Has a sublimity of mind, superior</l>
<l>To stratagems like these.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—It was a charge</l>
<l>So grounded, and the facts established</l>
<l>By proofs so strong, I could not hesitate</l>
<l>To send him into durance, till we heard</l>
<l>The slaves were peaceful, and the tumult hush'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>There was no tumult.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—All Martino's slaves</l>
<l>Had mutinied.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—There never was more peace</l>
<l>Than at the instant;—not a voice was heard</l>
<l>Through the plantation.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—And Horatio's men</l>
<l>Caball'd, refus'd to labour, and had sung</l>
<l>The war-song.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—All a fiction,—all is false;</l>
<l>A tale just calculated to reduce the price</l>
<l>Of my imported cargo, by advice</l>
<l>Of Pembroke, to affect the planters minds</l>
<l>With terror, and prevent their bargaining</l>
<l>In times of pressing danger.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—Both gave proof</l>
<l>In charge against Manzara.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="52" facs="53"/>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—I repeat</l>
<l>You were abus'd; they knew not why he brought</l>
<l>Them hither, but propos'd such tale to them,</l>
<l>For the base purpose, I declare, they knew</l>
<l>No tittle of the charge against the prince:</l>
<l>Read there,—they certify the fact.—
<stage>(gives a paper.)</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—Good Heav'n</l>
<l>Protect us from such wiles!—what could induce</l>
<l>The villain to these practices?—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—A hope</l>
<l>Of robbing the afflicted prisoner,</l>
<l>Avoiding justice, and escaping hence,</l>
<l>With such a booty as his avarice</l>
<l>Could not resist:—Integrity</l>
<l>Is a mere outside semblance he assumes,</l>
<l>To mask a soul replete with darkest fraud.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>I know not what's alluded to.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—A fact,</l>
<l>Will strike you with abhorrence;—having plac'd</l>
<l>Much confidence in this perfidious wretch,</l>
<l>He to his care entrusted a rich gem,</l>
<l>By which he might his ransom and return</l>
<l>Obtain;—in order, with impunity,</l>
<l>To rob the captive stranger he procur'd</l>
<l>First, his imprisonment by a false charge,</l>
<l>Then got on board a ship prepar'd to sail</l>
<l>For Spain.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—My soul is griev'd,—I've been deceiv'd,</l>
<l>And to sad inadvertencies betray'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>Which soon may be retriev'd.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—There is my doubt.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="53" facs="54"/>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>The prince may be restor'd to liberty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>My heart is now with much compunction smote.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>What moves you thus?—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—Proceed—did he escape?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>Hearing of these transactions, and inform'd</l>
<l>Of the great trust, I got an officer</l>
<l>To go on board and seize the treacherous knave,</l>
<l>Just as the sails were bent, and tide had serv'd</l>
<l>To carry him to sea.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—With equal speed</l>
<l>Send to the prison, and release the Moor.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>Your Zangae comes this way.—
<stage>(Zangae enters.)</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—'Tis opportune,</l>
<l>Haste and release the Moor, —if yet he lives.
<stage>(Exit Zangae.)</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>Is there a doubt?—You wound my tortur'd soul!—</l>
<l>Is there a fear?—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—But of the precious gem?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>For the poor prince I'm all anxiety.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>What the event?—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—The man, suspecting not</l>
<l>That I was privy to the trust, retain'd</l>
<l>The stone, nor try'd to hide his purpos'd fraud</l>
<l>By throwing it in the sea; on search,</l>
<l>We found it in his bosom:—evidence</l>
<l>Sufficient to the magistrate appear'd</l>
<l>To cast him into prison;—see the price</l>
<l><pb n="54" facs="55"/>Of his iniquity.
<stage>(produces the jewel)</stage>
My heart's distress'd,</l>
<l>I tremble for the Moor!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—To this dread charge</l>
<l>The villain wrought upon my guilty mind,</l>
<l>With such insinuations of the love</l>
<l>Manzara entertain'd or had avow'd</l>
<l>For Laura, and his purpose to withdraw</l>
<l>The maid from hence;—that—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—The fair interest</l>
<l>Which Laura claims in her Manzara's breast,</l>
<l>Might warrant all that Pembroke could devise;</l>
<l>But she is ignorant,—so is the Moor,</l>
<l>That they're so near a wish'd for intercourse.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>My conscience is disturb'd;—I own my crimes,</l>
<l>And wish that retribution could be had:</l>
<l>The guilty passions were inflam'd with love,</l>
<l>Unlawful as it was;—my jealousy</l>
<l>Was basely rous'd,—and vengence fill'd my mind:</l>
<l>Under pretext of service to the state,</l>
<l>By my removing an obnoxious Moor,</l>
<l>Who would an insurrection have stir'd up</l>
<l>Among the slaves,—I sent my mandate forth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>What was its tenor?—for I dread the blow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>That in the prison they should strangle him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>Oh horrid cruelty!—Oh innocence</l>
<l>That suffers mighty woes!—A captive here,</l>
<l>Drag'd from his country, and a diadem!</l>
<l>By Calaban ensnar'd,—and now betray'd</l>
<l>To death!—What dreadful crimes we perpetrate!</l>
<l>And yet the vengeance of offended Heaven</l>
<l>Is long with-held?—</l>

<l>The blood of innocence is fall'n.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l><stage>(Looking out.)</stage>
—Rejoice,</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> MANZARA <hi>and</hi> ZANGAE.</stage>
<stage>JEROME <hi>to</hi> ZANGAE.</stage>
<l>Haste to your charge;—and mark me, only watch</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ZANGAE.</speaker>
<l>The people I have station'd.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>—Get thee hence.
<stage>(Exit Zangae.)</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANZARA.</speaker>
<l>So long inur'd to injury and chains,</l>
<l>Methinks, the powers of Heaven have so decreed</l>
<l>They are my lot for life!—What further woes</l>
<l>Would you inflict?—behold your victim stands</l>
<l>To hear the judgment you'll again pronounce.</l>
<l>I have no more than life itself to lose!</l>
<l>By men of your complexion, whose cold souls</l>
<l>Are frozen up in ice, I lost my realm,</l>
<l>My wife, my country, and my liberty!</l>
<l>Now to accomplish all, spare not the poor</l>
<l>Vile remnant of possession, spare it not!</l>
<l>But send this soul to join my ancestors,</l>
<l>Who hover for me on the mountain's top!</l>
<l>Where is the executioner?—be quick,</l>
<l>For I am weary, and would be at rest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>Not to increase thy injuries or woes,</l>
<l>But to redress them, art thou brought.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANZARA.</speaker>
<l>—I heard</l>
<l>A voice say, "thou hast liberty," and straight</l>
<l>The shackles of a slave were taken off:</l>
<l><pb n="56" facs="57"/>No sooner I possess'd the sacred bliss,</l>
<l>Than I endur'd the manacles prepar'd</l>
<l>For criminals: —so momentary prove</l>
<l>The smiles of fortune in Manzara's fate!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>With my own hands I take these fetters off;</l>
<l>And in my arms, with cordial embrace,</l>
<l>Insure thee of protection.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>—It's with grief</l>
<l>The governor perceives how multiply'd</l>
<l>Were your misfortunes, and his gracious heart</l>
<l>Is warm'd to do you service.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>Confident</l>
<l>I need not doubt thy faith, this scymeter's</l>
<l>Restor'd; an ornament, for no rude cause</l>
<l>Will urge thee to its use.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANZARA.</speaker>
<l>I bless the gods</l>
<l>This happy change takes place! perhaps once more</l>
<l>Cassaena's distant land I may behold!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO.</speaker>
<l>To heighten this new prospect of your peace,</l>
<l>Behold the gem regain'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANZARA.</speaker>
<l>I fear the change</l>
<l>(So rapid a transition) is not built</l>
<l>On stable ground-work!—If my gracious lord</l>
<l>Will lend assistance for our hiring hence</l>
<l>A vessel to Great Britain's wealthy isle,</l>
<l>Where an illustrious king, as the broad sun,</l>
<l>Shines forth amidst the council of the stars</l>
<l>To animate the world, dispenses round</l>
<l>The influence of wisdom; thence we'll learn</l>
<l>Sage maxims for our government, and safe</l>
<l>Pass to Cassaena's lov'd and mourning land:</l>
<l>You'll thence repay me richly for the woes</l>
<l>I have sustain'd within your territories.</l>

<l>And Heaven, that heard our vows, protects our love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>My heart grows sick—my eye's obscur'd by mists,</l>
<l>And darkness and confusion cloud my mind.</l>
<l>Oh my Amelia!—Fate has cruel been,</l>
<l>And unrelenting!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANZARA.</speaker>
<l>—What of grief remains?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>Your tears distress me deeply!—wherefore weep?</l>
<l>Manzara lives, and you have liberty!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>Draw near, beloved prince,—and let me pour</l>
<l>My woes into thy soul!—Oh! hear the tale</l>
<l>That disappoints my joys,—and pity me!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANZARA.</speaker>
<l>Most holy Heavens! what sorrows yet exist</l>
<l>To aggrandize the griefs I have endur'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>Well knowing that Teresa's jealousy</l>
<l>Would soon expose me to some cruel change,</l>
<l>And melancholy having seiz'd my mind,</l>
<l>For long I thought Manzara lost to me,</l>
<l>I straight determin'd to avoid the fate</l>
<l>Of falling into Calaban's rude hands,</l>
<l>Nor yet submit to the impiety</l>
<l>Which mov'd the Governor:—the wretched world</l>
<l>Had lost all joys, and hope her sportive wing,</l>
<l>That us'd the youthful fancy oft to charm</l>
<l>With visions soft as sweet.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>—Why cease you there,</l>
<l>And leave us in this anxious suspense?</l>
</sp>

<l>The tardy floods of life forget to flow;</l>
<l>I faint.—</l>

<l>And with refreshing breath of Heav'n renew</l>
<l>Her strength.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>—Manzara! oh much lov'd lord!</l>
<l>From whose dear image fancy never stray'd;</l>
<l>Imprest upon this heart thy character,</l>
<l>Which love conceiv'd, nor day nor night remov'd:</l>
<l>Thou wert the vision of my happiest dream,</l>
<l>And in the gloom of the detested cell,</l>
<l>As o'er the vast Atlantic we were borne,</l>
<l>And when America her slave receiv'd,</l>
<l>Thou held my thoughts, and all my wishes fill'd!</l>
<l>But hope was fled, and black despair was come;</l>
<l>Whilst death alone held out a saving hand:</l>
<l>Rash was the deed, and hapless it has prov'd,</l>
<l>(The gods condemn my want of confidence)</l>
<l>The poison, which my bracelet long conceal'd,</l>
<l>Was—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>—Horrible, and heart distracting tale!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MANZARA.</speaker>
<l>Then all my wish'd for happiness is fled,</l>
<l>And launch'd again upon the stormy sea</l>
<l>Of wretchedness, new fortunes I must try;</l>
<l>Pleasures sweet prospects Africa has lost!</l>
<l>Manzara is undone!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
<l>Haste for assistance, Zangae,—med'cine</l>
<l>May yet relieve—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>—Impossible!</l>
<l>The bane is of such subtle quality,</l>
<l>Compounded by Zanfara's wisest dames,</l>
<l>It scorns repelling powers!—the hand of death</l>
<l><pb n="63" facs="64"/>Lies heavy on my heart;—and every nerve</l>
<l>Aches with convulsion.—</l>

<l>—Oh misery extreme!</l>
<l>All the monition's lost, which thy fair hand</l>
<l>Inscrib'd upon the rocks, that might have led</l>
<l>To thy discovery and sav'd despair!</l>
<l>There Pembroke too deceiv'd!—and I, employ'd</l>
<l>Too much on selfish views, neglected those</l>
<l>That should have sav'd us both!—but 'tis too late!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
<l>Whilst there is life, indulge me with thy gaze,</l>

<l>Like some blest saint who confident in God</l>
<l>Refuses earth one groan!—</l>

<l>Sustaining such extremity of woe?</l>

<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<l>If ever more authority I shew,</l>

<l>Compassion for my woes, embalm the corpse,</l>

<l>The scene of so much terror and distress!</l>
<l>Zangae shall be the partner of my tears:</l>

<l>Perhaps relenting fates will yet retain</l>
<l>Some pity for the Moor,—that he may land</l>
<l>On native shores,—and there erect on high</l>
<l>A monument, that shall command the hearts</l>
