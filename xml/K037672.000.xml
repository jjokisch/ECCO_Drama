<p>TO THOMAS BARRETT, <abbr>Esq</abbr> THE FOLLOWING TRAGEDY IS INSCRIBED, BY HIS OBLIGED, AND VERY AFFECTIONATE, HUMBLE SERVANT, The AUTHOR.</p>

<div1 type="notice">
<pb facs="3"/>
<head>Advertisement.</head>
<p>IT may perhaps be necessary to acquaint the reader, that the author has ventured to make Polydore a person of the Drama, on the authority of Hyginus, a Greek grammarian, who tells us in one of his fables, that Ilione, by a feigned murder, deceived Polymestor, and preserved her brother's life.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="prologue">
<pb facs="4"/>
<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by Mr. LLOYD.</byline>
<stage>And spoken by Mr. GARRICK.</stage>
<lg>
<l>A Grecian bard, two thousand years ago,</l>
<l>Plan'd this sad fable, of illustrious woe;</l>
<l>Waken'd each soft emotion of the breast,</l>
<l>And call'd forth tears, that would not be supprest.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet, O ye mighty sirs, of judgement chaste,</l>
<l>Who, lacking genius, have a deal of taste,</l>
<l>Can you forgive our modern ancient piece,</l>
<l>Which brings no chorus, tho' it comes from Greece;</l>
<l>Kind social chorus, which all humours meets,</l>
<l>And sings and dances, up and down the streets.</l>
<l>— Oh! might true taste in these unclassic days,</l>
<l>Revive the Grecian fashions, with their plays!</l>
<l>Then rais'd on stilts, our player's would stalk and rage,</l>
<l>And at three steps, stride o'er a modern stage;</l>
<l>Each gesture then would boast unusual charms,</l>
<l>From lengthen'd legs, stuff'd body, sprawling arms!</l>
<l>Your critic eye would then no pigmies see,</l>
<l>But buskin's make a giant, ev'n of <hi>Me.</hi></l>
<l>No features then the poet's mind would trace,</l>
<l>But one blank vizor blot out all the face.</l>
<l>O! glorious times, when actors thus could strike</l>
<l>Expressive, inexpressive, all alike!</l>
<l>Less change of face, than in our Punch they saw,</l>
<l>For Punch can roll his eyes, and wag his jaw;</l>
<l>With one set glare they mouth'd the rumbling verse,</l>
<l>Our <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> look not half so fierce!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="5"/>
<l>Yet tho' depriv'd of instruments like these,</l>
<l>Nature, perhaps, may find a way to please;</l>
<l>Which, wheresoe'er she glows with genuine flame,</l>
<l>In <hi>Greece,</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> is the same.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Of raillery then, ye modern wits beware,</l>
<l>Nor damn the Grecian poet, for the player.</l>
<l>Theirs was the skill, with honest help of art,</l>
<l>To win by just degrees, the yielding heart.</l>
<l>What if our Shakespear claims the magic throne,</l>
<l>And in one instant makes us all his own,</l>
<l>They differ only, in the point of view,</l>
<l>For Shakespear's nature, was their nature too.</l>

<stage>ULYSSES, TALTHYBIUS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>WHAT—when the peace, the future fame of Greece,</l>
<l>Hang on th' event, does Nestor thus advise?</l>
<l>Thou must mistake him, herald.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TALTHYBIUS.</speaker>
<l>With due deference</l>
<l>He hears Ulysses' counsel; yet compassion</l>
<l>Prompts him to listen to Pyrechmes' suit,</l>
<l>And yield up Hecuba.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Compassion!—weakness!</l>
<l>Meer womanish weakness! call it nothing better,</l>
<l>I feel a crimson blush burn on my cheek</l>
<l>E'vn at the thought. Was it for this, dread I</l>
<l>We led our Argives to Scamander's banks</l>
<l>To toil ten tedious years? was it for this,</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="7"/>You crown'd those toils with conquest? oh for pity,</l>
<l>Send thy sage spirit to direct our councils,</l>
<l>That veer as passion drives. See where our sails</l>
<l>Stand bent at Chersonesus, to transport</l>
<l>Us and our spoils to Greece: and shall we leave</l>
<l>The noblest, most important part behind,</l>
<l>The queen of Troy and her young dangerous daughter,</l>
<l>Because Pyrechmes bids? What is Pyrechmes,</l>
<l>That Greece in her full glory fears his frown?</l>
<l>Greece has more cause to fear a future foe.</l>
<l>Yes, from releas'd Polyxena may spring</l>
<l>New Hectors, arm'd to wreak revenge hereafter,</l>
<l>And send our sons to people Pluto's realms.</l>
<l>By force, I must detain her, or by fraud:</l>
<l>For my own sake I must: for on Ulysses</l>
<l>The shame, the weakness, want of policy,</l>
<l>All fall upon Ulysses.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TALTHYBIUS.</speaker>
<l>Yet the queen's</l>
<l>Distressful state—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Talthybius, do not think,</l>
<l>That ten long years of bloodshed stop up here</l>
<l>The passages to pity. No, the groans</l>
<l>Of reverend, wretched age, the tears that gush</l>
<l>From the sad eyes of supplicating beauty,</l>
<l>Wou'd melt my heart too at less dangerous times:</l>
<l>But now — back herald to the king; inform him —</l>
<l>Yet stay. — Have these ambassadors with Nestor</l>
<l>Held private conference?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="8"/>
<speaker>TALTHYBIUS.</speaker>
<l>Young Eriphilus</l>
<l>Enter'd his tent at day-break. Till which time,</l>
<l>With Iphitus alone has he confer'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>That lowring leader of a Trojan troop,</l>
<l>Just ripe for a revolt?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TALTHYBIUS.</speaker>
<l>He, royal sir,</l>
<l>The queen's chief oracle — as for Melanthus —</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Aye, what of him? what know'st thou of Melanthus?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TALTHYBIUS.</speaker>
<l>Nothing. He shuns all converse, and seems rapt</l>
<l>In melancholy musings.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Yes, th' old man</l>
<l>Seems close and crafty; bears himself a loof;</l>
<l>Keeps his young charge, as 'twere, beneath his wing.</l>
<l>I do not like that caution: it means mischief.</l>
<l>Else wherefore ventur'd not the youth alone?</l>
<l>What needed this grey-bearded monitor</l>
<l>To help him pay the ransom? — Say to Nestor,</l>
<l>I'll meet him at his tent.</l>
<stage>Exit Tal.</stage>
<l>My doubts were just!</l>
<l>Danger doth lurk beneath the hoary locks</l>
<l>Of this Melanthus. There's some secret plot —</l>
<l>'Tis scarce engender'd yet; and prudence bids</l>
<l>We crush the dang'rous birth. Yes, if the wizard</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="9"/>I've conjur'd up, wave skilfully his wand,</l>
<l>The princess shall be fetter'd with a charm</l>
<l>Faster than his fond efforts can undo.</l>
<l>And for the queen — why, let the queen go free.</l>
<l>It harms not us: her barren womb no more</l>
<l>Shall teem with Trojan pests: and such an act</l>
<l>May smooth the roughness of our enterprize,</l>
<l>And calm Pyrechmes. True, we fear him not;</l>
<l>Yet policy forbids us to despise</l>
<l>Ev'n a weak foe, till we recruit our pow'rs,</l>
<l>Thin'd by a ten years siege.</l>
</sp>

<l>At great Achilles' tomb, Calchas, dread sir,</l>
<l>Awaits your royal will.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>I follow thee. —</l>
<l>Aye, now I will inspire that holy seer</l>
<l>With counsel, that from his prophetic mouth</l>
<l>Shall seem heav'n's voice. — But first let me assail</l>
<l>This boy — ambassador. And therefore come I</l>
<l>To the queen's tent. Open he seems and free:</l>
<l>And from his shallow mind my art may draw</l>
<l>The dangerous schemes of his grave monitor,</l>
<l>And do the chiefs rich service. — He approaches.</l>
<l>But with him the old man. I will withdraw</l>
<l>Till a fit time, and muse on some device</l>
<l>To lure this youngling from his tutor's beck.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<stage><pb n="5" facs="10"/>ERIPHILUS, MELANTHUS, AETHRON.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>AETHRON.</speaker>
<l>Here doth my guidance end. Behold the place</l>
<l>Where all the live-long day the royal captives</l>
<l>Pour forth their piteous plaints. That little tent,</l>
<l>Spread in the darksom gloom of yon lone beech,</l>
<l>Contains all Troy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>Thanks for thy conduct, soldier.</l>
<l>Yet sure it needed not. This far-off station,</l>
<l>These interrupted bursts of female sorrow,</l>
<l>Proclaim it the queen's dwelling. There she lies,</l>
<l>The daughter of affliction! whelm'd with woes</l>
<l>So vast, humanity trembles to think her</l>
<l>Of its own species.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MELANTHUS.</speaker>
<l>From the book of fate,</l>
<l>Jove's equal hand to every mortal man</l>
<l>Deals his due portion; be it bliss or woe.</l>
<l>Think not I mean to check thy noble nature:</l>
<l>Thou too art born a man; and as thou art,</l>
<l>Thy soul perforce must melt at human sufferings.</l>
<l>But learn, dear youth, with reverential awe</l>
<l>To kiss heav'n's ministring rod.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>Oh good Melanthus,</l>
<l>Cast but a thought on that illustrious scene</l>
<l>Which once was Troy. Where now her menacing bulwarks?</l>
<l>Rich palaces, proud tow'rs that propt the skies?</l>
<l>Where her intrepid heroes, reverend seers?</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="11"/>All, all are fall'n. Ev'n godlike Priam's fallen,</l>
<l>The good old king. Death's ruthless scythe has swept him,</l>
<l>Amid the general carnage, to the tomb;</l>
<l>Him and his numerous race. But oh ye pow'rs,</l>
<l>If I'm ordain'd to save these royal captives—</l>
<l>If I am sent your aweful delegate</l>
<l>To counteract their fate—they shall be free.</l>
<l>I feel they shall. I come heav'n's minister,</l>
<l>And glory in the sacred embassy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MELANTHUS.</speaker>
<l>Hear me Eriphilus—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>AETHRON.</speaker>
<l>Do not repress</l>
<l>His noble ardor. Here at Chersonesus</l>
<l>The Greeks but stay to raise Achilles' tomb.</l>
<l>That finish'd, the first favoring wind transports</l>
<l>Their fleet to Greece. Go then, illustrious strangers,</l>
<l>Go, like two guardian gods, and sooth their souls.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>I go.—come on, Melanthus; my soul burns</l>
<l>To tell the joyful tidings.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MELANTHUS.</speaker>
<l>Yet bethink thee,</l>
<l>When at Achilles' tomb thou didst unfold</l>
<l>Pyrechmes' will, did Hecuba's redemption</l>
<l>Meet a full promise? Thy impetuous zeal,</l>
<l>Ev'n in the cause of virtue, makes me tremble.</l>
<l>Oh temper it, dear youth. Think on the perils</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="12"/>That lurk around thee on this dreadful isle.</l>
<l>There's not a Greek but, were thy secret known,</l>
<l>Wears for thy life a dagger.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>I'll be calm.</l>
<l>Soon shalt thou find I will.—But shou'd Atrides</l>
<l>Refuse the ransom—by th' immortal pow'rs,</l>
<l>Distress like Hecuba's—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MELANTHUS.</speaker>
<l>The queen's distress</l>
<l>Sinks in my heart as deep as thine, which prompts</l>
<l>My steadiest caution. Trust me, this compliance</l>
<l>With each rash impulse, howsoe'er disguis'd</l>
<l>In friendship's or in virtue's specious form,</l>
<l>Is but mean incense to our own fond passions.</l>
<l>Then calmly to the tent. Back from the port</l>
<l>I shall return, before thou hast dispatch'd</l>
<l>Thy business with the queen. Be quick, be cautious,</l>
<l>Be secret too.—Remember thou hast sworn.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>I have. And pow'rful must the pang be found,</l>
<l>That scorn my soul the secret doth extort.</l>
</sp>
<stage>ULYSSES, ERIPHILUS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Well hast thou sped, brave youth. Soon as the tomb,</l>
<l>Rais'd by our chiefs to great Achilles' shade,</l>
<l>Is finish'd, thou shalt tender to Troy's queen</l>
<l>The first, best gift of Jove, her liberty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>Thanks to the Greeks, the queen will soon be free.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="13"/>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>The princess too thy happy hand leads forth</l>
<l>To gay Paeonia's court. Her eyes will dart</l>
<l>New lustre 'mid the charms that glitter there,</l>
<l>In beauty's brilliant circle.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>Every tongue</l>
<l>Grows rapturous in her praise; speaks her most fair.</l>
<l>Yet not more fair than wise; more wise than virtuous.</l>
<l>The pow'rs of love and wisdom seem to vie,</l>
<l>Which most shou'd deck her minion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Blest the youth,</l>
<l>Who cou'd inspire a heart like hers with love!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>Oh blest indeed, if there be such a youth,</l>
<l>Whose peerless qualities—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Sometimes 'tis seen,</l>
<l>That modest worth shrinks from the proffer'd bliss</l>
<l>Which the soul inly pines for. That's false shame.</l>
<l>There is a time when merit may step forth,</l>
<l>And claim its due reward.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>Surely there is.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Then fear not, gallant youth, that thy mild virtues</l>
<l>Want pow'r to draw from her enchanting eyes</l>
<l>A favoring smile on thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>On me? good heavens,</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="14"/>A favoring smile on me!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>And wherefore not?</l>
<l>Large is her worth; but she's of mortal mould.</l>
<l>And know, that on this sublunary scene</l>
<l>Perfection dwells not. Nature's purest ore</l>
<l>Bears some alloy: nay even yon glorious sun,</l>
<l>Whose quick'ning beams all nature animate,</l>
<l>Oft sends forth barren droughts and purple deaths.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>But she, the princess —</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Think'st thou she enjoys</l>
<l>A sole exemption from a general fate?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>Yes, virtue white as hers —</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>The whitest virtue</l>
<l>'Scapes not unblemish'd. Envy's baleful breath</l>
<l>Soils ev'n the snow that circles Dian's heart:</l>
<l>What wonder therefore, shou'd it brand the princess?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>Oh heavens, for what?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>For that she was accomplice</l>
<l>With Paris in the murder of Achilles,</l>
<l>Ev'n at the sacred shrine, where her base tongue</l>
<l>Plighted the full assurance of her faith.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>Infernal falsehood!</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>How — this bold behaviour</l>
<l>I'll suits thy humble birth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>I am to blame—</l>
<l>But were the villain here, whose sland'rous tongue</l>
<l>Thus wounds my honor —</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Wounds your honor?—yours?—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>Did I say mine? it was too proud a word.</l>
<l>Yet—virtue's is the general cause; 'tis mine;</l>
<l>'Tis yours, oh king; and each affront it bears</l>
<l>Wounds both our honors, and demands revenge.</l>
<l>Polyxena's no murd'rer.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>But should Pyrrhus</l>
<l>Credit the babling rumour; where were then</l>
<l>Thy embassy, young man? might not revenge</l>
<l>Devote her virgin beauties to the bed</l>
<l>Of a vile slave?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>By heav'n he dares not! —</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Dares not?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ERIPHILUS.</speaker>
<l>Is he a king, and dares he prostitute</l>
<l>A subject's virtue? for she's now his subject.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Is he a man, and dares he do a deed</l>
<l>Humanity must shudder but to hear!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ULYSSES.</speaker>
<l>Yet duty to his father's rev'rend shade</l>
<l>May prompt him to confine the captive princess,</l>
<l>Till the doubt's clear'd.—Or haply she may gain</l>
<l>Permission to depart, so the queen stays</l>
<l>A hostage in her stead. And what imports it,</l>

<l>Ye pow'rs, imports it not to the poor queen,</l>
<l>Who tends her sick'ning age? what pious hands</l>

<l>Wash her pale corse, and in the hallow'd urn</l>
