<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>SINCE it is the fate of dramatic works to undergo a much more severe scrutiny than any other of the efforts of the mind; authors, in this predicament, are justifiable in taking every opportunity of speaking in their own behalf, and the egotism should be, and is, by the candid, readily forgiven them. The applauses bestowed upon DUPLICITY, in the Theatre, have equalled my fondest hopes; and self-love itself cannot accuse the auditors of ingratitude, or want of penetration. But though there are scenes happy enough to have given universal satisfaction, there are others that have been called vulgarities, damned stuff, and by other concise and summary epithets, which men accustomed to decide without deigning to reason, have invented and appropriated to their own proper use. I do not mean to affirm there is no truth in these remarks: I am, perhaps, the person least qualified of any to pronounce, with safety, on the merits or demerits of the work. Fathers, who are the most free from prejudice, cannot see
<pb n="iv" facs="4"/>those defects in their offspring, which are obvious to others. In the rapidity of composition, blemishes are suffered to escape, through a laudable attention to things of greater importance; and, like an ugly face, presently become too familiar to be disgusting. It is, for this reason, dangerous to commit any thing to paper, which the judgment, at the first perception, condemns. A work of any consequence is read and reconsidered so repeatedly, that the ideas at last lose both novelty and force, and the writer is disgusted to find those things, which, when first conceived, gave him so much pleasure, become vapid, and assume the appearance of common place. For these reasons, I say, it would be arrogant in me to speak decidedly; I can only alledge what were my original motives for writing as I have done.</p>
<p>The English Comic Drama has long been renowned for humour; and when, about fourteen years ago, the French <hi>Comédie Larmoyante,</hi> or, as we call it, Sentimental Comedy, was introduced, the complaint was, that we had lost all the spirit of our old writers, and were dwindled into mere translators. The town was in this temper when Dr. Goldsinith's Comedy of SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER was produced, in which, humour, alone, seems to be the chief intention of the Author, and which gave a fatal blow to mere sentimental dialogue. The success of this
<pb n="v" facs="5"/>piece rouzed later writers from the soft slumbers of the heart, and wit and humour became commodities in great request. The road to fame, though difficult, was obvious; and it would have been unpardonable for a young traveller, at his first out-set, so far to have mistaken, as not to have attempted it. The difficulties and dangers have increased, however, in a vast proportion. I need only mention the SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL; and every discerning critic will immediately recollect how, and why.</p>
<p>In the Comedy of DUPLICITY, the 'squire and his sister are characters that, in their own nature, cannot admit of delicate strokes; and, if I have erred, it is not, I believe, so much in the colouring, as in the choice of my subject. An Author in his first attempt, is seldom impressed with that awe for the Public which is requisite, but ventures many things, that, perhaps, have their excellencies in reading, but that appear rude, abrupt, or indelicate, when pronounced before a large assembly. Were the humour of Smollet, which never fails to excite laughter in the closet, spoken upon the stage, it would frequently excite universal disgust. Characters of broad humour are become peculiarly hazardous, because they are become far less frequent. A sense of propriety spreads in proportion as people read, and reading is an infallible consequence of riches. This produced
<pb n="vi" facs="6"/>duces delicate sensations in those who have acquired such a strict sense of propriety, and they are offended when they see things represented on the stage which, they suppose, do not exist in real life; though there are a thousand living characters, a thousand incidents at which, if exhibited, an audience would revolt, merely on the score of improbability.</p>
<p>Whatever the execution may have been, the intention of this Comedy is of a far nobler nature than the mere incitement of risibility: the vice it pretends to correct is become truly enormous; and I would rather have the merit of driving one man from the gaming-table, than of making a whole theatre merry.</p>
<p>I have, likewise, been accused by some of imitation, and want of originality. It is said, I have stolen an incident from one piece, and a character from another, and that it is evidently the play of a player. This last remark, I believe, would never have been made, had I not been known to be a player. The accusations, which have the greatest appearance of truth, are, that LE DISSIPATEUR of Monsieur Destouches, and the Tragedy of THE GAMESTER, have furnished the great outlines of the plot. To these I answer, that, were it so, I would make no scruple of avowing it, because I should not think myself degraded by the avowal; but I declare the plot was finished, and almost the comedy,
<pb n="vii" facs="7"/>before I ever read LE DISSIPATEUR: and if I have pillaged the GAMESTER, it was from latent ideas, of which I am unconscious; for I have neither read, nor seen the GAMESTER for many years. A parallel circumstance to that of Sir Harry losing his sister's fortune, is found, I am told, in the GAMESTER; but this incident was added to DUPLICITY since it was first written, by the advice of a friend, to give a strength to the denoument. But there is a story told in the life of Beau Nash, which, had these critics known, would have immediately pointed out the place whence, they might have sworn, without the least suspicion of perjury, I had stolen my plot; and yet, had they sworn, they would have been perjured, for I never read that story till I had written my Play, and then, I confess, I was amazed at the similarity.</p>
<p>However, I repeat, had I taken my plot from any play or story, I should have made no scruple to confess it, because I think it no disgrace. The first of all poets invented none of his plots; I shall never be the second, and yet I affirm I did invent mine; that is, as far as I myself am conscious. The elegant Bishop Hurd, in his discourse on Poetical Imitation, has the following remark, among many others, which is applicable to the present occasion: The objects of imitation, like the materials of human knowledge, are a common stock which experience
<pb n="vii" facs="8"/>furnishes to all men; and it is in the operations of the mind upon them that the glory of poetry, as of science, consists. Here the genius of the poet hath room to shew itself, and from hence, alone, is the praise of originality to be ascertained.</p>
<p>The Comedy is now committed to the impartial judgment of the true critic; and I have only to wish, it may receive as favourable a sentence from him, as it has already experienced from the voice of an indulgent Public.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by Mr. NICHOLSON,</byline>
<stage>and spoken by Mr. LEE-LEWES.</stage>
<sp>
<l>RASH was the wight, who first, in hollow'd tree,</l>
<l>Daring, resolv'd to tempt the treach'rous sea!</l>
<l>Hungry the wretch, who, forth from shelly cloister,</l>
<l>First drew and swallowed down—a living oyster!</l>
<l>But far more rash and daring is THAT wight,</l>
<l>Who, in this polish'd age, attempts to write:</l>
<l>Long may his hunger last, who pines for fame,</l>
<l>Who seeks that hard-earn'd morsel, call'd—A NAME!</l>
<l>A morsel clos'd within a scaly guard</l>
<l>Of critic shells, obdurate, rough, and hard!</l>
<l>Well fare the bard, whose fortitude, sedate,</l>
<l>Stands, unappall'd, before impending fate;</l>
<l>When cat-call-pipers, groaners, whistlers, grinners,</l>
<l>Assembled, sit to judge of SCRIBBLING SINNERS!</l>
<l>What mortal mind can keep its terrors under</l>
<l>When gods sit arm'd, with awful—wooden thunder?</l>
<l>What heart, so brave, can check its palpitation,</l>
<l>Before, the grave dispensers of damnation:</l>
<l>Or who, in danger of such mighty evil,</l>
<l>Would not turn Indian, and adore the devil?</l>
<stage>[Bows.</stage>
<l>Various have been the stratagems and wiles,</l>
<l>Display'd in prologues, to obtain your smiles.</l>
<l>Some make the stage an inn; and hope to bribe,</l>
<l>With curious feast, the turtle-eating tribe:</l>
<l>Make vain attempts, in metaphor, to treat,</l>
<l>But metaphor is unsubstantial meat.</l>
<l>So bold harpooners, if their oars should fail,</l>
<l>Toss out an empty tub, to amuse the whale.</l>
<l>Others more mean, implore, in whining style,</l>
<l>That tender pity may your hearts beguile;</l>
<l>Bespeak applause, by way of deprecation,</l>
<l>And think that fame is charity's donation.</l>
<l>So dastard curs provoke the mastiff's bite,</l>
<l>Then fawn and cringe to shun th' unequal fight.</l>
<l>Our author hopes, by honest means, to gain</l>
<l>Plaudits which merit never ask'd in vain:</l>
<l>Should such biest claim be his, he need not fear,</l>
<l>He knows your candour;—Party dwells not here!</l>
<l>Patient to your decision he'll submit,</l>
<l>Nor wish to bribe the arbiters of wit.</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> CLARA <hi>and</hi> MELISSA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>WELL, my dear Melissa, you will be a happy woman!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>I have no doubt of it. The attention which Mr. Osborne has shewn me, was not that of a man eager to gain the affection of his mistress by humouring her caprices, praising her beauty, and flattering her follies. He is obliging and well-bred, but sincere; yet his disapprobation is delivered with a delicacy that makes it more agreeable than some people's compliments.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>If time, instead of mellowing the strokes, should wear away this smooth varnish and discover a harsh outline, should you not be offended at the severity of his manner, think you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>Believe me, dear Clara, there is no danger; for if there be one man on earth more capable of making a woman happy than another it is Mr. Osborne.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>It would be heresy in you, my dear, to hold any other opinion; and I have no doubt but you will continue orthodox after marriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>Yes—I shall certainly die in that faith.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Your brother, Sir Harry, I believe, is of your religion too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>Entirely—The friendship of Mr. Osborne and my brother is as sincere as the commencement of it was remarkable—Have you ever heard their story?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Never. You know my acquaintance with your family is but just begun; but, I hope, you will not think them words of course when I assure you that, short as it is, I feel myself interested in its happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I am sure you are sincere—I know it by sympathy—Well then, I'll tell you—Harry and Osborne happened to be both abroad at the same time. As my brother was going to Italy, and passing through the mountainous part of Savoy, he came to a hollow way, among the rocks, surrounded by trees and caverns. All on a sudden, at a turning in the road, he beheld Osborne, and his servants, attacked by six banditti, and ready to sink under their wounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Was Sir Harry alone?</p>
<stage>(<hi>alarmed.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>He had his governor, two servants, and the postillion—My brother instantly leaped from his carriage, snatched up his sword and pistols, andflew to the place of action.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>I declare you terrify me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>He was not seen by the combatants, and took care to advance so near, before he
<pb n="3" facs="13"/>fired, that he could not fail to do execution—He laid two of the banditti dead; and their companions, who had discharged their fire-arms, and beheld Sir Harry's people running to the attack and levelling their pieces, fled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Thank you for that, my dear—you have given me breath.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>The intrepidity with which Sir Harry saw Osborne defend himself, and the fortitude he discovered when he was informed, as it was at first believed, that his wounds were mortal, attached my brother so powerfully to him, that he resolved not to leave him in the hands of strangers, but anxiously waited while he was under cure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>This was a noble generosity!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>It was; and Osborne was so sensible of it that, though he was going the other way, he would return with Sir Harry into Italy; and their friendship has continued ever since.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>But is it not strange, my dear, that he cannot detach his friend, Sir Harry, from the GAMING-TABLE?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa</speaker>
<p>My brother is insatuated—It is his greatest, almost his only weakness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>But the report is, that Mr. Osborne takes advantage of this weakness; that, while he publicly satirizes the practice, he privately benefits by his superior address; and, in fact, has half ruined Sir Harry HIMSELF.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>The report of malice, my dear.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Sir HARRY PORTLAND <hi>and</hi> Mr. OSBORNE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ladies, your obedient—Pray when did you arrive in town, Madam?</p>
<stage>(<hi>To Clara.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Yesterday—But how came you to quit Bath so suddenly, Gentlemen? I understood you intended to stay another week, and you were gone before me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Mr. Osborne, Madam, was <hi>horriblement ennuyé</hi>—dull as an alderman at church, or a fat lap-dog after dinner—thinking on marriage, Melissa, and other momentous matters; and so—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, Sir Harry, this is mighty ingenious; but you were, at least, as willing to be gone as myself—The truth, Madam, is, my MODEST friend, here, heard YOU were to set off in a day or two; and, from that moment, was continually giving hints, and asking me how I, as a lover, could exist so long without a sight of my mistress; and, in short, began, all at once, to talk so sympathetically about absence and ages, that I, who had made the excursion purely to oblige him, was, I acknowledge, exceedingly happy to find I could oblige him by returning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>What say you to this, Sir Harry?—But, I know your politeness—you will confess it all to be true, and begin to say civil things upon the subject, that will only put me to the trouble of blushing and curtsying; so we'll suppose them all if you please—But come, tell me—what's the news of the day?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>News! Oh, that's true—Look here, my dear!—I thought I had something to tell you— <stage>(<hi>reads a paragraph in a newspaper</hi>)</stage>—We hear, from very good authority, that a hymeneal treaty is concluded between a certain beautiful ward, not a mile from St. James's Square, and her old guardian; and that the lady is expected in town from Bath, every hour, to sign and seal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>What say you to this, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Say! I protest I don't know what to say!—except that these NEWSMAKERS are a very pleasant, ingenious kind of people.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>But a'n't you angry?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Angry! no indeed. I am sure I am very much obliged to them, for thinking of me—I shall be so stared at—I'll go into public continually, and my guardian shall go with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>But is there any foundation for this report, my dear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I am sure I can't tell: there may be, for aught I know—I have suspected the matter a great while, you must know, by my guardian's simpering and squeézing my hand so often—then, he is continually talking about METHUSELAH, and the ANTEDILUVIANS, and making systems to convince me how much stronger, and longer lived, some men are than others—He read, the other day, in the ANNUAL REGISTER, of a man, at INVERNESS, who lived to the age of one hundred and seventeen; and he has been talking, ever since, of purchasing a country seat in the HIGHLANDS.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>That would be pleasant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Very—Then we should have a flock of GOATS, I suppose!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>DORASTUS and FAUNIA.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Oh yes—quite in the DAMON and PHILIDA way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>You are very happy in a lover, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Exceedingly—quite proud of my conquest—There is no such great miracle in bringing a young fellow, whose passions are all afloat, to die at ones feet—The thing's so natural that one does it every day—But to thaw the icy blood
<pb n="6" facs="16"/>of a grave old gentleman, to see him simper, sigh, dance minuets, and look ridiculous for one—Oh! there is, positively, no flattery equal to it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>He will make your winter evenings in the HIGHLANDS quite entertaining, with relating the wild pranks he committed, and the deeds of prowess he was guilty of in his youth—then you will be so delighted with listening to his raptures, and tasting his panada, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Oh yes—yes, yes—ha, ha—I—I think I see him now, with his venerable bald head, his shrivelled face, and his little pug nose, that looks as red and as bright as the best Dutch sealing-wax, rising from his chair, by the help of his crutch-headed stick, to breathe forth vows of love and everlasting fidelity—Ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>It's whimsical enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Yes—Oh, now you talk of whimsical, I was accosted by an old gentleman, the night before I left Bath, in the rooms, who was the drollest being, and had the most agreeable kind of whimsicallity about him, I ever met with—I thought he would have made love to me—swore I was an angel, and said a thousand civil things—quite galant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Madam, the old men are the only polite men of this age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word, I begin to think so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>The young ones, taught in the modern school, hold a rude familiarity to be the first principle of good breeding.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Manners, like point ruffles, are now most fashionable when they are soiled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>No, no—they only hang the easier for being deprived of starch—But who was this old gentleman, pray, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="17"/>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>A relation of yours, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Of mine, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>I should suppose so, for he mentioned his nephew, Sir Harry Portland.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>Our uncle, Sir Hornet Armstrong.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>It is—I found a letter from him, when I came to town, in which he informed me, he should arrive in Bath the very day we left it.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Who brought this?</p>

<p>It came by the post, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit Servant.</stage>
<stage>(<hi>Sir Harry reads the letter, and seems surprized.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>I die to be better acquainted with him—I must have him in my train of sighing swains.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>You seem astonished, Sir Harry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Some unkind billet from his mistress, I suppose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>No, indeed; it is the most unaccountable epistle I ever received, and from my unaccountable uncle too—There, read, read.</p>

You know, you dog, how your old uncle loves you—You will say so, when you are thoroughly acquainted with the occasion of this—In brief—I met with a young lady at Bath, the most extraordinary, take her all together, I ever beheld—She is a nonpareil! a phoenix!—But you will judge for yourself—She is coming up to town with her brother; who, by the bye, is a country booby—but that's no matter—I saw her only once, and that was in the rooms; but once is sufficient—They intended coming up to London, by way of seeing the town, for the are
<pb n="8" facs="18"/>country people I find, though the sister has more accomplishments, ease and good-breeding, than I ever yet saw in the drawing-room—I proposed a match to the brother, and he seemed happy at the offer—They will arrive nearly as soon as this, for they set out before it; and I shall follow, maugre the gout, as fast as I can.<lb/>
HORNET ARMSTRONG.<lb/>
P. S. I forgot to mention, their name is Turnbull.—</p>
<p>TURNBULL! why, what, in the devil's name, is Sir Hornet mad!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>In one of his right antient whims, I suppose—Sir Hornet has had many such in his time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>But pray, who is this miraculous lady, Mr. Osborne? for you seem to know something of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Do you remember, Sir Harry, a gawky girl, that stalked round the rooms, and stared prodigiously—she that was stuck to the side of a bobwig'd country 'squire?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Oh!—what the—the wench with her arms dangling, her chin projecting, and her mouth open—dressed in the—red ribband, tawdry stile; and that looked as if she were afraid of being lost.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes—or as if she durst not trust herself alone, out of her own parish, lest somebody should catch her, put her in a sack, and send her for a present to the king of the Cannibals.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>The same—that is the accomplished Miss Turnbull.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>How!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>That is the easy, well-bred, drawingroom lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="19"/>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,—well— <stage>(<hi>with an affected gravity</hi>)</stage>—and I don't doubt but she would make a sort of a—a—a very good wife—Understands the arts of brewing, baking, pickling of pork, curing of hung beef, darning of stockings, and other branches of housewifery, in perfection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh, no doubt—Is perfectly skilled too in the science of feeding the pigs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Yes—and will make her own and her husband's linen, and do all the needle-work and quilting at home—believes in ghosts, and has got the wandering Prince of Troy, the Babes in the Wood, and the entertaining dialogue of Death and the Lady, by heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Such, and so numerous, are the wifelike properties of MISS BARBARA TURNBULL.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>TURNBULL, too!—Well, that is such a delightful name, for a country lady—so pastoral!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>The father was one of the greatest graziers in the west of England; and was so intent on getting money, that he bred his children in the most stupid ignorance—He is lately dead, and the son has commenced gentleman and 'squire, by virtue of the father's industry, and a pack of fox-hounds; and though he has scarce knowledge enough of articulate sounds to hold a dialogue with his own geese, yet does he esteem himself a devilish shrewd fellow, and a wit—His conversation is vociferous, and patched up of proverbs, and out-of-the-way sayings, which he strings together without order or connection; and utters, upon all occasions, and in all companies, without respect to time, place, or person.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, Sir Harry, I shall have to wish you joy soon, I suppose—but I must be gone—fifty visits to make this morning—time flies
<pb n="10" facs="20"/>—butagreeable company, and all that, you know—Oh, Sir Harry, you mean to attend the spring meetings this year, at Newmarket—I am told you understand the turf—I think of sending a venture of five hundred by somebody—But I shall see you often enough before then—Adieu.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Exeunt Clara and Melissa.</stage>
<stage>[Manent Sir Harry and Osborne.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, what do you think of this lady, Osborne?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>I think her a very amiable, accomplished lady; and one that, under an assumed levity, observes and understands every thing about her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am entirely of your opinion—If I may judge from an acquaintance of such short date, she is the first woman in the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Except one, Sir Harry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>You, Osborne, may make exceptions, if you please—I am not so captious—She has beauty without vanity, virtue without prudery, fashion without affectation, wit without malice, gaiety without coquetry, humour—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Hold, hold—stop to breathe—How was it? Vinegar without acid, fire without heat, light without shade, motion without matter, and a likeness without a feature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>"Spite—by the Gods!—proud spite and burning envy."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>But did you observe her Newmarket hint, Sir Harry; and the concealed significance with which it was delivered?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>I did.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Which being faithfully done into English, bears this interpretation:—"I Clara Forrester, a beautiful, elegant, sensible girl,
<pb n="11" facs="21"/>with a fine fortune, should like to take you, Harry Portland, with youth, spirit, and certain et ceteras, but"—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>"But that I am afraid of indulging a partiality for any man, who is so intolerably addicted to gaming"—Is not that the conclusion of your speech?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Oh fie! No, no, gaming!—That man has a body without a soul, that never felt an inclination to gaming.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Perhaps so; but that man has the greatest soul, who can best resist that inclination.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw!—;Gaming is the essence of fashion, and one of your strongest recommendations—Clara is a girl of spirit, and what girl that comes under that description, would ever place her affections on a sneaking, sober, prudent fellow—a mechanical scoundrel, that knows the day of the month, sips tea, keeps a pew in the parish church, writes memorandums, and goes to bed at eleven o'clock—Poh! absurd!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Curse me, Osborne, if I know what to make of you—You are a riddle that I cannot expound. You have such an aukward way of praising gaming, that it always has the appearance of satire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Satire! how so? Do you think I'd satirize myself? Who sports more freely than I do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why there's the mystery!—You are as eager, to the full, as I am—If I set an hundred on a back hand, you offer a thousand; nay, had I the fortune of a Nabob, and were to stake it all, you would be the first man to cry cover'd, and be damned mad if any one wanted to go a guinea—Not because you have not generosity, but in the true and inveterate spirit of gaming.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="22"/>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Certainly—Gaming!—why gaming is the best sal volatile for the spleen—It rouzes the spirits, agitates the blood, quickens the pulse, and puts the whole nervous system in a continual vibration—No man ever yet died of an apoplexy, that loved a box and dice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>But they have died as suddenly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Oh! ay, ay, but that's a fashionable disease, an influenza; that's to make your exit with eclat; that's to go out of the world with a good report.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>True—true—and indeed, as to a few years, more or less, that is, in reality, a mighty insignificant circumstance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>A bagatelle!—Let us live while we do live, and die when we can't live any longer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>That's my comfort—that's my comfort—Yes—yes—a pistol!—a pistol is a very certain remedy for the cholic—Nobody but a pitiful scoundrel would go sighing, and whining, and teizing other people with his griefs and complaints.—When a man is weary, what should he do but go to sleep?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>To be sure—Life itself is but a dream—'Tis only sleeping a little sounder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>What! live to be pitied!—Ha, ha—A decayed gentleman! No, no, no—A withered branch—a firelock without a flint—And yet—heigho!—this Clara—damn it—its provoking—Youth—beauty—affability—she's a bewitching girl!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>She is indeed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>A lovely girl!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Ay—enough so to make any man, that might hope to be in her favour, in love with life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Any man, any man—but me—no, no—Undone—undone—undone—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="23"/>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Well but, seriously, since you have such bad success, why don't you renounce play?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Tis too late—I have sunk eighty thousand—My resources almost all exhausted, my estates all mortgaged to Jews and scoundrels.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>All!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>All; except the estate in Kent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Well then, if you cannot content yourself with your present loss, your best way will be to make another vigorous push.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>That's exactly what I am determined to do; and, unless the devil possesses the dice, I think I may expect, without a miracle, that fortune should change hands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>One would think so, indeed—Will you dine then at my house? There will be the Chevalier, the Baron, and the usual set—They have engaged to dine with me—They are spirited fellows, and will play for any sum.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>I don't know—Suspicion is a curst meanness; and yet, I cannot help having my doubts of some among that company—Nay, had you not so often assured me you were perfectly acquainted with them all—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Why, I tell you again and again, so I am—I will be answerable for their conduct, and that's more than I would say for any other set of gamblers upon earth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, well—I'll meet you there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>We dine early—at five.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Agreed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>And then—hey for a light heart, and a heavy purse.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit Osborne.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>No, no,—No light heart for me—I am sunk—degraded in my own opinion—Gaming alters our very nature—Osborne used to hate it—he was then an open-hearted, generous
<pb n="14" facs="24"/>fellow—he now appears to have contracted an insatiable love for money, and a violent desire to win—he cares not of whom—of me as soon as another—Were I in his situation, and he in mine, I think I should find an aversion to increase his distress—he knows mine, yet has no such aversion—Perhaps he thinks my ruin certain, and that he may as well profit by it as another—I know him to have the most refined and strictest sense of honour—I have lost most of my money to him, and in his company, and therefore have not been duped out of it.—That is some comfort, however.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Well, Mr. Timid, has Sir Harry sent to you for a further supply?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Timid.</speaker>
<p>Lackaday, Sir, yes!—And a very large supply too—He wants 5000<hi>l.</hi> immediately—Lackaday! I asked him how he thought it possible for me to raise such sums, as he called upon me for every day—reminded him what a bad way his affairs were in, and what an usurious rate I was obliged to borrow all this money at.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>What said he?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Timid.</speaker>
<p>Lackaday—not much—seemed chagrined—said it must have an end, one way or another, soon; and demanded, whether I could, or could not, raise the money—Lackaday—I told him, I was no longer master of ways and means; and he said, then he must positively employ another prime minister, for supplies he must have.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Why did you tell him that? Go to him, inform him you have met with a tender-hearted
<pb n="15" facs="25"/>Jew, who knows nothing of the situation of his affairs, that will lend him 10,000 directly, if he wants it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Timid.</speaker>
<p>Ten thousand!—on what terms?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Oh, the mortgage of the Kentish estate.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Timid.</speaker>
<p>The Kentish estate!—Lackaday—But suppose he should go to gaming, and lose it to somebody else instead of you.</p>

<p>Oh, I'll take care of that.</p>

<p>Don't you think, Sir, that were my sister's affections totally disengaged, this abruptness were very unlikely to gain them? Is it not too violent, think you, for female delicacy?</p>

<p>Why to be zure—vemale delicacy!—I hate it—and as vor your abruptness, why gi' me the man that speaks bolt outright—I am vor none o' your abruptness—what tho'—he must a' leave to speak that can't hold his tongue.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Clara is very beautiful—but mankind is very censorious—They will tell me, that sixtyseven is too late in life to undertake the begetting, bringing up, and providing for a family—What of that—Must I go out of the world, as I came into it—no body to remember me?—Must I leave no pretty picture of myself?—Sixty-seven is but sixty-seven—Have not we a thousand examples of longevity upon record?—And then—as to cuckolds—I cannot be persuaded that they are as common now, as they were when I was a youngster—Times, men, and manners alter—Children are born wittier, and the world gets more sedate—I myself am a living proof of it—I never go to bagnios now—I never break lamps, beat watchmen, and kick constables now—Once, indeed, I should have made very little ceremony about dignifying an elderly gentleman, that had a handsome wife; whereas now, I can lay my hand upon my heart, and with a safe conscience declare, I have no such wicked inclinations—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> CLARA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Ah! mon cher papa! What ruminating!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Ah! Turtle! But why do you always call me papa? you know I don't like that word, Turtle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="24" facs="34"/>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>And why papa, do you always call me turtle?—Have not I told you, fifty times, it puts me in mind of calipash—and aldermen—and other ugly animals.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Calipash! Thou art sweeter, tenderer, more delicate, delightful and delicious, than all the calipash and callipee in the universe—A gem—a jewel—that all the Sophy's, Sultans, Grand Signiors and Great Moguls, of the whole earth, have not riches enough to purchase.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Ah! Mon cher Papa!—You are so gallant—You do say the most obliging things!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>SAY the most obliging things!—Ay and will—No matter—Deeds—Title deeds—Rent rolls—India bonds—Well—Death, and the day of judgment, will make strange discoveries.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes!—I know you wise men often meditate on these serious subjects.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Ay—Life is treacherous ground—One foot firm, and the next in a pit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>But why so melancholy, papa?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>I have no friends—that is, no relations—no children—have made a great fortune, by care, and labour, and anxiety, and debarring myself the pleasures, and comforts of life, in my youth—And why should not I sit down and enjoy it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Very true, and why don't you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Because men are fools, and laugh they don't know why—I hate ridicule—Nobody loves to be thought ridiculous—The world has got false notions—A man of fifty is called old, and must not be in love, for fear of being pointed at—Whereas some men are older at thirty, than others at threescore.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Certainly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>What is threescore?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>A handful of minutes!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>That come you don't know how.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>And go you don't know where.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Surely a man of sixty may walk thro' a church-yard, without fear of tumbling into a grave?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>If he can jump over it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>True—And I was once an excellent jumper—Sixty!—Why Henry Jenkins, the Yorkshire fisherman, lived to a hundred and sixtynine—So that a man of sixty, even in these degenerate days, has a chance to live at least an hundred years.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Well, I declare papa, you are quite a blooming youth!—forty years younger, in my opinion, than you were a quarter of an hour ago!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Forty?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>At least!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Why then, by dad, as thou sayest, I am a blooming youth—Ah turtle!—I could tell you something—that would surprize you—I could tell you—Think what I could tell you— <stage>(Sings)</stage>"If'tis joy to wound a lover"—hem—"how much more to give him ease."</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Me a wit!—Lord, papa—I would not be such an animal for the world—A wit!—Why a wit is a kind of urchin, that every man
<pb n="26" facs="36"/>will set his dog at, but won't touch himself, for fear of pricking his fingers.—A wit is a monster, with a hideous long tongue, and no brains—A dealer in paradoxes—One that is blind, thro' a profusion of light—A wit is a spectre, that makes a pair of stilts of his criss-cross-row, walks upon metaphor, is always seen in a simile, vanishes if you come too near him, and is only to be laid by a cudgel.</p>

<p>A person that lived several years in our family. She is, at present, lady's maid to Melissa, Sir Harry Portland's sister—She will divert me with her fine language, besides that, I wish to ask her how she likes Sir Harry's family.</p>
</sp>

<p>I know Sir Harry's uncle, Sir Hornet Armstrong, very well—an old friend.</p>

<p>This Sir Harry runs continually in my head—ay, and I am afraid has sound a place in my heart—yes, yes—there's no denying that—but that FRIEND—that Mr. OSBORNE—Whether it be my particular concern for Sir Harry, or my superior penetration, I cannot discover, but that man wears, to me, a most suspicious, hypocritical face. <stage>(<hi>Enter Mrs. Trip</hi>)</stage> So, Mrs. Trip, how have you done this long time?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Trip.</hi></speaker>
<p>Pretty well, thank you, Madam, except that I am subject to the historicals, and troubled with the vapours; being, as I am, of a dilikut nirvus system, whereof I am so giddy, that my poor head is sometimes quite in a whirlpool; and if I did not bathe with my lady, the doctor tells me, I should decline into a liturgy, and so fall down and die, perhaps, in a fit of apostacy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>And how long have you lived in Sir Harray's family, Mrs. Trip?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. <hi>Trip.</hi></speaker>
<p>I came soon after my poor dear lady, your mamma, died, and was interrogated; whereof I was at her funereal—My lady is a very good lady, that is, I mean, Ma'am, my future lady that I live with at present—she is to be married soon, to Mr. Osborne, and may Hydra, the god of marriage, tie the Gorgon knot—whereof I heard your ladyship is to be one of the ceremonials.</p>

<p>I am invited, and shall be there—But pray, Mrs. Trip, what is your opinion of Mr. Osborne?</p>

<p>Upon my soul, I can't help laughing; and yet the more I reflect on the affair, the more I am amazed—Sir Hornet is whimsical, 'tis true, but no fool.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Fool! Sir Harry!—no, no, he is always the readiest to spy the fooleries of other people—many a time have I laughed at his whims and jokes—an odd mortal he is.</p>
</sp>

<p>Nay, if he be so fond of a joke, who knows but he may have sent them on this errand, for the joke's sake,</p>

<p>But I thought, when I left you, you were coming to an eclaircissement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Coming to an eclaircissement!—Why I told them, as plain as I could speak, that no alliance whatever could take place between the families.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>'Tis certain they have not understood you then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, there the matter must rest, till I can find an interpreter, for I can't make myself more intelligible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>And you have not had one tender love scene yet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Not one—I am amazed at the girl's simplicity—it equals her ignorance—she speaks and looks so totally unconscious of impropriety, so void of intentional error, that I don't know how to reply.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Suppose then you were to practise a little—Come, I'll stand up for the young lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>I shall still find a difficulty to speak.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Surely!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>In very truth, Ma'am.—But it will be from a quite different motive.</p>

<p>Oh, for the love of curiosity, Sir Harry, explain your motive.</p>

<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Cannot! Sir Harry, why so?</p>

<p>Nay, don't be afraid, Sir Harry.—My turtle knows how to answer interrogatories—you won't find her a simpleton, I'll warrant.</p>

<p>What do you mean, Sir Hornet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Mean, my angel! why here has been a bantering, lying, aenigmatical son of a scoundrel, with a bundle of ironical, diabolical tales, railing at your beauty and accomplishments, till egad, I began to fancy my fine-flavoured pineapple a crab.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>This is delightful!—I half suspected this, from the first—But the mistake is so pleasant, that I cannot find in my heart to undeceive him <stage>(aside)</stage>.—There is no answering for the difference of taste, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>True—Asses prefer thistles to nectarines—But yet he must be an ass indeed, who could not distinguish St. Paul's from the pillory.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Taste, Sir Hornet, is a sort of shot silk, and has a variety of shades—a camelion—one says 'tis blue, another black, and a third is positive 'tis yellow—every body has it, yet nobody can tell what it is—Like space, it is undescribable, tho' all allow there is such a thing—It would be a vain attempt, therefore, for Miss Turnbull to endeavour to please the whole world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>An old booby—I would not give a hair of the pope's beard to please him—But how is it with Sir Harry—Is HE in raptures? Is HE dying for you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="40" facs="50"/>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir—he eats and drinks as usual, and is, for aught I can discover, in tolerable good health.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Is he!—an audacious dog!—in good health!—If I find him in good health, I'll pistol him—But you mistake the matter, perhaps—The rascal's proud, and not willing you should see his sufferings—He is a stricken deer, and sheds his tears in solitude and silence, mayhap—Do you discover no symptoms of the sighing swain?—Does he never cut his fingers—or scald himself—or run against a post, and beg its pardon?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>I doubt he is a sad dog—But no—no, no—I am certain he adores you—'Tis impossible he should do otherwise—But there is another material point, about which I am not quite so certain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>What is that, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Has he found any place in your affections?—'Tis true, he's a fine fellow—I don't mean, by that, one that is pickled in cosmetics—preserved in musk and marechal powder, and that will melt away, like Lot's wife, in the first hard shower—None of your fellows that are too valiant to give a woman the wall, and too witty to let her have the last word—But one that is—In short, his own manner will best describe what he is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>True, Sir Hornet, but the time has been so short.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Short!—Ah, Madam, if he did not do the business with a <hi>coup d'oeil</hi>—at once—I would not give a feather of a goose-wing for all the arrows his Cupid has in his quiver—But come, Miss Turnbull—I know you are above the silly prejudices that ordinary minds are swayed by—
<pb n="41" facs="51"/>tell me sincerely—Has he made any impression on your heart?—Is he the man?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>To speak ingenuously, Sir Hornet, that is a point entirely undetermined, at present.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Undetermined!—why!—what!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Sir Harry's person is engaging, his manners delightful, and his understanding unexceptionable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Bravo! my dear girl!—you charm me to hear you say so!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>I will say more, Sir Hornet—I find my heart interested in his behalf, and, sincerely believe, I shall never see another man with whom I could be half so happy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>My dear Miss Turnbull!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>But yet, I have too many reasons to fear, it will be impossible we should ever be united.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Impossible!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>I do most firmly believe, Sir Harry possesses a thousand virtues, but they are all tinged, discoloured by a failing, which if not in its own nature as erroneous as some other vices, is more destructive than any.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>I understand you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>This will for ever deter a woman, who values her own peace and welfare, from cherishing a passion that must, in its consequences, be so fatal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>But you, my angel, will soon cure him of this—It is not a rooted vice—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Permanently—or my intelligence says false—When he loses, there is no possibility of persuading him to desist—the recollection of his loss preys upon his mind, and had he the Indies, he would set it upon the chance of a card, the turn of a guinea, or the cast of a die.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, but we have hopes that Mr. Osborne will find means to reclaim him—he is
<pb n="42" facs="52"/>continually with him, continually warning him, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Subtlety, and refined artifice!—Mr. Osborne, Sir Hornet, is an interested physician, and would rather encourage than cure the disease.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Heaven forbid!—But who informs you of this!</p>
</sp>

<p>Those who are in the secret, I assure you, Sir—I am afraid Mr. Osborne is a wicked man—He is—what I dare not speak.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>I confess you alarm me, tho' I hope without cause—Osborne assumes every appearance of rigid virtue; and, if this were true, he would be the worst of villains—However, suspend your opinion awhile—I'll soon sift the affair—And, in the mean time, let me beg of you to think as well of Sir Harry as your doubts will permit you.</p>

<p>I shall do that, Sir Hornet, without an effort.</p>

<p>Why, turtle!—why,—Ah! Sir Hornet—I am glad to see you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ah, ha—friend Van!—Why you look tolerably well.</p>

<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Tolerably well!—Ay, to be sure—Why should I not?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why should you not?—Let me see—There are, as near as I can guess, about seventy reasons why you should not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Humph—Oh—what my age!—No, no—Let me tell you, Sir Hornet, I—I am not an old man.</p>

<p>Indeed!—I am exceedingly glad of that—and pray when did you make this discovery?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Make it—why I have been making it these twenty years and upwards.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh, ho!—And how do you prove it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>By comparison and reflection—I'll tell you—hold—first I'll shew you—what I call MY list of worthies—there—look at that—</p>

<p>There's a fellow!—I warrant that man is alive and hearty at this moment.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Humph!—And pray, do you think to imitate this worthy, as you call him?—Will you be married seven times, and have a hundred and twenty-three children?</p>

<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Very well now tell me—When you compare me to Johannes de Temporibus, that is, when you compare sixty-seven to three hundred threescore and one, can you say I am an old man?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>An old man!—By the beard of Methuselah thou art scarce an infant—it will be perhaps these five years yet before thou art perfectly a child.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir Hornet, let me beg of you to be serious—you are an old friend, and know the world—I shall be glad of your advice—I ruminate on these things by myself, till I am quite melancholy—Now, if I had but somebody to bear half my griefs, I should suppose—they would be lessened.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why true, as you say, one would imagine so.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Don't you think then, if I were to take a handsome—young—wife—I should, perhaps, find a cure for all my ills?</p>

<p>Most reverend youth, I beg your pardon, ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>You see things in a mighty strange light, Sir Hornet.—Is it any miracle that a man should love a beautiful woman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!—love! Why thou'rt another AEtna—Cupid's burning mountain.—Your nose has took fire at your fancy, and is become a beacon, to warn all young Gentlemen, of threefcore and ten, of the rocks and quicksands hid in the sea of amorous desires.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Upon my word, Sir Hornet, this is exceedingly strange.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Now, let us be serious.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>And I'll tell you a story.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>There was a certain antient personage, of my acquaintance, called Andrew Vandervelt—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>What's your story about me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Give me leave, young gentleman, and you shall hear—Every body imagined him to be a prudent, sedate, grave person, with a moderate share of common sense;</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>And, as it was evident his beard was grey, his limbs palsied, his skin shriveled, and his sinews shrunk;</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>How, Sir Hornet!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>They naturally concluded, he had made his will, wrote his epitaph, and bespoke his coffin;</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Mercy upon me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>But instead of meditating, like a pious Christian, on the four last things, a crotchet takes him in the head, he buys a three-penny fiddle, scrapes a matrimonial jigg, claps a pair of horns upon his head, and curvets thro' the town,
<pb n="47" facs="57"/>the sport of the mob, derided by the young, pitied by the old, and laughed at by all the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Heaven deliver me, what a picture! But you forget, Sir Hornet—Didn't I explain to you, that it was only a joke?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh! true—Ah, witty rogue!—well—adieu—I'll remember the joke—ha! ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Ay, do—ha! ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh! for a song to the tune of "Room for Cuckolds!"</p>

<p>You are the cause, Sir.</p>

<p>I!</p>

<p>Yes, you—There, read, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<stage>(reads)</stage>
<p>—Beware of a false friend—the person who gives you this caution, would sacrifice a life to preserve you from the destruction that threatens you—Mr. Osborne is in league with Jews and sharpers, and you are a victim to his avarice and duplicity.—So, so— <stage>(<hi>seems chagrined</hi>)</stage>—Well, Sir Harry, do you give any credit to this epistle?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir, you are to tell me how much, or how little, credit it deserves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Why look you, Sir Harry, I cannot, nor I will not, enter into explanations—</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>

<p>Yes, Sir, shall.</p>

<p>Ay, Sir—Who is he that SHALL make me?</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Friendship, honour, honesty, ought to make you—but present appearances declare you void of these.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Present appearances declare you void of reason, Sir, otherwise you would remember me for one of those who are not to be terrified by a loud tongue, or an angry brow—I repeat it—I will not now enter into explanations—I have
<pb n="50" facs="60"/>played with you, I have staked MY money, and won YOURS—Would it have been dishonourable had you won mine? I have disposed of that money as I thought proper.—No matter whether with Jews or Christians; and, I should have supposed, your passion and suspicion would have required better proof, than the malevolent asperson of an anonymous letter, ere they ought to have incited you to a quarrel with your friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>I beg your pardon, dear Osborne—I am to blame—nothing but the severity of my late losses can plead for me—I know you to be a noble-hearted, worthy fellow, and explanations, on such an accusation, are as much beneath you to give, as me to demand—forget my silly warmth, it is my weakness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Do you forget the cause on't, Harry, and it is forgot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>It was madness—I am above suspicion—'tis ungenerous—'tis damnable—pray excuse—pray forgive me.</p>

<p>Oh, brother, I am glad I have found you—Why did you send these troublesome things to me? Why did not you take care of them for me? Trust a giddy girl indeed with a parcel of bank bills—here, here, here they are—take 'em—take 'em—they will be safe with you—I have been in a panic, ever since they were in my possession,
<pb n="51" facs="61"/>lest they should take wing, and fly thro' the key-hole, or some other unaccountable way—I am unused to such large sums, and don't feel happy while they are about me.</p>

<p>Well, but, sister, Melissa. She's gone—flown on the light wings of innocence and happiness—while I, depressed by .folly, feel a weight upon my heart, that hope itself cannot remove.—What is a ruined gamester?—An ideot—who begins for his amusement, who continues hoping to retrieve, and who is ruined before he can recollect himself—a wretch—deserted, solitary, forlorn—ashamed of society, yet miserable when alone—shunned by the prosperous—despised by the prudent—deservedly exposed to the poisoned shafts of insolence and envy—a byeword to the vulgar, and a jest to the fortunate—haunted by duns, preyed upon by usurers, persecuted and curst by creditors.—Inexplicable infatuation!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why, Harry, you dog, what have you hid yourself, because you would not see me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Dear Sir, I am exceedingly glad to see you, but it is not a quarter of an hour since I heard of your being in town; and I suppose, Sir, you will scarcely be angry at finding me in this company—</p>
</sp>
<stage>(<hi>Vandervelt, Sir Harry, and Miss Turnbull, walk up the stage in conversation.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Finding you in!—Zounds, what aukward cargo of rusticity has he got there?</p>
<stage>(<hi>To Clara.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>A young lady from Somersetshire, with a tolerable good fortune, that Sir Harry, it is thought by some, intends to marry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Marry!—He should as soon marry the mummy of queen Semiramis.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>She has been strongly recommended to the family, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Recommended!—By whom!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>By one you are very intimate with, and who has very great influence with Sir Harry, as well as with yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ay!—Who is that?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me there, Sir Hornet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Certainly the fellow cannot be foolish enough to admire her—but I shall soon discover that, by what, he thinks of you—harkee, Harry!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>I cannot, upon the whole, tell very well what to make of you—Are you thoroughly convinced that you are, at this instant, legally capable of making your will?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>My will, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="57" facs="67"/>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ay—Are you of sound mind?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>I believe so, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Then pray tell me, now we have you face to face, what is your opinion of Miss Turnbull?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Sir!—That is by no means a question proper to be answered in this company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Pshaw!—Damn your delicacy—Make your panegyric, and I'll blush for her and you too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<stage>(Shrugs up his shoulders.)</stage>
<p>Sir, I have no panegyric to make.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Even so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why you impudent confounded—Have you the barefaced effrontery, with such a picture before your eyes, to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>You have applied the torture, and my own ease requires confession.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Humph—And so you—Now pray all be attentive, for Bacon's brazen head is going to utter—So you do not think Miss Turnbull a most engaging—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<stage>(Smiles.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why you intolerable—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am concerned to see you so serious on the subject—I must acknowledge, that in this case, Sir, I have either a most perverse or stupid imagination; and cannot, for the soul of me, discover the latent wonders in the young lady, which your better sight has so distinct a view of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am, however, exceedingly willing to try the utmost strength of my faith, to believe as much as I can, and take the rest for granted; provided you will not inflict the punishment of a wife upon my superstition.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="58" facs="68"/>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Obliging youth! <stage>(<hi>Bows</hi>)</stage>—inflict the punishment of a wife upon your superstition—And so you think, no doubt, a wife a burthen, much too heavy for the back of so fine and pretty a town-made gentleman as yourfelf.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>With the addition of Miss Turnbull's accomplishments, I most undoubtedly do, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>You do—humph—Pray, most civil Sir—permit me to ask—perhaps there may be some other lady, in this good company, to whom your profound penetration would give the preference.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>If such preference could, in the least make me deserving of her, I have no scruple to say there is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Miracle of modesty!—there is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Most assuredly—But, tho' to possess the lady you hint at, would make me blest beyond description, I have never dared to declare so much before, because I am conscious of being unworthy of such a prosusion of charms and accomplishments.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Generous diffidence!</p>
<stage>(<hi>aside.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Charms and—What the devil is all this!—Where am I—at sea, or on shore—Have I a calenture in my brain, or is this my nose!—They—they call you Sir Harry Portland, don't they Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>And your nephew, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir. <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>No—that's rather dubious—Well then, Mr. Harry, or Sir Harry, or what you please—You are pretty well convinced, I suppose, that I HAVE had some slight regard for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Perfectly, Sir, and remember it with gratitude.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>That remains to be proved, friend—Ever since your father's death, if I don't mistake, I have been tolerably busy, a little active,
<pb n="59" facs="69"/>or so, in forming your mind and manners, and moulding you into a sort of being, a man might behold without blushing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>It is impossible, Sir, I should ever forget your goodness, tho' I am happy to be reminded of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>That's a lie, I believe—However, Sir—among the rest of my cares, I was anxious to find a woman worthy of you—Nay, so solicitous was I about adjusting preliminaries, that tho' the gout had laid an embargo upon a parcel of my fingers and toes, I resolved to forego my own ease, and set sail immediately, that I might convoy you sase into the harbour of happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am very sensible of the benevolence of your intentions, Sir, and only wish you had done me the honour to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, I have only a word or two more to say on the subject—I have been an enthusiastic old blockhead, 'tis true, and was fool enough to think all men had eyes; however, if you have not either the complaisance, the wit, or the love, to hit upon some expedient to make your peace with Miss Turnbull, I will never see, never know, never speak to you again. And now, Sir, you will act as your great wisdom shall direct.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir, I am distressed to see you so intent upon this busines; I am exceedingly unhappy, to do the least thing to incur your displeasure—at this moment especially—I have a thousand reasons to be disatisfied with myself, and am grieved to add your anger to the lift—I would do any thing, in my power, to preserve your friendship and affection; but this is too severe a task—I cannot totally forget common sense—I cannot entirely command so delicate a passion, as that of love—A little time will discover,
<pb n="60" facs="70"/>whether I am ever to think of love or happiness again!—Of this, however, I am certain—I never can possess either with Miss Turnbull—</p>
</sp>

<p>It is one of the oddest adventures.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>How the deuce could you mistake that blowzabel, Miss Turnbull, for my turtle?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why true, as you say, friend Van: but that happens to be a blunder which I never did, nor ever could make. I should as soon take myself for a king, or you for a conjuror. I only mistook this lady to be Miss Turnbull, not Miss Turnbull to be this lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Mistook Miss Turnbull and this lady, and—I don't understand it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Be kind enough, Sir Hornet, to explain the matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>You remember, Madam, I had some conversation with you in the rooms at Bath.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Persectly—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="67" facs="77"/>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>And you could not but perceive how forcibly I was struck with your wit, beauty, and accomplishments.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>I recollect you were very polite, Sir, and were pleased to say abundance of obliging things.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Not half so many as I thought, I assure you, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Well said, Sir Hornet——My old friend is quite enamoured with you, turtle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, so I am—though I do not intend to marry the lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Hem!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>My grand object, the thing that, of all others, I have most at heart, is to see my nephew, Sir Harry, happy—As for myself, I feel I am growing old apace, and am almost tired of the farce of life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Why so, Sir Hornet? I am sure you play your part excellently.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>No, no—I am rolling down hill apace, and as the first steep declivity may precipitate me to the bottom, there are certain affairs I wish to see finished, one of which is the marriage of Sir Harry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>So the person you asked concerning me, when I went out of the rooms, mistook the question, and thought you meant Miss Turnbull?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>So it appears, madam—And I was too much enraptured to stay to rectify mistakes—when I negotiated the affair with 'Squire Turnbull, I studiously avoided an interview with his supposed sister, for fear the business should wear a face of precipitate indelicacy.—And I thought if I could once bring you and Sir Harry together, I would leave the contingent possibilities to love, and the superior good qualities and penetration of the parties,
<pb n="68" facs="78"/>which I, rationally enough, concluded could not fail to produce the desired effect.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>But, Sir Hornet, how did it happen that you did not enquire of me myself who I was?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why faith, madam, I had been so particular with you, and had spoken so freely on the subjects of love and matrimony, that I was afraid, if I made those kind of enquiries, you would mistake the matter, perhaps, and think I wanted to make love to you in my own proper person. Hey, young Van—</p>
<stage>(<hi>half aside.</hi>)</stage>

<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>

<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Hem!</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>

<p>I was at Mr. Osborne's when Sir Harry came—I was there with the mortgage of the Kentish estate.</p>

<p>Lost!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Timid.</speaker>
<p>Lackaday! that's not all—I went into the next room, and heard Sir Harry go to gaming, with a gang of sharpers that were there on purpose—Sir Harry had lost every thing he had in the world—Mr. Osborne has got all—All the mortgages of all his estates—I saw 'em—left 'em all in a box on his table.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Mortgages of all his estates! Perdition!—How did he get them?—How came you to know?</p>

<p>Thoughtless, weak man! Do you think the momentary pang of death a sufficient punishment for the ruin and distruction you have entailed upon all those who have had the misfortune to love, or to be related to you? Do you think that to DIE, and to forget at once your infamy and crimes, is a compensation for the havoc you have made with the peace and property of those who were dearest to you, who must LIVE to feel the effect of your vices, and bear, unjustly, the reproach of your abandoned conduct—</p>

<p>Oh torture!</p>

<p>Why so, Sir!—He has persisted in bringing destruction upon himself, and must suffer the effects of his obstinacy—What crime was there in my receiving what he was resolved to throw away. He had not been a month returned from his travels, before his passion for play made him the jest of every polite sharper in town—They saw there was an estate to be scrambled for, and every one was industrious to obtain a share—After squandering a part of his fortune among these adventurers, he engaged at play with me; and after losing one sum, was never easy till he had lost another—Am I then to be accountable for his folly?</p>

<p>In that box is contained all that I have ever won of you, and almost all you have ever lost—I have become and associate with sharpers to protect you from them, and by sacrificing a little, have preserved the rest.

<stage>(<hi>Goes to the chamber door and calls Melissa; Melissa enters, runs to Sir Harry, and falls upon his neck.</hi>)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>My brother!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Sister! Osborne!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Oh my heart!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<stage>(after a pause, and endeavouring to restrain his tears)</stage>
<p>Tol der rol.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Timid.</speaker>
<p>Lackaday!—I'm a happy old man!—He's a true friend!—he's a true friend!—I'm a happy old man!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Can you too, sister, forgive my folly? You that I have injured so unpardonably?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>Dear brother, you are not so guilty as you suppose—it was a plot upon you; you were
<pb n="76" facs="86"/>led into it, to shew you what a losing gamester is capable of?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Hark you, Sir? <stage>(to Osborne)</stage> All the mortgages and deeds are there, you say?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>All, Sir—together with whatever money else has, at any time, been won of him, since I have been concerned in this transaction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>All in that box?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>All.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Timid.</speaker>
<p>I'm a happy old man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>My dear uncle!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Let me alone—Tol der rol— <stage>(Goes up to Osborne, takes his hand, and wipes his own eyes)</stage> Will you forgive me, Osborne? Will you? Will you forgive my boy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<stage>(Takes Osborne's other hand)</stage>
<p>Osborne!—I cannot speak—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clare.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Osborne, I don't know how to tell you what I think—Esteem—admiration—veneration—are poor expressions to convey my feelings—I have been mistaken and to blame—I trembled for Sir Harry, I rashly condemned you, and wrote a letter—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Dear Madam, was that letter your's?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>It was.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>How much obliged am I to you, and to you all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>I am sorry, I was to blame.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Madam—Nobody was to blame—Angels are actuated by motives like your's, and if they never err, it is because they have commerce with angels only.—And now, dear Harry, suffer me to say one word—Let this transaction be a powerful, an everlasting memento to you.—Remember the blood that has been spilt in the moment of passion and distress, in consequence of indulging in this shocking vice—Remember
<pb n="77" facs="87"/>the distracted wife, and widow's curse, the orphans tears, the sting of desperation, and the red and impious hand of suicide; despise the folly that made the practice fashionable; oppose its destructive course, and for ever shun, for ever abominate, the detestable vice of gaming.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Professions of resolution, from me, Osborne, come with an ill grace—I am ashamed of my folly—I despis'd, even while I practised it; but the punishment you have inslicted, has been so judicious, so severely generous, I think I can safely say, there is no probability of a relapse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, but Harry, turn about—look at this lady—surely you have not forgot Miss Turnbull—have you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Your Miss Turnbull, Sir, I shall never forget.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh! what you have heard the renowned history of my Bath adventure?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>I have, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Well, and what say you to—hey my cherub—you told me, you know, you had no aversion to the fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir Hornet, is that the part of a confidante?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why, yes, it is—for, as I take it, a confidante is but a kind of a go-between to bring the parties together—And here comes the blooming youth— <stage>(<hi>Enter Vandervelt</hi>)</stage> here comes Johannes de Temporibus to second the motion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>To second what motion, Sir Hornet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>A hymeneal motion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Can't tell—who are the candidates?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="78" facs="88"/>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Harry Portland and Clara Forester.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Hold, hold, Sir Hornet, not so fast!—That lady is my ward.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Yes, and may, if she pleases, be your wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Nay—I—I did not say so, Sir Hornet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>No, but I did, young Van—but hark you— <stage>(<hi>takes him aside</hi>)</stage> Resign all your silly pretensions peaceably, throw your worthies into the fire, and give up the lady to her lover; or you shall be held up, in terrorem, an object of ridicule, to frighten all the dangling, whining, old fools in christendom, who are turned of threescore.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, speak in a lower key.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>May I be certain of your consent then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Why, yes—yes—heigho:—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Dear Madam—this worthy old Gentleman, your guardian, most humbly implores you would have pity upon Sir Harry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Did you say so, papa?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>Me! no—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
<p>N—not in those exact words, but something very like it, Turtle—heigho!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Melissa.</speaker>
<p>Come, my dear Clara—Let me have the happiness to call you sister—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Osborne.</speaker>
<p>Let me intercede, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw—here is every body interceding, but him that can intercede most to the purpose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Harry.</hi></speaker>
<p>Forgive me, dearest Clara—My fate is suspended on your lips, and I am so conscious of unworthiness, and so much affected by the fear of a severe sentence, that I have not power to plead for mercy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="79" facs="89"/>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Yes—but you have a partial, tender-hearted judge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ay—"and a wise young judge" too—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clara.</speaker>
<p>Well, well!—I cannot dissemble. A generous heart, a noble mind, are seldom met and seldom merited. When happiness like this presents itself, to reject is not to deserve it.</p>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by MISS YOUNGE.</byline>
<sp>
<l>INFORM me, you, at whom he seems to write,</l>
<l>Don't this man's insolence your spleen excite?</l>
<l>Give the beau-monde impertinent advice?</l>
<l>Proscribe VINGT UNE—prohibit box and dice!</l>
<l>Tell YOU of honour, infamy, undoing,</l>
<l>And—impudently preach you out of ruin?</l>
<l>Are cards and dice fit subjects for his fables?—</l>
<stage>(<hi>laughs</hi>)</stage>
<l>He'd better write a tragedy on E. O. tables?</l>
<l>And why, with so much rudeness and ill-nature,</l>
<l>'Gainst PRIVATE vice urge acrimonious satire,</l>
<l>Since legal lotteries flourish every year,</l>
<l>And peers and pedlars run the mad career</l>
<l>Of public ruin, in its full extent,</l>
<l>And beggars game—BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT!</l>
<l>Nay, once in seven years, in full perfection,</l>
<l>Is play'd a game more desp'rate, call'd, "ELECTION!"</l>
<l>When each grave senator the cause promotes,</l>
<l>And throws the main with—cogg'd and loaded votes;</l>
<l>When honour, conscience, justice, law, religion,</l>
<l>Are ev'ry one, by turns, the plunder'd pigeon!</l>
<l>But wherefore rail at games in any station?</l>
<l>Life is, itself, a game at calculation,</l>
<l>In which Dame Fortune gains but little thanks,</l>
<l>For each man swears HIS prizes are all blanks.</l>
<l>So when your am'rous lover draws for wife,</l>
<l>And wit and beauty link with him for life,</l>
<l>Tho' twice ten thousand vows of love were paid,</l>
<l>To gain the charming!—dear!—angelic maid!—</l>
<l>Tho' constancy and raptures were the theme!—</l>
<l>Let but possession chace the honey'd dream,</l>
<l>His bouncing passion bursts like bonfire squib,</l>
<l>And wit and beauty form—A CROOKED RIB!</l>
<l>The lordly husband takes a different tone,</l>
<l>When once sweet Miss becomes "bone of his bone!"</l>
<l>The tender epithet, the dying leer,</l>
<l>Are chang'd to—"Damme, Madam, can't you hear?"</l>
<l>For these, poor authors, who their pens employ</l>
<l>To write down pleasures which they can't enjoy,</l>
<l>You, against whom they aim their boldest strokes,</l>
<l>Have too much NONCHALANCE to mind their jokes;</l>
<l>You find them soporifics, quite composing,</l>
<l>For all the while they're preaching, you are dozing.</l>
<l>Our bard, who full of antiquated notions,</l>
<l>Intends to cure the world by scenic potions,</l>
<l>Gravely resolves to set the nation right,</l>
<l>If your applause should crown his hopes to night.</l>
