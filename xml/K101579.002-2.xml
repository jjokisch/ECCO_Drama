<p>THE SIEGE OF ALEPPO.</p>
<p>A TRAGEDY.</p>
</div1>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THE Reader will probably expect some Account of a Play which makes it's first Appearance in the World in this Manner.—He is to know then, that <hi>The Siege of ALEPPO</hi> having been refused by the Managers of both Theatres, to one of which, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> it was strongly recommended by Lady <hi>Caroline Burdet</hi> (who is thereby intitled to my present grateful Acknowlegements), would not have been offered to the Publick, had it not been honoured with the Approbation of several Persons of the first Note in the Republick of polite Literature, whom I am not at Liberty to mention.—I am obliged to declare this, in order to do common Justice to myself, and to obviate the Prejudices which might be conceived against a Performance that has not had the <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Advantage</hi> of a <hi>Theatrical Representation.</hi>—But the <hi>Play</hi> must now speak for itself; of which I shall say no more than just to premise, that the <hi>Fable,</hi> and whole <hi>Construction</hi> of it, excepting the <hi>Reality</hi> of the <hi>Siege,</hi> is purely <hi>fictitious:</hi> That the <hi>Incidents</hi> were <hi>designed</hi> to be <hi>natural,</hi> tho' <hi>unexpected,</hi> not arising from <hi>common-place</hi> Exigencies, or <hi>forced</hi> Expedients, (which is too frequently the Case) but from the <hi>predominant Principles</hi> of the <hi>Characters</hi> themselves: And that for this Purpose I have endeavoured to give a <hi>new,</hi> and something of an <hi>original</hi> Cast to the principal <hi>Characters,</hi> particularly to those of <hi>Theodore, Sophronius,</hi> and <hi>Ormelia.</hi></p>

<head>ACT I. SCENE I.</head>
<head><hi>SCENE</hi> <stage>a Piazza. After several Shouts of To Arms, To Arms, &amp;c. Enter <hi>SOPHRONIUS</hi> and <hi>LEON</hi> meeting.</stage></head>
<sp>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<l>SOPHRONIUS welcome! are our Messengers return'd from yonder Camp?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>Ev'n now, my Friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>I ask not the Success.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>Those Shouts may tell you:</l>
<l>Our Overtures of Peace were all receiv'd</l>
<l>With Scorn, and Pride peculiar to these Spoilers;</l>
<l>They know no Stile but that of Conquerours,</l>
<l>And in the Fullness of their Hearts declare,</l>
<l>The Faithful never take, but give Conditions.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Perhaps not yet—I pr'ythee, good <hi>Sophronius,</hi></l>
<l>What Terms do these victorious Vagrants offer?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="146" facs="147"/>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>First, they invite us to embrace their Faith,</l>
<l>And draw our Swords beneath the <hi>Prophets</hi> Banner,</l>
<l>No more their Foes, but Brethren of the War.</l>
<l>If wedded to our Errours, we reject</l>
<l>This friendly Proposition, (such they call it)</l>
<l>The next Alternative is briefly this,</l>
<l>That we confess the Prowess of their Arms,</l>
<l>By paying yearly Tribute to the <hi>Caliph.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>And it was this provok'd that glorious Uproar?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>The universal Voice is now for War:</l>
<l>Soon as th' impatient Rabble caught the News,</l>
<l>A Thousand Hearts were kindled in an Instant,</l>
<l>And in the Wildness of new Zeal, to Arms,</l>
<l>To Arms they cry'd, with such a clam'rous Shout</l>
<l>As tore th' Expanse of Heav'n, and sure must strike</l>
<l>Ev'n yon Barbarian Troops with sudden dread,</l>
<l>Though long inur'd to Terrours.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Thou hast warm'd me.</l>
<l>These martial Transports promise well, <hi>Sophronius;</hi></l>
<l>Perhaps the wrath divine that long has scourg'd</l>
<l>Our Follies, Vices, and corrupted Faith,</l>
<l>With iron Rod of War, at length relents,</l>
<l>Nor farther will permit this vile Imposture</l>
<l>To make its Way with Death, and Desolation;</l>
<l>And like a Deluge whelm the Eastern World.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>Alas, my Friend, we seem unfit for Mercy:</l>
<l>The seeds of Jealousy are sown among us,</l>
<l>And should they spread, and ripen to a Crop,</l>
<l><pb n="147" facs="148"/>
Yon greedy <hi>Mussulmen</hi> will reap the Harvest—</l>
<l>Our Passions, <hi>Leon,</hi> fight for <hi>Mahomet</hi>—</l>
<l>Union alone can save a sinking Land,</l>
<l>And Concord is the strongest Nerve of War.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Some distant Hints of this have reach'd mine Ear;</l>
<l>'Tis said, the baleful Breath of Whisperers</l>
<l>Has undermin'd the Worth of <hi>Theodore,</hi></l>
<l>And shook his Credit with your Father <hi>Manuel:</hi></l>
<l>Are these Suggestions true?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>Too true—My Father,</l>
<l>Whose Piety, and ev'n paternal Care,</l>
<l>Still anxious for the Welfare of his People,</l>
<l>Raises him high in all Affections,</l>
<l>Has yet the Leav'n of Old-Age within him:</l>
<l>(With Rev'rence let me speak in his Dispraise)</l>
<l><hi>Leon,</hi> that Sigh declares too well thou seest</l>
<l>His eager Warmth, his Frowardness of Temper</l>
<l>Impatient of Controul, and fixt as Death</l>
<l>In all Resolves—to this, Credulity</l>
<l>Too oft unlocks his Ear, and gives Access</l>
<l>To a well-garnish'd Tale.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Proceed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>Thou know'st,</l>
<l>Some Moons have shed their Beams since <hi>Theodore</hi></l>
<l>Lodg'd in our Town his hardy Band of <hi>Syrians,</hi></l>
<l>A voluntary Aid:—The <hi>Saracens</hi></l>
<l>Were then upon their March; and <hi>Manuel</hi> gave</l>
<l>The Honours of our chief Command to him.</l>
<l>Train'd from his active Youth a Son of War,</l>
<l><pb n="148" facs="149"/>
He is no nice Observer of the Forms,</l>
<l>The ceremonious Def'rence, and the Duties</l>
<l>Preeminence expects from all beneath her.</l>
<l>The desp'rate Fight that Yesterday he push'd,</l>
<l>Unauthoris'd by <hi>Manuel,</hi> some dark Foe</l>
<l>Has swell'd into a dang'rous Crime of State.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>It looks not well—the gallant <hi>Theodore,</hi></l>
<l>No Doubt, has noble Worth—sure, that Presumption</l>
<l>Was but th' Effect of Valour's Confidence—</l>
<l>Yet, I have lately noted, our <hi>Aleppians</hi></l>
<l>Like not the headstrong Fierceness of his Nature,</l>
<l>That wants more Tincture of Humanity:</l>
<l>Necessity, they say, unsheath'd the Sword,</l>
<l>But hot-brain'd <hi>Theodore</hi> enjoys their Dangers,</l>
<l>And revels savage in a Field of Blood.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>True—but a Breach might be pernicious now:—</l>
<l>And yet <hi>Sophronius</hi> has another Fear—</l>
<l><hi>Leon,</hi> how frail at best is mortal Man,</l>
<l>This Compound of Divinity and Passion?</l>
<l>For oh! believe me, midst this gen'ral Horrour,</l>
<l>While War with hideous Strides stalks round our Walls,</l>
<l>Legions of Evils gathering in his Train,</l>
<l>My Weakness robs my Country of my Thoughts,</l>
<l>And half my Breast admits a private Care.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Alas! I know that Care—You woo <hi>Ormelia,</hi></l>
<l>The Daughter of the valiant <hi>Theodore</hi>—</l>
<l>His other Joy, and what he loves next War.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>Ay, Friend, for should this Cloud of Discontent</l>
<l><pb n="149" facs="150"/>
Once gather to a Storm, will it not blast</l>
<l>Our growing Spring of Love? Love did I say?</l>
<l>'Tis true my secret Suit seem'd not ungrateful;</l>
<l>But know that glorious Maid adores her Father;</l>
<l>Nor marvel, she's the Daughter of his Soul;</l>
<l>His Spirit, Fierceness, and his Pride of Virtue,</l>
<l>All glow within her Breast, refin'd and cast</l>
<l>Into a softer Mould—Hence spring my Fears.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>There is Resemblance in our Lots, <hi>Sophronius;</hi></l>
<l>Thou know'st thy gentle Sister, fair <hi>Eusebia,</hi></l>
<l>Smiles on my honest Passion—Yet thy Father</l>
<l>Vows he will never sanctify her Choice—</l>
<l>'Tis true, my ruin'd Fortunes—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>Pr'ythee Peace;</l>
<l>Thy Birth is noble, and thy Virtue godlike;</l>
<l>These give thee ample Title to <hi>Eusebia:</hi></l>
<l>O could I call thee Brother—soothing Wish—</l>
<l>And yet thou'rt more already—Thou'rt my Friend. <stage>[Embrace.</stage></l>
<l>Wait we the Will supreme!—but see—my Sister.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Eusebia.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Eus.</speaker>
<l>Brother, the Chiefs are summon'd all to Council.</l>
<l>I heard Enquiry made for you, and <hi>Leon.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>I shall attend them—<hi>Leon,</hi> you will follow. <stage><hi>[Exit</hi> Sophronius.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Let me first pay more pleasing Duty here.</l>
<l>Why sighs my Fair? Our Hearts are sure our own:</l>
<l>Those <hi>Manuel</hi> cannot part—Oh! why that Tear?</l>
<l>I know it falls for <hi>Leon</hi>—cruel Fortune!</l>
<l><pb n="150" facs="151"/>
Why was I born to spoil <hi>Eusebia</hi>'s Peace?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eus.</speaker>
<l>I fear we have indulg'd our Loves too far—</l>
<l>As Children venture in a Calm to Sea,</l>
<l>Regardless of the Cloud slow-sweeping cross</l>
<l>The Vault of Heav'n, and big with future Ruin.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Yet let us not despair—Heav'n oft afflicts</l>
<l>For Trial, not Destruction—Time may come,</l>
<l>When my Heart's Truth, my Service in the War,</l>
<l>And all the virtuous Labours of a Life</l>
<l>Devoted to my Country, and to thee,</l>
<l>Will melt thy Father's Soul; then shall he bless</l>
<l>My Toils, and overpay me with thy Beauties.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eus.</speaker>
<l>Could he but view thee with <hi>Eusebia</hi>'s Eyes—</l>
<l>Yet something whispers me, we'ave done amiss;</l>
<l>Why was our Love first made a Mystery?</l>
<l>Why cover'd from the Day, and from my Father?</l>
<l>Who gave me right to fix my Heart on thee?</l>
<l>'Twas Folly, if not worse—and <hi>Manuel</hi>'s Anger</l>
<l>Perhaps is providential—for till now</l>
<l>His Fondness still prevented my Desires.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>That Fondness was but Humour—while he pleas'd</l>
<l>Thy tender Age, he but indulg'd himself;</l>
<l>Thou never hadst a Boon to ask till now—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eus.</speaker>
<l>Hah! <hi>Leon,</hi> have a Care; I love thy Virtue;—</l>
<l>That rais'd, and that must justify my Passion;</l>
<l>Urge not a Thought to shake my filial Duty—</l>
<l>I always held the Name of Father sacred.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>This Rigour, which I know not how to blame,</l>
<l><pb n="151" facs="152"/>
May crush the Hope that yet supports my Being:</l>
<l>I tremble while I speak—perhaps, thy Father</l>
<l>Means to compel thy Virgin Heart—if so—</l>
<l>Where will thy Duty be, or where thy Love?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eus.</speaker>
<l>Those Fears are vain—I cannot love another;</l>
<l>Virtue itself forbids it, and my Heart</l>
<l>Flutters, and tells me 'tis impossible.</l>
<l>My Vows are thine, (oh! spare a Maiden's Blushes)</l>
<l>My ev'ry Joy, my ev'ry Care is thine—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>O! how shall I requite this wond'rous Goodness?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eus.</speaker>
<l>Once more I will essay my Father's Temper—</l>
<l>If he relents—'tis all the Happiness</l>
<l>I wish on Earth—if not—support me Heav'n.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>He must, he must—or Pity's fled from Man:</l>
<l>Who could behold unmov'd such weeping Beauty?</l>
<l>Thou fairer than the Morning's cloudless Dawn,</l>
<l>Thou sweeter than the vernal Bloom that decks—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eus.</speaker>
<l>Away—I am a Woman, and a <hi>Christian;</hi></l>
<l>Cease then these Strains of ordinary Lovers,</l>
<l>That wound our Reason, while they sooth our Pride.</l>
<l>Nor suits thy Fondness with these Times of Danger;</l>
<l>Courtship and Dalliance are mere Treason now;</l>
<l>Thy Country calls thee—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>I obey the Call.</l>
<l>Yet Beauty is the just Reward of Valour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eus.</speaker>
<l>But should not be its Hindrance—</l>

<l>Let him divide the Post of Honour with me,</l>

<l>Be it so;</l>
<l>Yet hast thou prov'd this happy Day, <hi>Sophronius,</hi></l>
<l>That we can fight, and conquer too without him.</l>
<l>But Son, thy brave Fatigues demand Refreshment:</l>
<l>You and your Friends retire—I'll follow you.</l>

<l>Speak not thus harshly to me, lest I stand</l>
<l>A sad Exception to the gen'ral Joy:</l>
<l>Woman at best is weak—but when she loves—</l>

<l>My artless Passion, and O look with Pity</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Eus.</speaker>
<l>Your Pardon, Sir—</l>
<l>But oh! I cannot judge thus hardly of him.</l>
<l>Can there be Falshood in those Heart-fetch'd Sighs,</l>
<l>Those tender Pangs, and that Excess of Passion,</l>
<l>Which I, and all the Host of Heav'n have seen?</l>

<l>I'll hear no more—</l>

<l>Thou art my Daughter—let not thy Perverseness</l>
<l>Soil all the Blessings of this glorious Day—</l>

<l>Dost thou call this Obedience to a Father?</l>
<l>Away, and mark me, I desire Compliance</l>
<l>In Instances of greater Weight, or none.</l>

<l>This Resolution may undo me, Sir,</l>

<l>How! wilt thou teach me to reward my Soldiers?</l>
<l>But I perceive thy Stubbornness of Folly:</l>

<l>And therefore hear a Father's fixt Resolve;</l>
<l>Give me a Proof before To-morrow's Noon,</l>
<l><hi>Leon</hi> no more is Master of thy Heart,</l>
<l>Or quit my Roof, repair thee to a Convent,</l>
<l>And dedicate thy remnant Days to Heav'n.</l>
<l>So shall it sooth my Soul, when I reflect</l>

<l>To try his Depth of Malice—I assum'd</l>

<l>My Lord, he bears a most invet'rate Hate</l>
<l>To your high Virtue, which he terms your Pride—</l>

<l>My <hi>Sophronius,</hi></l>

I come for thee: For oh! without thy Presence—</l>
<l>Now my <hi>Eusebia</hi> has forsook the World,</l>
<l>Banish'd by fatal Love of wretched <hi>Leon,</hi></l>
<l>Though Mirth and Triumph raise their jocund Voice,</l>
<l>And the Roof echoes to the Sounds of Joy,</l>
<l>To me thy Father's House is desolate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Soph.</speaker>
<l>I will return with thee; and as we go,</l>
<l>Thou shalt be told my most uncommon Lot—</l>
<l>O could my Soul anticipate To-morrow—</l>
<l>But wear we calm Content upon our Brows,</l>
<l>And join the general Festivity—</l>
<l>In Love though both have been unhappy, <hi>Leon,</hi></l>
<l>We have a Refuge in our Friendship still—</l>
<l>Love is at best, my Friend, a virtuous Weakness;</l>
<l>The Appetite of Nature, not its Glory;</l>
<l>And ev'n the purest is alloy'd with Folly.</l>
<l>Friendship is wholly rational; the Ardour</l>
<l>Of gen'rous Minds, the Rapture of the Soul,</l>
<l>Preservative of Love, and its Survivor.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<l>Excellent Youth, my Sorrow's Remedy,</l>
<l>Methinks I catch the glorious Theme from thee.</l>
<l>Dear are the sacred Characters in Life</l>

<l>But the prime Gift that bounteous Heav'n can send,</l>
<l>Is the sure Blessing of a faithful Friend. <stage>[Exeunt.</stage></l>

<l>Now sudden he stopt short, and, sitting down,</l>
<l>Fast rivetted his Eye unto the Floor;</l>
<l>Then started up, and smote upon his Bosom;</l>
<l>Then spread his Arms to Heav'n, and with his Foot</l>
<l>Stampt hard, as tho' he meant to shake the Roof;</l>
<l>At length, with a deep Groan, that would have melted</l>
