<head>TO ANTHONY HENLEY, <abbr>Esq</abbr></head>
<opener><salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>THIS Play of <hi>Liberty Asserted,</hi> is by the right of Nature Yours, not only as You are a zealous Lover of Your Country, and a generous Assertor of Liberty, but as it owes its Birth and its very Being to You. For it was You, Sir, who gave the happy Hint upon which this Poem was form'd; from You from a Source of noble Sentiments it descended to Me, and 'tis from Me that with a just Ambition it ascends to You.</p>
<p>If I had had the Happiness to be nearer to You during the time that I was writing this Tragedy; if, as I at first receiv'd the Hint from You, I could have receiv'd Your Instructions about the Design and the Working of the Scenes, the Faults in this Poem had then been fewer; and the Present more worthy You. But I know that the Nobleness of Your English Principles will oblige You to excuse its Faults, on Consideration of the just Intention with the which it was writ; and that was no less than to do good to Your Country; to open the Eyes of deluded Men, to inspire them with the Love of Liberty, and unite and animate them against the Common Foe of <hi>Europe.</hi> But yet, if at last I did not flatter my self that this
<pb facs="6"/>
Play had many more Beauties than Faults, You should be the very last Person to whom I would chuse to address it. If You appear to be of the same Opinion, I have gain'd the chief Ends which I propose to my self in Writing, and that is to do a little Good, to distinguish my self by what I write, and by those to whom I address my self. I shall look upon Your Approbation as a glorious Earnest of Fame, for Truth will be sure at last to prevail; and that which we call Taste in Writing, is nothing but a fine Discernment of Truth. But as Truth must be always one, and always the same to all who have Eyes to discern it; he who pleases one of a true Taste at first, is sure of pleasing all the World at last. But I who have sometimes had the Honour to hear You talk of Criticism, have been a long time throughly convinc'd that from an Intimacy with the Ancients, and a just Knowledge of the Moderns, You have form'd that fine and admirable Taste, which is so rarely found among us. But I ought to consider that while I commend it, I may perhaps displease it, and ought in Discretion to say no more. I am,</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>AS the Entertainments of our Theatres are publick, and supported by publick Authority, it is but just that the Instruction, which is the ultimate end of them, should tend to the publick Advantage. 'Tis true, indeed, the Stage, by correcting particular Persons, has a natural tendency to the improving the Publick. But when, I say, that the Publick ought to receive Advantage from the Entertainments of our Theatres, I mean, that it ought to do so immediately, and that the Instructions which we receive from the Stage ought to be for the Benefit of the lawful establish'd Government.</p>
<p>That this was the Case among the <hi>Athenians</hi> appears plain to me; and the reason why they settled so vast a Fund upon the Tragick Stage, was because they regarded it as the very Barrier of Liberty, which it supported by exposing the Misfortunes of Tyrants, and the Calamities that attended upon Arbitrary Pow'r. And it seems to me to be for this reason that they had that high Esteem for <hi>Oedipus,</hi> and were at so uncommon an Expence in the Decoration of it, because both the Crimes and the Calamities of <hi>Oedipus</hi> were the Consequences of his assuming unlimited Pow'r. 'Tis true, he kill'd his Father before he came to be King, but it was by ascending the Throne that he committed Incest, and that he came to the knowledge of what he had done; and had he continued a private Man, he had neither known the Guilt of his Actions, nor had he felt the Punishment of them.</p>
<p>As the <hi>Athenians</hi> had Liberty with a Common-wealth, the <hi>English</hi> enjoy the very same Liberty under the Government of the best of Queens, and in so doing are the happiest People in the World. I thought therefore that I could not do a thing that would be more acceptable to all true Englishmen, than to cast in my Mite towards the defending and supporting of that Liberty.</p>
<p><pb facs="4"/>
That the Liberties of <hi>Europe,</hi> and of this Island particularly, are in no small Danger at present from the growing Power of <hi>France,</hi> will be easily granted by all but such who are either Fools or Knaves too incorrigible to be talk'd too. But this is plain, that they are not so much in danger, from what some call the Greatness of the <hi>French,</hi> as from the Baseness of the rest of <hi>Europe.</hi> If we were but as true to Liberty, as the <hi>French</hi> are to Tyranny, they would soon be as despicable in their Circumstances as they are now in their Principles. 'Tis the want of publick Spirit that ruins us, and the Design of this Tragedy is to inculcate that, this being its important Moral; that the want of publick Spirit in the Members of any Community makes not only the publick, but very often those private Persons who want it▪ very unhappy; that whoeven sells or betrays his Country either to a foreign Tyrant, as some of the Confederates, or to a home-bred one, as the whole Body of the <hi>French</hi> do; whoever does this upon the account of advancing his Family, which is the general Motive to such publick Treasons, is sure to have himself and his Family suffer with the rest, and perhaps with the foremost. And this Moral is prov'd by the Dramatick Action both ways. It shews a Man who makes a Treaty with the <hi>French</hi> upon private Interest, made by that Treaty the most wretched of Mankind, of the happiest that he was before; and it shews the very Frenchman who breaks it, about to be plung'd by the Breach of it, in the most deplorable Calamity; and it shews something farther too, that the <hi>French,</hi> who are the Instruments of promoting Tyranny upon a private Interest, are so only because they are so far blinded by their Passions, that they know not what they do; that is, they know not that they are sacrificing to their Tyrant their very Children and Families, for whose Support they pretend to act; that if their other Passions did not conccal this from them, all of them who have any thing of natural Affection, would be so far from being guilty of so unnatural a Villany, that they would immediately declare for Liberty.</p>
<p>Some People may perhaps admire, that I who have been accus'd of repeating the same thing in the Play, the Prologue and Epilogue, should yet appear to be farther guilty of that very Fault in the Preface. To whom I answer, That since after all the Care I had taken in the Play, the Prologue and Epilogue, to assure the World
<pb facs="7"/>
that this was an English and not a Party Play; there were some malicious enough to affirm that this was a Play writ purposely to oblige the Whigs, I thought it lay upon me to prove what I had affirm'd before, that this was not a Whig but an English Play, which I shall manifestly, I believe, make out, unless they will urge, that because it is an English therefore it is a Whiggish Play.</p>
<p>If this Play is writ for a Party, why then it must be writ against a Party. Now it will be pretty plain from what has been said above, considered with the Play it self, that the Design of this Tragedy is to make Men in Love with Liberty, by shewing them that nothing can be more according to Nature, and by shewing this not by such forcible and extraordinary Arguments as require more than ordinary Penetration to be understood, for that has been already done so incomparably by Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> that nothing need or can be added to it; but by something so plain that ev'ry Understanding is capable of it, and that is, by the most Tender of all Sentiments which Nature has implanted in the Minds of Men, and that is, the Love of their Children. The Party therefore that this Play was writ to oblige, are all those who have any concern for their Country, their Religion, their Relations, their Friends and their Children; and the Party it was writ against, are all those who care not one farthing for any or all of these. Now I would give a good deal to behold so abominable a Wretch as to own himself of such a Party.</p>
<p>He who writes for a Party writes for Interest; now I would fain ask any one where can be my Interest in writing for the Party for which it is supposed that I write. The first thing that I wrote which had relation to the Publick was a Poem call'd <hi>The Court of Death,</hi> in which I lamented the Death of the late Queen of happy and glorious Memory. And tho' both the Design and Spirit of that Poem were thought by some of the best Judges, to be above the common level of Poetry, yet I was almost the only Person of all the Writers who appear'd upon that Subject, of whom the Court took no notice. My Friends can bear me Witness that I was so far from being mortified at it, that I was resolv'd to persevere in what I thought my Duty, and of all the foresaid Writers I was afterwards
<pb facs="8"/>
the only Person who bewail'd the Death of the late King in the same publick manner that I had before lamented that of his Royal Consort. I had almost the same Fortune with that Poem that I had with the former: It brought me indeed a little more Reputation, but just as much Advantage.</p>
<p>He who after this could be induc'd to expect any thing from those whom they call the Whigs, must be of a more sanguine Temper than I am. I know indeed that there are a great many People whom they call Whigs, who are really Englishmen, and to oblige Englishmen I shall be always proud, by what Names soever they may be distinguished; By a real Englishman I mean one who is for the present Establishment, and the Protestant Succession, upon the view of the good of his Countrey, and his own no farther than as it depends on the other.</p>
<p>But upon the first acting this Tragedy there were not wanting some worthy Persons who made it their Business to report about the Town that it was a Republican Play. Now to give them an Answer to which nothing can be replyed, I have ordered the last Scene of the Play to be printed, which on the account of Length was left out in Acting, tho' it yet remains in the Play-house-copy. At the same time I desire the Reader to believe, that I am not such a Fool to contend for Names but for Things; that Liberty is Liberty under a limited Monarchy, as much as under a Common-wealth; that we enjoy enough under the present Queen to make us the happiest of People; that I have as high a Veneration for Her as any Subject She has, and would venture as much to serve Her, because I am perfectly convinc'd, that all that She aims at by Her perpetual Care and the Wisdom of Her Conduct, is to support and defend these Liberties which Her glorious Predecessour deliver'd to us; and which 'tis the Business of this Play to assert and vindicate. So that the Design of this Tragedy being only to promote the good Intentions of the Queen, it is more Her Interest than it is any Persons in <hi>England</hi> that it should make the Impression which it was design'd to make; tho' I believe it at the same time to be the Interest of ev'ry Person in <hi>England,</hi> excepting those who are wishing for a French Government or contriving to bring it in.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that since Her Majesties happy Accession
<pb facs="9"/>
to Her Throne I have endeavour'd to serve Her. And all the world knows that it is not my Fault that I have not done Her a most important Service. <note n="*" place="foot">Proposal for putting a speedy end to the War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> sold by Mrs. <hi>Baldwin.</hi></note> Had that been done, there had been no need of writing the following Tragedy. There had been no need of firing People with the Love of Liberty, or animating them against the common Foe. Had that been done the Liberties of <hi>Europe</hi> and our own had been sufficiently secur'd.</p>
<p>I know very well that the foregoing Declaration is not over politick; that to declare for the Publick against Parties is to make no Friends. I am perfectly convinc'd that if I could be brought to espouse any Party warmly, that Party might be brought to espouse me, but that till I make that step I must be left to my self; of this, I say, I am perfectly convinc'd, and yet notwithstanding that Conviction, I hope in God I shall not change my Conduct.</p>
<p>The Success of this Play has been so favourable notwithstanding Malice and ill Accidents; it has had the Felicity of having so many illustrious Voices for it, that I may spare my self the Trouble of answering Objections. However, since good Manners appear to be concern'd in two of them, I shall say a word to those.</p>
<p>The first is, that there are in this Play National Reflections, which ought not to be made. To which I answer, that I plainly perceive that the Art of the following Tragedy is by no means all understood. That part of it consists in this, that what some mistake for a National Satyr, is only a Satyr upon Arbitrary Power, a Satyr upon the Government of the French, and not upon their Manners as they proceed from their Climate. The French are in themselves a brave and a gallant Nation; but the Submission which they fondly pay to unlimited Power has plung'd them in Vices which their Natures abhor, and render'd them odious and despicable. To shew this, I have introduced the Characters of two Frenchmen, <hi>Frontenac</hi> and <hi>Miramont,</hi> who are both of them Men of Honour; but the difference between them is this, that <hi>Miramont,</hi> who declares against Arbitrary Pow'r, is altogether without Blemish, and the Faults and Defects in <hi>Frontenac</hi>'s Character, are plainly deriv'd
<pb facs="10"/>
from his Zeal for their present Government.</p>
<p>The other Objection is this, that the Satyr in the Ambassadors Scene is too course for delicate Ears. I know it very well, and in complaisance to some Gentlemen whom I esteem, I order'd it to be left out after the first Night, but I have printed it with the rest because they who do not like it may turn over it, and because it is likely to be subservient to the end for which this Poem was writ, and that is, to animate our <hi>English</hi> against the <hi>French</hi>; for I believe it may not be unacceptable to some honest downright Englishmen, who while we and the <hi>French</hi> are cutting one anothers Throats, will not take it ill, that we do it without Ceremony.</p>
<p>The Scene of this Tragedy lies at <hi>Agnie</hi> in <hi>Canada</hi>; which, for the sake of the better sound, I call <hi>Angie. Canada</hi> is a vast Tract of Land in <hi>Northern America,</hi> on the Back of <hi>New England</hi> and <hi>New York.</hi> As <hi>New England</hi> and <hi>New York,</hi> and the Country about them belong to the <hi>English,</hi> a considerable part of <hi>Canada</hi> is possess'd by the <hi>French</hi>; and as the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> divide the Country, they divide the Natives. The most considerable Nation of <hi>Canada,</hi> next to the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> are the <hi>Hurons,</hi> who are Friends to the <hi>French.</hi> But the five Warlike Nations of the <hi>Iroquois</hi> are our Confederates; of those five Nations, <hi>Agnies</hi> or <hi>Angies</hi> is one; and the chief Place of the Nation is <hi>Agnie</hi> or <hi>Angie,</hi> and thus much I thought fit to premise for the Sake of those who have never read either <hi>Hennepin</hi> or <hi>La Hontan.</hi></p>
<p>But now it will be convenient to say a word concerning the Scenes as they are mark'd in the printed Play, and here▪ by the word Scene, I do not mean so much the Place, as the Number of Persons who are in Action upon that Place at a time. I have therefore distinguish'd the Scenes in the following Play, as they have been always distinguish'd by the Ancients and by the Moderns of other Countries, and by our own <hi>Ben. Johnson.</hi> Any Person who comes upon the Place of Action, or leaves it, makes a different Scene, and that new Scene is mark'd by the Figure of its respective Number, and the Names of the Persons who are upon the Place of Action. I thought that agreeable Delusion into which the Reader willingly and gladly enters, for the sake of his Pleasure, would be both greater and easier if he were not put in mind
<pb facs="11"/>
of a Stage by <hi>Entrances</hi> and <hi>Exits,</hi> which are nothing but Direrections that are given to a Play House Prompter.</p>
<p>The Design of this Play was much improv'd by the Remonstrances which I receiv'd from my valued Friend Mr. <hi>Southern,</hi> who besides his Zeal to do good to his Friends, and a noble Sincerity, uncommon among the Writers of this Age, by the <hi>ex tempore</hi> Remarks which he made upon my reading this Play to him in a very hasty manner, shew'd at once so much penetrating Quickness, as well as so much Solidity, and so much sureness, as could belong to no Man but one who has a thorough Understanding of Nature, and who has that admirable Talent for touching the Passions which he has shewn in his Tragedies. I must own the Obligation too which I have to Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> for the Hints I received from him, as well as for his excellent Action.</p>
<p>This Play indeed receiv'd all the Grace and Ornament of Action in most of the principal Parts, and in all the Womens. But that of <hi>Sakia</hi> by Mrs. <hi>Barry</hi> was acted so admirably and inimitably, as that no Stage in <hi>Europe</hi> can boast of any thing that comes near to her Performance; or if the Foreign Stages can shew any thing like it, they are at least prodigiously improv'd since I was upon the Continent. That incomparable Actress changing like Nature which she represents, from Passion to Passion, from Extream to Extream, with piercing Force, and with easie Grace, changes the Hearts of all who see her with irresistible Pleasure.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoke by Mr. <hi>Betterton.</hi></stage>
<lg>
<l>THIS of deep Tragedies is sure the Age,</l>
<l>When <hi>Mars</hi> each day displays with swelling Rage</l>
<l>His bloody Scenes upon the Worlds great Stage.</l>
<l>Ye <hi>Brittons,</hi> from your <hi>Thames</hi>'s Silver Flood</l>
<l>Turn, turn your Eyes to Streams distain'd with Blood;</l>
<l>And to discover Scenes of mortal Woe,</l>
<l>Survey the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Danube</hi> and the <hi>Poe.</hi></l>
<l>No fancy'd Tragedies are acting there,</l>
<l>There the distracted Native rends his Hair,</l>
<l>And shrieks and wrings his Hands in true Despair.</l>
<l>While no vexatious Griefs to you are known,</l>
<l>But here you meet t'attend our pleasing moan,</l>
<l>And gently figh with Sorrow not your own.</l>
<l>By grateful Turns, with Fear and Pity seiz'd,</l>
<l>And when most terrify'd are then most pleas'd;</l>
<l>But Tragick Scenes may come where this Delight</l>
<l>Shall yield to Horrour and to mortal Fright:</l>
<l>When impious <hi>Mars</hi> shall with a dreadful Roar</l>
<l>Descend to visit pale <hi>Britannia</hi>'s Shore.</l>
<l>Already Treason whispers come away,</l>
<l>And clamorous Discord cries make no delay.</l>
<l>That Hour would shew a Tragedy indeed,</l>
<l>Whose sad Spectators would not weep but bleed.</l>
<l>Which to prevent all Patriots should contend,</l>
<l>These Scenes were wrought to serve so just an end;</l>
<l>To shew our inbred Foes ere 'tis too late</l>
<l>That they and theirs must share the common Fate.</l>
<l>For <hi>France</hi> its Blood exhausts, its Wealth expends</l>
<l>T'obtain its own and not our Plotters ends.</l>
<l>They who their Country for themselves enthrall,</l>
<l>Will see themselves and Children with it fall.</l>
<l>Would they reflect on this while yet they may</l>
<l>Themselves and Children they would ne'er betray,</l>
<l>As in the following Scenes we shew to Day.</l>
<l>For what Remains—</l>
<l>To please and to instruct we've done our best,</l>
<l>Then boldly let us make this just Request,</l>
<l>With silent care to the first Act attend,</l>
<l>Then you with Pleasure may perhaps unbend.</l>
</lg>
</div1>
<div1 type="epilogue">
<pb facs="13"/>
<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<lg>
<l>THus have we shewn what we propos'd to shew,</l>
<l>All would fall off from Tyrants did they know,</l>
<l>That with their wretched Country they betray</l>
<l>Themselves and Children to tyrannick Sway.</l>
<l>They who plac'd haughty <hi>Lewis</hi> on the Throne</l>
<l>Would have declar'd against Him, had they known</l>
<l>That their Soul's Darlings by his dire Commands</l>
<l>In Torments should expire by bloody Hands,</l>
<l>Or live a banish'd Race in Foreign Lands.</l>
<l>The fiercest Creatures that the Woods contain</l>
<l>What they bring forth with pleasing Love maintain.</l>
<l>That Love the Lyon softens, and the Bear,</l>
<l>The Worlds supported by that tender Care,</l>
<l>All Savages but Men their Offspring spare.</l>
<l>But Man, grown blind by Lust, of Pow'r or Pelf,</l>
<l>Will sell his Darling Offspring and himself.</l>
<l>To reclaim such our Author bad me say</l>
<l>He wrote this English and no Party Play:</l>
<l>He minds not who's of Whig or Tory Clan</l>
<l>But who for <hi>Lewis</hi> is, or who for <hi>ANN?</hi></l>
<l>For the same Friends have Lawless Rage and He,</l>
<l>As <hi>ANN</hi> has the same Foes with Liberty.</l>
<l>Oh may she long command these happy Isles!</l>
<l>Where she with Freedom Empire reconciles!</l>
<l>Long o'er your Hearts may yon bright Circle, Reign</l>
<l>Oh may you never feel a ruder Chain!</l>
<l>And of no other Tyranny complain!</l>
<l>But Beauties Reign on Liberty depends</l>
<l>When the French Reign begins, the Reign of Beauty ends,</l>
<l>The French are Slaves to Man's Despotick Sway,</l>
<l>But with Prophaness acted every Day</l>
<l>They force Celestial Beauty to obey.</l>

<l>Your lovely Son, th' auspicious <hi>Ulamar,</hi> </l>

<l>Is your Son's Triumph then become your Grief? </l>
<l>His Death had been your Joy then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Ah no! thou know'st I dote upon my <hi>Ulamar,</hi> </l>
<l>And when the Graces of his Mind and Person, </l>
<l>With Reason's Eye severely I survey, </l>
<l>Reason severely judging yet assures me, </l>
<l>That I have cause for all the Mother's Fondness: </l>

<l>His Death and Victory I fear'd alike.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>You utter Mysteries beyond my Reach.</l>

<l>Thou know'st my Son, that with the generous <hi>Beaufort</hi> </l>

<l>No Iroquois by Birth, no Native is of <hi>Angie.</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>I know you both indeed by Birth are Hurons.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Hurons we once were call'd, and once were thought </l>
<l>To be descended from no Vulgar Stock, </l>
<l>But now, alas! are sunk to wretched Slaves▪</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>To Slaves, <hi>Sakia!</hi> </l>
<l>Your Son at least has other Sentiments.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Howe'er alas, my Son may be deceiv'd, </l>
<l>I am a Slave, a miserable Slave; </l>
<l>Who far remov'd from my sweet Native Soil, </l>
<l>Far from the dearer Partner of my Heart, </l>
<l>Have for twelve tedious Years been now confin'd </l>
<l>To drag the galling Yoke of loathsome Life, </l>
<l>In this accursed Place: </l>
<l>A Burthen which I never could support, </l>
<l>But that I had some glimpse of Hope remaining; </l>
<l>That cruel Fortune might at length relent, </l>
<l>And might at length restore me with my <hi>Ulamar,</hi> </l>
<l>To the dear Partner of my faithful Heart: </l>
<l>Those Hopes have lately been reviv'd and animated </l>
<l>By the prophetick Visions of the Night,</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="17"/>
And Expectation of this fatal Action; </l>
<l>But this Relation has o'erthrown them all: </l>
<l>My Son's mistaken Valour has undone us, </l>
<l>And thou, O <hi>Miramont,</hi> art lost for ever!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>Forget your Hurons and become an Angian.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>O may the whole accursed Race by Fate </l>
<l>Be rooted ev'n from Human Memory! </l>
<l>Perish their very Names too with their Persons, </l>
<l>Excepting thine, for thou art wondrous good.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l><hi>Sakia,</hi> you forget, </l>
<l>To curse your Benefactors thus is impious.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>To curse our mortal Enemies is just.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>The Angians are your Friends and your Defenders.</l>

<l>My Country's mortal Enemies are mine.</l>

<l><hi>Iroquian Angie</hi> is your Country now.</l>

<l>My Prison never can be call'd my Country.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>The Angians gave you Liberty at first; </l>
<l>The Hour that made you Captives, saw you free.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Why am I then with my unhappy Son </l>
<l>Detain'd e'er since in this detested Clime, </l>
<l>Enjoying nothing but the Name of Liberty, </l>
<l>Which hourly brings the thing to my Remembrance, </l>
<l>And makes the Yoke of Slav'ry wring me more? </l>
<l>Know that I'm not deluded by a Word, </l>
<l>And ev'n this Shadow of the Angians Favour </l>
<l>Is due to the Request of generous <hi>Beaufort</hi>; </l>
<l>For he the fatal Expedition led, </l>
<l>To which I owe this long Captivity, </l>
<l>To which I owe a twelve Years mortal Woe </l>
<l>Confin'd by barbarous Iroquois to <hi>Angie</hi>; </l>
<l>Which may just Heav'n by sharpest Plagues revenge!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>You curse the Victors, Heav'n has curst the vanquish'd.</l>

<l>Therefore the barbarous Iroquois I curse.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Think on the Trophies by his Valour won, </l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>'Tis to our Favour that he owes his Glory, </l>
<l>Which, tho' he scarce has reach'd his twentieth Year, </l>
<l>Surpasses that of all our ancient Warriours.</l>

<l>'Tis by his Glory you exist, but he </l>

<sp>

<l>Leading our Forces he acquir'd his Fame.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Yes, against the Hurons, </l>
<l>Our Obligations there indeed are great, </l>
<l>For causing him to turn his fatal Sword </l>
<l>Upon the bleeding Bowels of his Country, </l>
<l>And its Confederate Friends the Warlike French; </l>
<l>Who for strong Reasons ought to be most dear to him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>Poorly your partial Mind affects the French, </l>
<l>While he detests the false perfidious Race, </l>
<l>And threatens to extirpate all those gay, </l>

<l>Which lately crept usurping thro' the Corn, </l>
<l>T'oppress the genuine and the noble Seed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Tho know'st him not, he's ignorant of himself, </l>
<l>And both are blind alike; but one Day Fate </l>
<l>Will dissipate th' impenetrable Cloud </l>
<l>That now obscures his Sight, and then too late </l>
<l>His fond and fatal Error he'll detest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>But why! </l>
<l>For he who does his Duty, first must know it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>But this he knows at present that the French </l>
<l>Are strictly to his Countrymen ally'd,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>He owns no Country but Iroquian <hi>Angie,</hi> </l>
<l>Who to the French must prove eternal Foes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Time will instruct him better.</l>
</sp>

<l>Yes, for our <hi>Angie</hi> will become to morrow </l>
<l>His Country by a stricter dearer tie.</l>

<l>What meanest thou?</l>

<l>Explain thy self.</l>
</sp>

<pb n="5" facs="19"/>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>To morrow's Sun, will see that Beauty his, </l>
<l>For whom the loveliest of our Indian Swains </l>
<l>Have sigh'd and sigh'd in vain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Thou mean'st the blooming Daughter of <hi>Zephario,</hi> </l>
<l>Head of th' Iroquian Tribes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>Who can be meant but blest <hi>Irene,</hi> whom </l>
<l>Divided <hi>Canada</hi> consents to adore, </l>
<l>And they who come from distant Climes admire? </l>
<l>The Adoration of two Worlds, the English, </l>
<l>To whom uncommon Beauty is familiar, </l>
<l>Astonish'd gaze at her amazing Form, </l>
<l>As at a Wonder never seen before.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Yes, the brave <hi>Beaufort</hi> too admires <hi>Irene,</hi> </l>
<l>And to her lays an equal Claim with <hi>Ulamar</hi>; </l>
<l>And for that Reason thou art wrong inform'd, </l>
<l>For <hi>Angie</hi> dares not disoblige the English.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>But when the rival Friends went out to Battel, </l>
<l>Thus said the wise <hi>Zephario,</hi> </l>
<l>Ye matchless Friends, thou <hi>Beaufort</hi> and thou <hi>Ulamar,</hi> </l>
<l>Ye great and fair Supports of Liberty, </l>
<l>And <hi>Canada</hi> against a faithless Race, </l>
<l>Who have perfidiously surpriz'd our Angians, </l>
<l>And in full Peace with Sword and Fire attack'd them; </l>
<l>Lead forth our Arms against the perjur'd Foe, </l>
<l>And know that he who for the common Cause, </l>
<l>Against that Foe performs the noblest Deeds, </l>
<l>At his return shall call <hi>Irene</hi> his. </l>
<l>The Father said, the charming Daughter blush'd, </l>
<l>And to the just Decree the Friends consented.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>My <hi>Ulamar</hi> is not return'd from fight, </l>
<l>How can that Diff'rence be determin'd then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>By the Relation of impartial <hi>Beaufort,</hi> </l>
<l>By which he owns that your unequall'd Son, </l>
<l>By his wise Conduct and his brave Example, </l>
<l>Sav'd both his English and our Iroquois.</l>
</sp>

<l>That was the Modesty of generous <hi>Beaufort,</hi> </l>
<l>But when he own'd this was <hi>Irene</hi> present?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>Yes, and in spight of all her shy Demureness,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>Come, she is worthy of the first of Men.</l>
</sp>

<l>'Tis true, so fair a Creature I ne'er saw. </l>
<l>Ev'n I, whom pow'rful Reasons force to hate her, </l>
<l>Ev'n I with Pleasure gaze upon her Face, </l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>To both you're cruel.</l>

<l>No, for if once their Hands are join'd he's lost, </l>

<l>Well, you have conquer'd then.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Yes; impartial Heav'n has heard our just Appeal, </l>

<l>'Tis a shrewd Sign their Valour they mistrust,</l>
<l><pb n="7" facs="21"/>
Who still on Treason or on Odds depend. </l>
<l>But against Odds and Treasons both we conquer'd, </l>
<l>Such Force deriv'd we from the just Disdain </l>
<l>That Honour, Innocence, and heavenly Truth, </l>
<l>Should yield to Falshood, and to Hell-born Crimes, </l>
<l>That Thought alone sustain'd our sinking Troops, </l>
<l>That Thought inflam'd them in extreme Distress, </l>

<l>Not the last Trumpet that must rowse the dead, </l>
<l>To them more sudden Vigour shall convey, </l>
<l>Than did to ours that animating Voice, </l>
<l>All thought that Heav'n declar'd it self aloud, </l>
<l>Strange Sights were seen, and wondrous Sounds were heard, </l>
<l>'Tis said a Flame descended upon <hi>Ulamar,</hi> </l>

<l>Rows'd all our Vigour in our fainting Troops, </l>

<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l><hi>Beaufort,</hi> thou art too partial to thy Friend.</l>

<sp>

<l>The greatest Friendship you can shew my Son </l>

<l>On that of Gratitude. </l>

<l>Remind him of his Obligations.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beauf.</speaker>
<l>What Obligations?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>He well remembers them tho' you forget, </l>
<l>Too generous <hi>Beaufort.</hi> </l>
<l>Who snatch'd the Dagger from his Infant Breast, </l>
<l>In that accursed Hour that made us Captives? </l>
<l>When only we of all the Slaves were sav'd. </l>
<l>Who forc'd the Iroquois to give us Liberty, </l>
<l>At least a shew of Liberty? </l>
<l>Who since instructed him in glorious Arms? </l>
<l>Instructed him in European Arts? </l>
<l>To whose dear Friendship is his Glory owing, </l>
<l>His noble Acts, and his accomplish'd Greatness? </l>
<l>Tell him aloud he owes all this to <hi>Beaufort.</hi></l>

<pb n="9" facs="23"/>
<speaker>Beauf.</speaker>
<l>Why should I tell him this?</l>

<l>To urge him, </l>
<l>By the remembrance of these mighty Benefits, </l>
<l>To quit his fond Pretensions to <hi>Irene,</hi> </l>
<l>And not impeach his Happiness, to whom, </l>
<l>Whate'er he has, whate'r he is he owes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beauf.</speaker>
<l>He owes his Greatness to himself alone, </l>
<l>And carries an Instructor in his Breast, </l>
<l>Beyond what all the World can e'er supply; </l>
<l>For <hi>Ulamar</hi> seems sent express from Heav'n. </l>
<l>To civilize this rugged Indian Clime; </l>
<l>But grant to me alone he ow'd his Greatness, </l>
<l>How base, how barb'rous would it be to upbraid him? </l>
<l>Besides all this, how vain? for know your Sons </l>
<l>No vulgar Passion is that force acquires, </l>
<l>By just Degrees, and kindles into Flame; </l>
<l>His the first moment blasted him, like Lightning </l>
<l>That falls from Heav'n when <hi>Jove</hi> with his own Fire, </l>
<l>That Tree that's sacred to himself consumes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>I but too well remember it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beauf.</speaker>
<l>Immediately he had recourse to me, </l>
<l>Who saw, and therefore lov'd <hi>Irene</hi> first; </l>
<l>Then Sorrow streaming from his humid Eyes, </l>
<l>That sparkled with Desire, my Friend, says he, </l>
<l>I come to take my leave, for I must die, </l>
<l>Since only Death can make me just to <hi>Beaufort</hi>; </l>
<l>For only his cold Hand can quench the Flame </l>
<l>That is injurious to my Friend, to whom </l>
<l>The best of Mothers and my self I owe, </l>
<l>And then I love, said he, with faltring Tongue, </l>
<l>And with a Heart about to break with Grief, </l>
<l>I love <hi>Irene,</hi> and for <hi>Beaufort</hi> die.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>And how receiv'd you this?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Beauf</speaker>
<l>With some Surprise, but yet with firm Resolve, </l>

<l>This proffer'd Peace shall be refus'd with Scorn, </l>

<l>They proffer Peace! </l>

<l>Ah! <hi>Okima!</hi> I sink, I die with Grief, </l>
<l>On this Important now depends my all; </l>

<l>Come, you provoke th' indulgent Powers to leave you, </l>

<l>Once more thou know'st him not, nor he himself, </l>

<l>From all the World I've kept th' important Mystery. </l>

<l>But first by that eternal Spirit swear, </l>

<l>To let no Time, nor Art, nor Force </l>
<l>Extort it from thy Mind.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>By that eternal conscious Pow'r I swear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Know then my Son, who thinks himself a Huron, </l>
<l>And whom too thou believ'st of Indian Birth, </l>
<l>No Huron is, nor of Canadian Kind; </l>
<l>Know he descended of a Christian Sire, </l>
<l>Young, valiant, beautiful, of noble Race.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>A Christian! you amaze me! of what Nation?</l>
</sp>

<l>Consult my Passions, and let those inform thee.</l>

<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>What say'st thou? Then by Nation he is French.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>French is his Nation, <hi>Miramont</hi> his Name.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>Why is this Secret from your Son conceal'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Let Time and Fate reveal it to him.</l>

<l>I dare not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>What should deter you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Know that my Guardian Spirit in my Dreams </l>
<l>Has more than once with fearful Threats forbid me. </l>
<l>Besides, th' important Secret should I tell, </l>
<l>Before my Son has seen and known his Father, </l>
<l>So deadly is his Hatred to the French, </l>
<l>The which, together with his Years grew up, </l>
<l>It might a criminal Aversion cause </l>
<l>To him who gave him Being; and besides, </l>
<l>All hopes of Peace it surely would destroy: </l>
<l>For that upon his Sentiment depends, </l>
<l>But he who <hi>Angie</hi> to the World prefers, </l>
<l>Will do his utmost to obstruct a Peace, </l>
<l>That needs must tear him from this cursed Clime. </l>
<l>He'll know that Peace will soon divnlge his Birth, </l>
<l>And knows the Angians never will endure </l>
<l>To have a Frenchman lead their Troops to Battel. </l>
<l>Besides, should <hi>Ulamar</hi> this Secret hear </l>
<l>Before he sees and knows his noble Father, </l>
<l>It might produce an impious Thought of me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>This is but one of those fantastick Fears </l>
<l>To which long Melancholly makes you subject; </l>
<l>For why should it produce that impious Thought?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>In secret <hi>Miramont</hi> and I were match'd, </l>
<l>And thrice three Years in Bonds clandestine liv'd; </l>
<l>In secret too I brought forth <hi>Ulamar</hi>; </l>
<l>And for three Years in private was he nurst, </l>
<l>And five I bred him with me as my Slave, </l>
<l>By <hi>Miramont</hi> presented to my Father, </l>
<l>And then your Angians made us real Captives. </l>
<l>When first my Husband's Hands and mine were join'd, </l>
<l>No Soul was conscious to my plighted Troth, </l>
<l>But Heav'n, and <hi>Miramont,</hi> and the poor Priest.</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="27"/>
That kindly tied th' indissoluble Bond. </l>
<l>Should <hi>Miramont,</hi> avert it Heav'n, be gone </l>
<l>To that strange Land where Souls departed dwell, </l>
<l>What Thoughts might such a Tale produce in <hi>Ulamar?</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>The Priest who join'd you might attest your Marriage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Long since, alas! that faithful Friend is dead.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>But why that tedious nine Years Mystery?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Know that my <hi>Miramont,</hi> of noble Race, </l>
<l>Was yet a younger Brother of his House, </l>
<l>And therefore he depended on his King, </l>
<l>Now with that King those haughty Priests have Pow'r, </l>
<l>Who stile themselves Companions of their God, </l>
<l>And they, unless I would embrace their Faith, </l>
<l>Forbad all Nuptial League 'twixt me and <hi>Miramont,</hi> </l>
<l>Upon the penance of his King's Displeasure.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>When you were taken where was <hi>Miramont?</hi></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>He then was in a distant Fort besieg'd, </l>
<l>Which for his Monarch bravely he maintain'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>Have you ne'er since had Tidings of him;</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Ah! there thou prob'st me to the very Heart, </l>
<l>I since have never, never heard of him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>Perhaps by Fortune of that War he fell.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Should I believe thee my sad Heart would break, </l>
<l>And I, dear <hi>Miramont,</hi> once more should join thee; </l>
<l>But the great Mind is merciful and good, </l>
<l>And may have Comfort yet for poor <hi>Sakia.</hi> </l>
<l>That I from <hi>Miramont</hi> have never heard, </l>
<l>Proceeds from the vast Tract of Land between us, </l>
<l>Or want of Commerce 'twixt the French and you, </l>
<l>Or from th' unusual Names your Nation gave us, </l>
<l>When first they brought us mourful Slaves to <hi>Angie</hi>; </l>
<l>For I whom th' <hi>Angians</hi> now <hi>Sakia</hi> call, </l>
<l><hi>Nikaia</hi> was thro' all th' Huronian Land, </l>
<l>And <hi>Ulamar</hi> young <hi>Miramont</hi> was there.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>But should he live, you three can never meet, </l>
<l>For as this Secret to the World divulg'd, </l>
<l>Ruins your Son with these five Warlike Nations; </l>
<l>So 'twill disgrace your Husband with the French,</l>

Their Priests offended would incense their King.</l>

<l>My <hi>Okima,</hi> know things are alter'd much▪ </l>
<l>For by long Conferences here with <hi>Beaufort,</hi> </l>
<l>My Son and I both strongly are inclin'd </l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>Ye Pow'rs! who ever in so short a time </l>
<l>Display'd such various Wonders? </l>
<l>Yet <hi>Miramont</hi> by strong Presumptions dead, </l>
<l>And 'tis your Safety to promote this Match.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sab.</speaker>
<l>What! with my Husband's mortal Enemies?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Okim.</speaker>
<l>The dead have none, Death reconciles us all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>But know that once </l>
<l>My <hi>Miramont,</hi> when in a dangerous State, </l>
<l>Upon the Bed of Languishment he lay, </l>
<l>Caus'd me to swear by all that I rever'd, </l>
<l>Even by the sacred Bond that join'd our Hands, </l>
<l>By Love, the sacred Tie that join'd our Souls, </l>
<l>And by the bright eternal Source of Love; </l>
<l>That when my <hi>Ulamar</hi> arriv'd to Manhood, </l>
<l>I ne'er would wed him to an Indian Maid; </l>
<l>But would transport him to those happy Climes, </l>
<l>That th' Ocean from our <hi>Canada</hi> divides. </l>
<l>Besides, in the dread Visions of the Night, </l>
<l>I now for three successive Nights have seen </l>
<l><hi>Miramont</hi> threatning with a dreadful Frown </l>
<l><hi>Irene,</hi> and the Love-sick <hi>Ulamar.</hi> </l>
<l>These Dreams are to my Son of dire Presage, </l>

<l>And I behold thee here in spight of both, </l>
<l>All dismal with the pretious Blood of Hurons </l>
<l>And their Allies, Heav'n knows, alas, whose Blood! </l>
<l>Why would'st thou thus against my softest Pray'rs, </l>

<l>The tender Bowels of the Wretch that bore thee?</l>

<l>No, but I know that I am an Angian now, </l>

<l>O Weakness to be pitied or despis'd!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ulam.</speaker>
<l>For ever blest be that eternal Pow'r </l>
<l>That gave me a human comprehensive Soul, </l>
<l>That can look down upon all narrow Principles. </l>
<l>For every brave Man's Country is the Universe, </l>
<l>His Countrymen Mankind, but chiefly those </l>
<l>Who wish the Happiness of all the rest, </l>
<l>And who are Friends to all their Fellow Creatures: </l>
<l>And such are all the brave Iroquian Tribes, </l>
<l>Such are th' unconquer'd English, free themselves, </l>
<l>And loving all who actually are free, </l>
<l>And all who sadly sigh for Liberty; </l>
<l>But hating Tyrants and their Slaves alike, </l>
<l>And equally contemning both as fall'n </l>
<l>Below the Dignity of Human Nature.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Tyrants are odious, Slaves are to be pitied, </l>
<l>Our own sad Fate has told us so.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ulam.</speaker>
<l>To me all Slaves are odious as their Tyrants, </l>
<l>I mean all Slaves who are the Tools of Tyrants, </l>
<l>They are true Slaves, who have the Souls of Slaves, </l>
<l>And worse than Beasts make use of their own Hands, </l>
<l>To clinch the Chains which first their Masters tied. </l>
<l>Such tame and wretched things are all your Hurons, </l>
<l>No Countrymen for me who here disown them, </l>
<l>Such are those Pests of Human Race the French, </l>
<l>Damn'd to eternal Slavery themselves, </l>
<l>And therefore would like Devils damn Mankind.</l>

<l>The Hurons thou disown'st, disown them still, </l>
<l>But know amongst them are thy dear Relations, </l>
<l>Whom God and Nature charges thee to cherish: </l>
<l>How canst thou tell that in the late fought Field </l>
<l>Thou didst not meet thy Father in thy Foe? </l>
<l>Yes, how canst thou be sure thou didst not lift</l>

<l>When e'er I cease to hearken to the Dictates </l>
<l>Of the World's Ruler and his Servant Nature, </l>
<l>I shall deserve to be a thing accurst; </l>
<l>In the late Fight that I might spare my Kindred, </l>
<l>I shun'd your Hurons and attack'd the French, </l>
<l>And urging thro' their troops my glorious Way, </l>
<l>I made a slaughter of their bravest Chiefs, </l>
<l>Which they will long with bitter Woe remember.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sak.</speaker>
<l>Ha! have a care! thou sayest Mankind's thy Kindred, </l>
<l>Among the French too thou might'st find Relations.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>Ulam.</speaker>
<l>'Tis true we were created Brothers all, </l>
<l>And all descend from one eternal Sire; </l>
<l>But whom the Father for his Sons disowns, </l>
<l>I owe not for my Brethren; no, the Brave </l>

<l>When first in the late Fight with my good Sword, </l>
<l>I carried Death among the Faithless French; </l>
<l>One of their foremost Leaders I observ'd, </l>
<l>Who mow'd our Iroquois like ripen'd Corn, </l>
<l>Extending them in Ranks along the Plain; </l>
<l>With him went all his Souldiers Hearts and Eyes; </l>

<l>So great, so awful and so truly noble, </l>

<l>COme, be not guilty of thy own Destruction! </l>
<l>Believe it, I would gladly be thy Friend; </l>
<l>Besides that, I respect thy wondrous Virtue; </l>
<l>There's something so engaging in thy Person, </l>

<l>Assist us to subdue these Warlike Nations; </l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ula.</speaker>
<l>What right have I to rule these Warlike Nations▪</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Front.</speaker>
<l>The Justest in the World, the right of Nature: </l>
<l>Thou singly hast more Virtue than them all; </l>
<l>And therefore art by Nature form'd to rule them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ul.</speaker>
<l>With bare Desert a generous mind is satisfy'd; </l>
<l>If I have Virtue give me leave to keep it? </l>
<l>Complying with thy offer would destroy it, </l>
<l>And I should then have more and blacker Crimes </l>
<l>Than all the warlike <hi>Iroquois</hi> together; </l>
<l>But thou mistak'st thy Man, I have a Soul </l>
<l>That scorns a Tyrant, and a Slave alike; </l>
<l>And thou would'st have me both: </l>
<l>But since thy offer kindly is design'd; </l>
<l>Ingratitude I doubly will return it.</l>
</sp>

<l>Return it, say'st thou? How?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Set me but free, and I'll in kind return it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>In kind?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ul.</speaker>
<l>Yes, Rouze thy self, and shake off this vile Yoak, </l>
<l>Under the which thou bow'st thy Neck and groan'st: </l>
<l>I'll make thee King of all <hi>Canadian France,</hi> </l>

<l>Yet be advis'd and Live.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ul.</speaker>
<l>Not on thy terms, I'm not of Life so fond; </l>
<l>Weigh both our offers, and judge which is Juster; </l>
<l>Tyrant and Slave at once thoud'st have me turn, </l>
<l>And weaken and debase my freeborn mind; </l>
<l>That's independant now of all but Heav'n; </l>
<l>And a Superiour in a Man disdains; </l>
<l>The greatest, best of Men are but my equals: </l>

<l>I would Establish thee a Lawful King, </l>
<l>And o'er a happy People shalt thou Reign, </l>
<l>Would break thy ignoble Bonds, and give thee means </l>
<l>T' assert thy Liberty, t' assert thy Virtue; </l>
<l>For lurking in thy breast I see the Seeds </l>
<l>Of ev'ry noble Virtue; but by custom </l>
<l>And vain opinion choak'd, and blind obedience </l>
<l>To the unjust ambition of thy Master. </l>
<l>As thou art Man, thou art Generous and Brave, </l>
<l>True Maganimity adorns thy mind, </l>
<l>And thou art as Dearly awful to my Soul </l>
<l>As if thou wert my Father. </l>
<l>But as thou art French, thou art Base, Perfidious, Perjur'd, </l>

<l>Should I comply with thee, and should undo </l>
<l>These Generous Nations, who are happy now </l>
<l>In Innocence and Freedom; but would then </l>
<l>Be plung'd in Vice and endless Misery; </l>
<l>How when I afterwards met woful sights,</l>

Deplorable misfortunes, melting Objects; </l>

<l>The noblest Talents of thy mind and Person, </l>
<l>Thy Wisdom, and thy Courage hast employ'd </l>
<l>To cast all other Nations into Chains, </l>
<l>And Clinch, and Rivet those that bind thy own, </l>
<l>Who hast been Industrous to entail Destruction </l>
<l>Upon the Race of Men, to all Posterity, </l>

<l>O would'st thy Rouze thy self, and break thy Chain </l>
<l>How would thy Virtue, and thy Glory Shine! </l>
<l>And to what Height thy Happiness would Soar! </l>
<l>Then Impious War should here for ever cease </l>
<l>Which never came among these Happy Groves, </l>
<l>'Till thy false Race, first Landed on our Shoar. </l>
<l>For 'tis for Liberty we War, not Empire; </l>
<l>While at the Blood we spill we hourly sigh, </l>
<l>And Curse the Falshood of detested Slaves, </l>
<l>That rudely force us to Destroy our kind. </l>
<l>How shameful 'tis, that Men whom Heav'n has form'd </l>
<l>Of this vast Universe; the fellow Citizens </l>
<l>Should thus wage Civil and unnatural War: </l>
<l>All Creatures that have Life, but Men agree; </l>

<l>That makes the Forest tremble at his Roar,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Mir.</speaker>
<l>Yes, yes, Brave Youth, we have Children, nay and Wive's, </l>
<l>But shamefully have been afraid to own them, </l>
<l>For fear our mighty Monarch should grow Angry, </l>
<l>And that Vile fear has lost them; if they Live, </l>
<l>They languish in a rude Captivity; </l>
<l>And to retrieve them, and to keep them ours, </l>
<l>We have no hope, but by thy Generous offer. </l>
<l>Come rouze my Lord, how long shall we have Patience: </l>
<l>Have Patience! have Stupidity I would say! </l>
<l>For Patience is a Virtue, this a Vileness, </l>
<l>A very want of Spirits in our Blood: </l>
<l>Come▪ how much longer shall we crouch and Fawn, </l>
<l>Yes Fawn like Dogs, the more, the more we're scourg'd: </l>
<l>But Dogs when Beaten only Fawn on Men</l>
<l><pb n="57" facs="71"/>
Who were to them Superiour Creatures form'd: </l>
<l>No Dog will fawn upon a Dog who tears him: </l>
<l>Yes, 'tis a sign we have Sacrific'd our Virtue, </l>
<l>Nay, and our very Reason with our Virtue, </l>
<l>When we can thus resolve to offer up </l>
<l>Our Children to the Rage of Lawless Sway. </l>
<l>What is he? That he proudly thus commands us, </l>
<l>Not only to commit the basest Crimes, </l>
<l>To grow the scourge of God, and be the plagues </l>
<l>Of Humane Race, while the <hi>French</hi> name is grown </l>
<l>A Horrour to each Corner of the Earth; </l>
<l>But that like Devils we our selves should feel </l>
<l>Doubly the Torments we inflict on others; </l>
<l>Should on our Children endless Woes entail, </l>
<l>And grow the Curse ev'n of our own Posterity. </l>
<l>For what? That he o'er <hi>Europe</hi> may Insult: </l>
<l>Yes, by the Woes of us and our Insult. </l>
<l>What is't to us who Reigns, if we are Wretched? </l>
<l>And can we well be more? Is this our comfort, </l>
<l>That with our selves we make mankind too wretched? </l>
<l>A Comfort fit for Devils, not for Men.</l>

<l>And shall we use our Pow'r against our selves: </l>
