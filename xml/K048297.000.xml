been lucky enough to win it, now I am your steward; and as they sent you over here to Ireland, to collect the rents, to pay his Lordship's bonds to them, I'll go now about and make the tenants pay them into your hands, on condition you marry my daughter Rachel here.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dowd.</speaker>
<p>Fools! They never saw their landlord, Lord Esmond, since he was a boy. No, he spent his time and money flying over Italy and Germany, like a wild goose, till he's got himself now coop'd up in a prison at Paris! Ha, ha, ha! Come, Count, I hope to bring all the tenants to reason—but that sneering rascal Jack Connor—Daughter, I insist you'll never speak to him.</p>

<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>My dear Jack Connor, I love him more than ever for his fidelity to my Lord; and surely the man of honour and integrity can never prove a faithless lover. <stage>(<hi>Enter</hi> Adelaide.)</stage> Ah, you sly one! you come down here to the country on a visit to me, yet prefer birds and groves to all we can invent to amuse you.—Now is n't it love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adelaide.</speaker>
<p>My dear Rachel, I'd make you my confidante, but you're such a giddy creature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>I! Me? Ha, ha, ha! What would I give that you had a lover!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adelaide.</speaker>
<p>I had.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>O precious! Who is he?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adelaide.</speaker>
<p>Let these tears tell you my lover is no more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Dear me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adelaide.</speaker>
<p>'Tis now ten years since I saw my Nugent at Montpellier.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Ten years! You constant soul!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adelaide.</speaker>
<p>I was scarce fifteen: his fortune was doubtful; my father forbid our intercourse—my Nugent was seized by ruffians (I could never find the cause), and carried up to Paris; but have since been assured, by my father, of his death.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Lord! had I known, I should not have revived a painful idea.—Come, I must keep up your spirits. My father won't be home all night, and I've sent for my dear Jack Connor, to sup with us. Come, now, I wish I dare be angry with my father, for joining this sharping Count against his own master, Lord Esmond: no wonder, for his mother, the old lady, not to rest in her grave. Adelaide, as sure as I live, I heard the ghost sing last night in the Belvedere room—the sweetest voice!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adelaide.</speaker>
<p>Very strange! I've now sat up purposely three nights, but I've neither seen nor heard this wonder.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Oh, but my dear, the poor dead lady is certainly disturb'd by the misfortunes of her son, Lord Esmond:—it must be she, for the apparition is dress'd exactly like her picture that hangs in the room where it walks.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adelaide.</speaker>
<p>All fancy.—Ah! if the dead were suffer'd to revisit us, I should be comforted by my Nugent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Come, we must have no more thoughts of dead lovers:—you shall hear my living lover rattle, court, and sing at our little party; we'll be so jolly.—Come along.</p>

<p>Very well; take the horses back to the inn. Well, Trap, I've been your prisoner ten years, and your suffering me to come here from Paris is a stretch of good nature.—Yonder's my house: here am I in the centre of my own estate, and, thanks to fortune, not master of one foot of land.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Trap.</speaker>
<p>Night's coming on, and not a roof here will shelter us.

<p>Ah, merry be your hearts.—Good-night, neighbours.—All going to their comfortable homes; whilst I—this bachelor's life is plaguy stupid—I will marry my little Rachel.</p>

<p>Hollo! Friend, d'ye know where I can get a bed?</p>

<p>Affectionate fellow! <stage>(aside.)</stage> But I've heard say, my Lord is rather a dissipated worthless sort of character.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jack Connor.</speaker>

<p>A mystery there.—But <stage>(takes a horn of ale)</stage> I'll get to the bottom on't. <stage>(drinks.)</stage> Now I'm prim'd for love or war: if Frill dare but look crooked, or Mary but frown—oh! how I'll bang him, and touzle her.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord <hi>Esm.</hi></speaker>
<p>As I find all here have lost every remembrance of my person, I'll venture up to the castle, and see the Count, in my character of Nugent.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Jack Connor.</speaker>
<p>Phelim, let this gentleman want for nothing till I come home. Your hand, Sir; I was angry, but you're a stranger; perhaps in necessity—and my doors shall never be shut against the weary traveller.</p>

<speaker>Dowd.</speaker>
<p>Father Frank, what the Devil's this you've been doing?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. Frank.</speaker>
<p>Fie, fie! this is unseemly.—I've been joining this pair in holy wedlock, as you desired me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tough.</speaker>
<p>As you desired him, ha, ha, ha! Egad, 'tis my turn to laugh now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jack Connor.</speaker>
<p>Father-in-law, to keep the laugh from yourself, you'd best join in it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rachel.</speaker>
<p>Father, don't be angry, for upon the
<pb n="31" facs="34"/>
word of a bride, I had no notion of marriage,—but as you desired it, I complied, to show my obedience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dowd.</speaker>
<p>Oh, plague of your obedience.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Going in a rage.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Jack Connor.</speaker>
<p>Sir, father-in-law, here's the half-crown you won.</p>
</sp>
<stage>(<hi>Old</hi> Dowdle <hi>breaks from him, and exits in a fury.</hi>)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Tough.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! I'm so pleas'd. Jack, if you ev'n have my lamb, keep it, and let your lamb carve it for the wedding-day supper.</p>

<head>SCENE, <stage>Lord <hi>ESMOND</hi>'s House.</stage></head>
<stage>Enter <hi>MARY,</hi> and taps at the door.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Yes, by this my young lady's a bride, and if poor Muns hadn't been turn'd away, I might have been a bride.—Miss Adelaide! <stage>(<hi>taps at the door</hi>)</stage> Bless me! will she sleep all day?</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ADELAIDE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Adel.</speaker>
<p>'Tis very late. <stage>(<hi>Looks at her watch.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p>I ate! ha, ha, ha! now, Miss, hav'n't you been dreaming of your sweetheart?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adel.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Mary, the sweetest dream!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p>La, Miss, that's a vastly pretty ring: I never saw you wear it before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adel. </speaker>
<stage>(looking at her finger)</stage>
<p>Ring! Oh Heavens! is it possible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p>I must put your room to rights.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Adel.</speaker>
<p>This is the very ring I gave my Nugent
<pb n="32" facs="35"/>
at our last parting! If he should be still alive! Oh transport!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Re-enter</hi> MARY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p>La, Miss, as sure as I live, there's a door none of us ever saw from your chamber to the haunted room. I went through a long passage that goes all the way; and there's my old lady's clothes-press open'd, and all in such a confusion!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adel.</speaker>
<p>Do you know of any stranger here last night?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p>None, Miss, but he I put to sleep in the haunted room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adel.</speaker>
<p>Where is he?</p>
</sp>
<stage>(quick)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p>Gone, Ma'am, but Lord knows where.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adel.</speaker>
<p>It must have been my Nugent; every circumstance confirms it; and this ghost must have been I that walk'd in my sleep. I shudder to think of the dangers I've escap'd; but my Nugent lives, and danger vanishes.</p>
</sp>
<stage>aside.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> DOWDLE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Dowd.</speaker>
<p>Ah, jade! Pray, Miss, did you know of my daughter's elopement?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adel.</speaker>
<p>Dear Sir, did you see the gentleman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dowd.</speaker>
<p>The Devil's in the women! I ask about my daughter, and a gentleman is slap'd in my teeth! Hussey, were you her confidant? <stage>(<hi>to Mary.</hi>)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, can you think where Muns is gone?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dowd.</speaker>
<p>Get along, you jade, you and your Muns; the rascal, I suppose, is starving in a ditch by this— <stage>(<hi>a loud knocking.</hi>)</stage> Hey! what great man is this?</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="33" facs="36"/>
<hi>Enter</hi> MUNS, <hi>in a rich livery.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Muns.</speaker>
<p>Hey! nobody to throw open the gates—for us!—Hey!</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dowd.</speaker>
<p>You! you scoundrel, how dare you show your saucy face here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Muns. </speaker>
<stage>(without attending to <hi>Dowdle</hi>)</stage>
<p>Come, we must have the rooms now in some order. This table—chairs—sopha— <stage>(<hi>with great haste, and very consequentially he moves the furniture</hi>)</stage> We must have a total change here—by'r leave—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dowd.</speaker>
<p>Hey! Turn out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Muns.</speaker>
<p>Stop—we shall soon see which of us is to turn out.</p>

<p>Eh!</p>

<speaker>Count. </speaker>
<stage>(apart to <hi>Adelaide</hi>)</stage>
<p>Miss, say with us, and you shall ave de much money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Adel.</speaker>
<p>And does Mr. Nugent come here an impostor? Lord Esmond has been already too much wrong'd—deprived of liberty and fortune: and, though I never saw him, and once dearly loved you <stage>(<hi>to Ld.</hi> Esmond)</stage>, could I suppose you one of his unprincipled oppressors, I'd banish you for ever from my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. <hi>Esm.</hi></speaker>
<p>My Adelaide! what joy to prove your probity unshaken, as your innocence is spotless! I should scarce wish to recover my fortune, but to render myself more worthy of your love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="34" facs="37"/>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>He does act de Lord charmant; I must help him on. <stage>(<hi>aside</hi>)</stage> Monsieur Dowdle, I have received lettres from my friends in Paris; to shew dere generosité, dey desire me to deliver him up his bonds—Dere, my Lor. <stage>(<hi>gives Lord</hi> Esmond <hi>papers.</hi>)</stage> Now as we have no claim on his Lordship, I hope de tenants will now pay dere rents.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. <hi>Esm.</hi></speaker>
<p>I am sure, Count, I am vastly oblig'd to you for this,</p>
</sp>
<stage>(<hi>noise without</hi>)</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> JACK CONNER <hi>and</hi> RACHEL; <hi>he with a large stick stands before Lord</hi> Esmond.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Jack Connor.</speaker>
<p>I'll die before they take my Lord again to a gaol.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> TRAP, <hi>and Officers.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. <hi>Esm.</hi></speaker>
<p>So, Connor, you'll die for me, and not return to sup with me? ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jack Connor. </speaker>
<stage>(looking at Ld. <hi>Esmond</hi>)</stage>
<p>And was it you, my Lord, I affronted at my house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. <hi>Esm.</hi></speaker>
<p>My old friend, neither time nor dignity has erased the affection of our boyish days.—As for my steward—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jack Connor.</speaker>
<p>My Lord, my first request is, pardon for my father-in-law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dowd.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Jack! you know how freely I gave you my daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>And I have lost ma chere Rachel—Ah! malheureux!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trap.</speaker>
<p>But now, my Lord you'd as good think of coming back to my house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. <hi>Esm.</hi></speaker>
<p>I thank you, Trap, but I prefer my own.—Restor'd to my estate, I will satisfy all my creditors; and, be assured, I will take care to indemnify you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="35" facs="38"/>
<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<p>Diable! Are you really my Lord Esmond? Oh, I am ruined!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ld. <hi>Esm.</hi></speaker>
<p>My ruin, I hope, will teach our nobility, instead of travelling to become the dupes of foreign sharpers, to stay at home and spend their fortunes amongst their honest tenants, who support their splendour—Trap, you have been long my gaoler, now I'll be yours;—but liberty shall be your punishment—hospitality the lock of my prison—and honest Muns my turnkey, to give a welcome to the kind friend, social neighbour, and, above all, the stranger in distress.</p>
