<speaker>Whitski.</speaker>
<p>MAKE way there for the King—here he comes—here comes the great Casimir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rad.</speaker>
<p>That slave I do remember—save thee, fellow!—whose vassal art thou?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wit.</speaker>
<p>Marry, courteous stranger, I tend the mill of the Lord Rodomsko, Castellan of Wounitz, here in Cracovia.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rad.</speaker>
<p>Rememberest thou the Lord Radzano?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wit.</speaker>
<p>Remember him—alack! the day—the last time I beheld his gallant form, was on the battlements
<pb n="2" facs="4"/>
of his castle—then a very stripling—when my present Lord besieged it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rad.</speaker>
<p>So then, Radzano was by force expelled—pry'thee the story.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wit.</speaker>
<p>If this addle pate of mine play me no trick, marry, thus it was—during the troubles of the late reign—peaceful right was elbow'd out by warlike might—then Rodomsko our present Lord, taking 'vantage of the time, when our troops were on the frontier, tugging with the common enemy, made inroad on us: On this, Radzano hied him back to his castle; but, alack! might cuffed down right, and, in the encounter, our good and brave lord was slain—Ah! stranger, that was a grievous day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rad.</speaker>
<p>So—I still am lord then of my vassals hearts.—Fellow, I thank thee for thy story; a day may come when I'll requite thy love for thy lost lord—but soft, the King.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wit.</speaker>
<p>Aye, here he comes—so majestic, and yet so humble; so just; and yet so merciful—the benizon of heaven light on him! he's the poor man's friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rad. </speaker>

<speaker>Chorus of Peasants.</speaker>
<lg type="song">
<l>HAIL! mighty King!</l>
<l>'Tis love that elevates our strains,</l>
<l>'Tis joy the swelling note sustains,</l>
<l>To thee we call,</l>
<l>Welcome as the God of day,</l>
<l>Who pours his animating ray</l>
<l>Alike on all.</l>
<l>Hail! mighty King!</l>

<stage>During the Chorus, Guards, Officers, and Nobles enter in Procession—at the concluson, the King, Cardinal, and Nobles.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Casimir </speaker>
<stage>(to the Cardinal)</stage>
<p>By my faith! well, urged—Lord Cardinal your words befit as well the objects of true policy, as they attune with the holy mandate of your calling. Yes! our country shall have peace! true; these Teutonic Knights have disgraced their order, turning from christian service and true chivalry, to deeds of usurpation and dominion! yet nerved, tho' we are to check these ravagers; it befits us rather with firm expostulation to meet our enemy than risk our subjects blood in keen encounter—let conquerors astound the ear with the din of war, the trumpets clangor, and the groans of captives—be mine the clamours of my people's love.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="4" facs="6"/><hi>As the King passes on,</hi> RADZANO <hi>kneels</hi>—CASIMIR <hi>takes the Petition—looks at it—stops suddenly, and with scrutinizing eye, examines</hi> RADZANO—<hi>approaches him.</hi></stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<p>Amazement!—my good Lords proceed you to the Diet. <stage>(Exeunt Lords. He waves his hand to the people, who exeunt).</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rad.</speaker>
<p>My gracious King!<stage>(kneels.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<p>Rise to my heart—say, what fair fortune has preserved thee to me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rad.</speaker>
<p>A woman good, my liege, and fair as fortune e'er was pictured, yet, in sooth, without her fickleness; and only blind in her fond love of me. My King may well remember when I left the embattled frontier.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<p>Remember it! by my sword, I had reason; for with thee went this body's buckler—oh my best soldier—'twas this arm first taught thee the rudiments of war, when scarcely truncheon high; but my love breaks in upon thy story—on—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rad.</speaker>
<p>I reached my castle time enough to see its ruin—Rodomsko triumphed. In a remote apartment, constructed for concealment, I lay hid, hoping for life and better days; that apartment was selected for Rodomsko's daughter, the beauteous Rosolia, to her pitying ear I told my story; and her soft bosom, rich in nature's best
<pb n="5" facs="7"/>
endowments, soon matured compassion into love. At a fit time I fled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<p>Whither, good Radzano?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rad.</speaker>
<p>To England, my loved Lord; there I sojourned till fame proudly proclaimed, that justice was again enthroned in Poland, for there reigned great Casimir; for that justice thus I bend my knee! and my boon is, that my tongue may denounce Rodomsko, villain! and my good sword avenge my wrongs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<p>Then, I refuse thy boon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rad.</speaker>
<p>Dread liege! heaven will make the good cause prosperous!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<p>Radzano, link not heaven with murder!—if heaven recognized the sword's arbitrament, Rodomsko ne'er had triumphed—droop not my friend—by my crown thou shalt have justice!—even now in angry parle I meet Rodomsko! these hot lords, who live but in a storm, urge me to renew the war—but of that hereafter—uncloud thee—be thyself—attend me at the Diet—once more Radzano, welcome!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rac.</speaker>
<p>Dear Sir! then what makes you look so terrible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ama.</speaker>
<p>It's the mild tender passion of love— <stage>(with amorous fervor)</stage> You know, Rachel, 'twas for your sake, I did not turn your fader Witski, out of his mill to starve, tho' he dare laugh at me—me, Amalekite Grabowski, chief agent to Lord Rodomsko—Castellan of Wounitz in Cracovia; so you sees how I loves you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rac.</speaker>
<p>Oh! I'm sure you dont; for lovers sigh, and kneel, and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ama.</speaker>
<p>Kneel; oh, dear! I cannot do's dat—what a pity's love is such a foe to dignity! I say, Rachel; <stage>(looks to see whether the peasants observe him)</stage> I say—how do you contrive to have so soft a hand? <stage>(enter Witski)</stage> I should suppose, labours would

make it hard; <stage>(fumbling and kissing it)</stage> but I declare its as smooth and as soft—bless my soul— <stage>(during this, Witski advances, bows low and close to Ama. who, by accident, lays his hand on his head)</stage> Oh Lud! vat ish dat—stand off.</p>

<speaker>Wit.</speaker>
<p>You know, Sir, you always told me to shew you homage.</p>

<speaker>Ama.</speaker>
<p>Yes▪ but at an awful distance.</p>

<p>True; but seeing your honour so close to my daughter, I thought I might be treated in the family way. <stage>(laughs aside).</stage></p>

<p>Yes, indeed you were, Sir.</p>

<p>Your Lord Radzano greets you, e'en now he is arrived in Cracow, to claim his rights, and crush that usurper Rodomsko—bless my soul!—do you win the vassals to his interest—he who brings this will instruct you further; be faithful, and you will be rewarded. RADZANO.</p>
<p>Bless my soul, what shall I do? Radzano has the right; but then Rodomsko has the possession—
<pb n="9" facs="11"/>
bless my conscience, what shall I do? then Radzano is in great favour with the King—bless my conscience, what shall I do? but then Rodomsko is in great favour with the nobility—bless my conscience, what shall I do?</p>

<p>Oh! he keeps the slaves in proper subjections.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>O'Cur.</speaker>
<p>Proper subjection! I'll tell you what, he appears to me like the great tall thistle in the potatoe garden, which bothers every one who touches it, and prevents the humble fruit from arriving at the wholesome maturity nature intended. Oh! I wish I had the docking of him—now my Lord

Radzano is so humane, so polished, so—gallant—so—</p>

</sp>

<speaker>O'Cur.</speaker>
<p>Oh! he has been sucking in the breath of it in little England, Mr. Amalekite. Oh! confound your name; could not they have called you Nebuchadnezzar, or Mac Laughlin, or O'Shaughnessy, or any easy agreeable name of that sort—Oh! we shall have such jolly doings; every heart will wear the face of joy, and all countenances, men, women, cows, Jews, and sheep, must all be on the broad grin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ama.</speaker>
<p>I must consider—which of my Lords shall I betray?—bless my conscience—slaves treat this stranger with all respect, and give him the song of welcome—you will follow me. It's a very, puzzling case; Radzano has the right—Rodomsko has—bless my conscience!</p>

<p>In pursuance of our purpose, we have appointed my Lord Cardinal our ambassador, to conclude a peace with the Teutonick Knights.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>Peace! Is then a soldier, the world's right arm, to wither and decay, that hordes of priests, with their beads and crosiers, may preach us into cowards? but I wonder not! for since the great Zorinski was disgraced—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<p>What of him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>He was honest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<p>He was proud and inflexible! but forbear to name him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>Since, Sire, you have banished from your councils those hardy spirits, who alone were fit to aid the public weal, naught now will down but peace—the general good—these are the entrapping blandishments held out, for emancipating slaves, privileging towns, and using every circumventive art to crush the power of the nobility!—peace! let my Lord Cardinal preach its blessings—I hate it! What gentlemen of Poland shall your goodly cimeters canker in their sheaths, while those usurping Knights despoil your borders?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cas. </speaker>
<stage>(coming forward)</stage>
<p>Fiery Lord! hear me. If it be my duty to root out usurpation and foul conspiracy, why need I wage the war on Pomorania's borders, when my eye's scope comprehends an object that would give vengeance full employment?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>Sire! Rodomsko scorns base fear! nor will he shun enquiry—thou would'st demand, how
<pb n="13" facs="15"/>
came I by my power; my answer is, by valourous achievement—by conquest—the soldier's tenure! but why waste we words? Radzano being dead—who is there?—</p>

<p>Behold the wronged Radzano! what can'st thou urge?</p>

<p>I cannot battle it with words—'twas this good arm that gave me power; 'tis this good arm that will maintain it!—follow me—thou wilt not find it palsied, boy.</p>
<stage>(both going)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<p>On your allegiance, hold!—still the friend to gentle peace; still anxious to preserve the most rebellious drop of subjects blood—let me propose between you terms, where love may grow, and honour ratify them. Rodomsko, Radzano loves thy daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!</p>

<p>Let her be mediatrix between you; let holy marriage with their hands unite your hearts; so live in equal power and love—what says Radzano?</p>

<p>Oh, Radzano! let me pour into thy breast my griefs—the wrongs I bear from these injurious lords press hard upon me! but I am rich in poor men's prayers, and that's a kingly solace. Oh, I would rise unto my people, like the god of day to Lapland's icy sons, after his wintry absence! What, not a word Radzano? I see the lover dulls the patriot—but I forgive it—away to thy Rosolia—yet mark her father—watch well Rodomsko—e'en now conspiracy's at work against my throne and—person: yet spite of impending

Forty chosen men are ready for the achievement, waiting but a leader—know, Rodomsko, in thy mines dwells a man fashioned to conduct the daring enterprize—seek him instantly—the brave fellow who brings this, by whose dejected brow thou'lt see he's ripe for murder, will conduct thee to the man we seek—farewel! and triumph.—Now tremble, Casimir—But soft, the—messenger from the Lords approaches—what says my letter?<stage>(enter O'Curragh, smiling)</stage> dejected brow! if the mind's construction be indexed in the face, this man bears sweet content about him—Health to thee, friend!</p>

<p>Ah! no. I have heard there was a good law once, that made a Lord pay a fine for killing a man, but it's never put in force now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>"O'Cur.</speaker>
<p>A fine for killing a man!—a good old law do you call that?—What a devil of a spot have I got into here!—oh! what a picked place is little Ireland to this—we're poor enough to be sure; but what of that? we can fight when we please, can work when we please, aye, and starve when we please; and we can flourish our shelalahs, and strut about our potatoe garden like a collection of Emperors.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Rac.</speaker>
<p>Would Zorinski kill thee?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Zar.</speaker>
<p>No; but I would kill myself for having betrayed him! Know then, in that dreary mine dwells, the great Zorinski—mark—when Casimir was crowned, Zorinski, who was all in all with the late King, could not bear the thwarts Casimir put on him; a quarrel ensued, and my master, tho' I love him, was much to blame; disgrace followed. His house, which had been the hive of courtiers, became deserted—away they flew—his great soul could not brook it! with despairing brow and knotted arms I saw him leave the city; and sadly he walked along till he reached the opening of the mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rac.</speaker>
<p>What to throw himself down head-long, and end his life?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Zar.</speaker>
<p>I dreaded it! so fell at his feet: He took me by the hand; a big tear fell on it; he blushed, called me his faithful Zarno—bade me farewel!
<pb n="23" facs="25"/>
and gave me liberty—from that moment I became his slave—we descended. into the mine, and I have attended him, and carried him his food—aye, and ever will. Ah, my dear master, never will Zarno leave thee! I shared his prosperity, and shall I desert him now? no! no! Now Rachel thou hast the secret, and thus I seal it up—farewel!</p>

<p>What could I do?—live with men to blast me with their pity?—no; when disgrace pursued, I earthed me here, lest, Acteon like, I should be hunted by that yelping pack of courtly knaves, my bounty had given breath to.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Zorinski, again to fold thee, and at an hour of such dread moment.—Oft have I, in the senate, mourned thy loss—but instant leave this den—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Zo.</speaker>
<p>To the world again?—What should I there—but cast a mournful look around, and, on the wide surface of nature, see nothing I could claim, except a grave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Away with this—by manhood, 'tis baby weakness.—Oh, Zorinski, there are purposes— <stage>(the noise of a bugle horn is heard above)</stage>—Casimir hawks to day.</p>

<p>Aye—Again he treads upon me. <stage>(looking up.)</stage></p>

are ripe for action; and, let but thy aspiring soul resume its energy—</p>

<p>Oh, thou hast poured again into this breast ambition's godlike impulse. Tell me, Rodomsko, can the devotion of this life, this soul, forward the illustrious cause?</p>

<p>Most mightily, for the fate of Poland hangs upon thy breath.</p>

<p>Are you going to leave us, Zarno?</p>
</sp>

<p>Yes; for though this is certainly a very delectable situation, yet I find, by consulting my glass, it rather annoys the complexion; and, my physicians say, that this air induces spleen and melancholy.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>Enjoying the richest luxury of greatness— seeing the poor made happy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>Aye, by whom?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>E'en my intended lord— <stage>(Zorinski starts)</stage> this day he hath given freedom to his vassals, and much I joyed to behold wretched man rescued from abject slavery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Zo.</speaker>
<p>Loveliest maiden, thy tender nature ne'er can impose chains, save those of love's soft thraldrom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>By heaven he's caught—Rosolia, I here present thy father's dearest friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros</speaker>
<p>Deign, Sir, to receive my hearty greeting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Zo. </speaker>
<stage>(salutes her)</stage>
<p>The fascinating poison thrills my every nerve—all powerful love—love—ar't mad Zorinski—thou who scorn'st to flatter others—be to thyself consistent—is this rugged frame shaped for love's soft dalliance—do amorous
<pb n="47" facs="49"/>
whispers soft as the zephyr, come from a voice chill and surly as the northern blast—is this scowling eye, now rife with murder, a place for Cupids to ambush in—mockery all—yet, on my soul, I dare not trust my eyes to look upon her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roso.</speaker>
<p>He seems much moved.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>Thou hast done well my girl—bid him farewell, and get thee in.</p>

<stage>(with surly irritation)</stage>
<p>Casimir, do'st thou again thwart me?</p>

<p>E'en now the King is journeying hither with his young friend, to consummate the union.</p>

<p>Aye, but, should a real friend to Poland think her worthy—never.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>Oh Zorinski! act but to night as doth become thee—vindicate thy owa wrongs, avenge the Lords of Poland, and—receive my daughter to thy arms; for by her blushing beauties I swear she's thine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="48" facs="50"/>
<speaker>Zo.</speaker>
<p>Oh Rodomsko! tempt me not beyond man's bearing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>Dull man, I tempt thee to a throne—Casimir being disposed of—his place must be supplied; and whom will thy peers deem so fit to guard their rights, as he who crushed their fell destroyer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Zo.</speaker>
<p>If thou wilt place before me temptations more than mortal, he must be more than mortal that resists—by hell I'm thine—Casimir or Zorinski falls—so may my soul find life or death eternal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<p>But this night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Zo.</speaker>
<p>The better.</p>

<p>And mark; should chance so order it; bring Casimir alive—the confederate lords demand him for their vengeance—a band, whose steely hearts are rivetted with oaths, will aid thee.</p>

<p>I need them not—let daws cling together—the eagle flies alone.</p>

<p>Away with this romantic folly—within there is prepared a solemn sacrament, think on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Zo.</speaker>
<p>If thou would'st have me act this deed; oh let me <hi>not</hi> think, Rodomsko—but on the instant give me the deadly oath—aye, 'tis well conceived—'twill save revolt and cowardly compunction—for oh the dread interval will be a hellish purgatory, but it leads to a heaven of

<p>OH!

<p>Let them come on; this weight of guilt taken from this arm, I will protect thee, King—Virtue's electric fire so springs each nerve, that did nature loose her ravenous kind—did hell oppose its ministers of blood, I seem as with one blow I could sweep them to destruction.</p>

<p>No more; thou hast unclogged thy soul of treason; treason, that most hideous murder, which, with one blow, severs a nation's peace, tramples down law, that barrier of existence, and gives to him most triumph, who most shall murder and destroy. <stage>Exeunt, King leaning on Zorinski.</stage></p>
