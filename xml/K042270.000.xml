<p>THE PERPLEXITIES: A COMEDY.</p>
<p>As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN <hi>COVENT-GARDEN.</hi></p>
<p><hi>Conamur tenues grandia.</hi> HORAT.</p>
<p>LONDON: Printed for W. GRIFFIN, in Catharine-Street in the Strand; and G. KEARSLY, in Ludgate-Street. 1767.</p>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THE editor of this Comedy thinks it his duty to declare that, in point of fable, he is entirely indebted to an old play, wrote by <hi>Sir Samuel Tuke,</hi> called the <hi>Adventures of Five Hours;</hi> of which piece <hi>Echard,</hi> in the preface to his translation of <hi>Terence,</hi> after noticing some particular excellencies, gives this general character; viz.</p>
<quote>This is one of the pleasantest stories, that ever appeared upon our stage, and has as much variety of plots and intrigues, without any thing being precipitated, improper, or unnatural, as to the main action.</quote>
<p>This encomium, and the request of a particular friend, induced an attempt to restore so excellent a story to the stage. Finding, on examination of the original, the language to consist entirely of measure and rhyme, a style by no means suited to the use of comedy, it appeared indispensably necessary to <hi>new-write</hi> it. This arduous task was not undertaken without much fear and diffidence. If the piece, as it now stands, should be fortunate enough to meet the least favour, the editor will, with the utmost readiness, charge such success to his having, in <hi>general,</hi> adhered closely to the <hi>Original,</hi> pursued the
<pb facs="3"/>
same disposition of scenery, and preserved as many of the sentiments as could be introduced, without clogging, or interrupting the action. What <hi>particular</hi> alterations he has presumed to make, are, with great deference, submitted to the Candour of the Public.</p>
<p>Since the copy was delivered to the press, some few passages have been shortened in representation, which are easily distinguishable by the attentive reader.</p>
<p>⁂ This Comedy having been treated with very distinguished marks of candour and encouragement, in the representation, the Editor thinks it his duty to return his most grateful thanks to the Public.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<stage>Mr. BEARD enters hastily.</stage>
<lg>
<l>I Speak a Prologue!—What strange whim, I wonder,</l>
<l>Could lead the author into such a blunder?—</l>
<l>I ask'd the man as much—but he (poor devil!)</l>
<l>Fancied a Manager might make you civil.</l>
<l><hi>"Garrick</hi> (says he) can with a Prologue tame</l>
<l>"The Critic's rage—Why can't you do the same?"</l>
<l>Because (quoth I) the case is diff'rent quite;</l>
<l><hi>Garrick,</hi> you know, can Prologues speak, and write;</l>
<l>If like that <hi>Roscius</hi> I could write, and speech it,</l>
<l>I might command applause, and not beseech it.</l>
<l>But, sure, for one who, all his live-long days,</l>
<l>Has dealt in Crotchets, Minims, and Sol-fa's,</l>
<l>A Singer, to stand forth in Wit's defence,</l>
<l>And plead 'gainst Sound the solemn cause of Sense;</l>
<l>Persuade an audience that a play has merit,</l>
<l>Without a single Air to give it spirit;</l>
<l>'Tis so much out of character—so wrong—</l>
<l>No Prologue, sir, for me,—unless in Song.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The fame (quoth I) you poets reap,</l>
<l>And all your gains, are owing,</l>
<l>To sounds that even measure keep,</l>
<l>And stanzas smoothly flowing:</l>
<l>But me the lyre wou'd better suit</l>
<l>Than verses of Apollo;</l>
<l>The fiddle, hautboy, horn, or flute,</l>
<l>I'm always us'd to follow.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Sir (says he) you'll mar</l>
<l>"My verse and meaning too"—</l>
<l>Sir, must I turn fool,</l>
<l>To humour such as you?</l>
<l>I'll sing it if you please—</l>
<l>"Sing! cries he, in huff,</l>
<l>"Of you and your Sol-fa's</l>
<l>"The town has had enough"—</l>
<l><pb facs="5"/>
Oh! then I bounc'd and swore—</l>
<l>Was I much to blame?</l>
<l>Had you been in my place,</l>
<l>Why you'd have done the same.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>If for old-fashion'd tunes he's not too nice,</l>
<l>I'd give him fifty of 'em in a trice,</l>
<l>With words more fitted to his purpose here,</l>
<l>Than all the rhimes he'd jingle in a year.</l>
<l>He challeng'd me to shew a single sample</l>
<l>Of what I bragg'd—I did—as for example!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The scene is prepar'd, the Critics are met,</l>
<l>The judges all rang'd—a terrible shew!</l>
<l>E're tryal begins the Prologue's a debt,</l>
<l>A debt on demand—so take what we owe.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And this is the way, Mr. Author,</l>
<l>To trick a plain muse up with art,</l>
<l>In modish Fal-lal's you must cloathe her,</l>
<l>And warm a cold Critic's hard heart.</l>
<l>With a Fal-lal-lal, &amp;c.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Wherefore I thus entreat, with due submission,</l>
<l>Between the bard and me you'd make decision.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The whole now on your arbitration we rest,</l>
<l>And Prologues henceforward shall surely be drest,</l>
<l>In what mode soever your taste shall like best,</l>
<l>Which none of us dare deny.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>For, howe'er cruel critics and witlings may sneer,</l>
<l>That at times I, alas! somewhat <hi>dunny</hi> appear,</l>
<l>If to you, my best friends, I e'er <hi>turn my deaf ear,</hi></l>
<l>May you your indulgence deny!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Then, for his sake and mine, (for we're both in a fright)</l>
<l>Till a treat of more goût shall your palates delight,</l>
<l>Let a poor humble Comedy please you to-night;</l>
<l>Which surely you will not deny.</l>

<head>ACT I. SCENE I.</head>
<div3 type="scene">
<head>SCENE, <stage><hi>Don</hi> HENRIQUEZ, <hi>and Don</hi> JUAN.</stage></head>
<sp>
<speaker>HENRIQUEZ.</speaker>
<p>NO more, cousin, I beseech you; all your rhetoric will not persuade me to leave so important a care, as the honour of our family, to the caprice of a giddy girl. It was a charge committed absolutely to me, by our parents, on their death-bed, and I alone must be answerable for any blemish on that honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>I have no doubt, Don <hi>Henriquez,</hi> but that this your extreme haste takes it's rise from prudence; but may not even our virtues be sometimes overstrain'd, and have their dangerous effects?
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
'Tis from this fear, that I have often presum'd to interpose, and must repeat it; wou'd it not be better to let your sister see, and make herself acquainted with the disposition of, the man with whom she is to pass her life?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Which is, in other words, to give her more opportunity for devices, and to try whether she cannot frustrate my designs—no, no,—an agreeable young girl shou'd never be left to her own direction;—tricks, plots, and contrivances are so innate in them, they will couzen themselves rather than their imaginations shou'd want employment; I have seen too many instances of their vanity, giddiness, ingratitude; well—well!—I have, within this hour, receiv'd intelligence from the Marquis <hi>d'Olivera,</hi> thro' whose generous intervention my designs are, at last, come to maturity, that the person, to whom she has been so long contracted, Don <hi>Antonio de Mendoza—</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>Is he the man? The very name removes half my objections. Why has it been so long concealed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Because I wou'd not give my sister's enterprising genius either time, or means, to counteract my purposes—but now, the prospect of a speedy conclusion of the whole affair renders that secrecy no longer necessary; this evening he will arrive from <hi>Flanders;</hi> and so well convinc'd am I of the propriety of my conduct, I will not sleep, till they are married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>Notwithstanding his undoubted merit, I cannot yet be reconcil'd to that unreasonable custom of contracting persons, who never saw each other; compelling them to be of the same opinion, in the most important concern of life, before you know whether they cou'd agree about the most insignificant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>I wou'd only compel her to her good, and think I am the best judge what measures to pursue.—Opinions indeed!—If you, Don <hi>Juan,</hi> delay the disposal of your sister in marriage, till she is able to determine what her opinion is, or (to express myself conformably to your easy temper) till she has fix'd her affections, she may give you a brother-in-law very ill suited to your choice, and judgment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>Strange! that your understanding, education, and travels, shou'd not have allay'd that severe opinion of women; by strangers imputed to us as a national fault, and indeed with too much justice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Persons, who cannot comprehend the motives, which actuate such as are wiser than themselves, ever make strange interpretations of their conduct. I am determin'd no longer to endure the daily, the hourly anxieties, and fears, which a solicitude for <hi>Honoria</hi>'s conduct has given me; this night they end.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>I have had the like charge of a sister, you know, these thirteen years, and cannot recollect a pain mine ever gave to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>The comparison don't hold; their dispositions are different; yet, I wish, Don <hi>Juan,</hi> you may not suffer for your easiness of temper; you give the reins too much into your sister's hands; the thoughtlessness of youth, and passions uncontroul'd, may lead her far astray; 'tis too much to be fear'd; I have strong reasons, have nicely weigh'd her conduct—you may repent—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>I know what you allude to; but the transactions of that fatal night are far from alarming me about <hi>Felicia</hi>'s conduct; 'tis true, Don <hi>Pedro</hi> was kill'd under my balcony; you throw the deed on <hi>Florio,</hi> and his flight seems to justify the accusation; yet, what reproach does this cast on
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
her? For when I offer'd, in consequence of your assertion, that he had dishonourable designs on her, to interfere with you in his behalf, to stop the prosecution, and give her hand to him, if her happiness consisted therein, she utterly declin'd it; assuring me she had no one motive to wish for such an event, but many to avoid it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>You are too blind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>And you too suspicious; why shou'd she deceive me? Have I not ever assur'd her I wou'd consult her inclination?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Ay, there's the curse, that ties my tongue.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>I therefore cannot, will not doubt her. Her heart is generous and honest; on such dispositions, indulgence weighs more than severity; and cou'd you be induc'd to alter your conduct towards <hi>Honoria—</hi>but I ask pardon; your own judgment must be your director; short as my absence has been, events may have occur'd, which may render me now an incompetent adviser.—Your sister is mistress of many virtues; and fame speaks loudly of <hi>Antonio,</hi> as a man, a scholar, and a soldier.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>On those considerations, let our argument die. I am determin'd. Will you accompany me to our friend and kinsman the corregidor? I wou'd require him to be a witness, and partaker of our ceremonies to-night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>I will but conduct my sister to her cousin <hi>Honoria,</hi> to whom she has devoted this evening, and attend you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Shall I expect you in the Piazza?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>You may.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>A man, with a heart at ease like his, may well preach such doctrine; but I carry a load of inquietude in mine.—My sister married, one
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
weighty care is remov'd, but a far heavier remains.—Ungrateful, blind <hi>Felicia!—</hi>what sufferings am I doom'd to undergo, yet know not how to utter or relieve them! to love, adore, doubt, fear, suspect, despair, yet still persist to love! I blush at my own weakness—to apply, and be refus'd, were a perpetual thorn to me! and that, from her blind prepossession to another, and <hi>Juan</hi>'s passive acquiescence to her choice, is almost certain! rivall'd too in her affections by a man, who, but a short time before, had ask'd my sister of me; my pride, my honour is insulted; revenge is my only remedy; in that I will persist, and experience its utmost efficacy.</p>

<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Wou'd <hi>Felicia</hi> were come! her kind and chearful temper might give me some relief—Yet how can I expect it? This tyrant brother! can I call him less! to compel me to marry a man I never saw, while the chosen of my heart is forc'd to avoid me—is rejected. My brother's hatred cou'd scarce entail on me a greater misery than his care—Yet what can I do?

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>With pleasure I escort my sister to so dear and amiable a friend—methinks 'tis pity even a wall shou'd make the houses two, of neighbours so entirely one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and the houses are more entirely one, than you imagine, my dear brother; thanks to our private door.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>We have ever thought the slightest separation, inconsistent with our friendship—You oblige me with a most welcome favour in uniting us now; 'tis a degree of charity, and I thank you. Am I to be honour'd with your company too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>I cou'd with great pleasure stay, but an engagement with your brother calls me; and the least trespass on his punctilious temper, you know—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Shall I call my cousin mine for the night?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>Her own inclination is her ruler. Your most obedient.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>There's a brother for you—upon my word if he were not so related, I shou'd be apt to mistake him for a lover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>And give him encouragement perhaps?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Undoubtedly, if my heart were free, and I cou'd be convinc'd that same politeness would not abate on marriage; a little of that, you know, goes a great way in a husband—But am I never to see my sweet friend smile again?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>I wou'd willingly put off my grief, to avoid disturbing your gaiety, but am not able.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Then let me put off my gaiety, that I may not interrupt your grief; there is often ease in the indulgence of it, and I am too giddy for you. Tell me, my dear <hi>Honoria,</hi> how can I metamorphose myself so as to suit your feelings? I wou'd be, or do, any thing that might give you pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>You never fail to do that.—Your every look, and word, has affection in it; and that agreeable manner of setting them off, makes what wou'd be stil'd levity in others, a virtue in you, as it's only spring is from a desire to entertain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel</speaker>
<p>Deliver'd with singular judgment, and politeress: your's to the very ground.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Engaging playfulness! how can so tender, so susceptible a heart as yours be so much at ease, in it's present doubtful, and anxious situation?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Why that's true—and it is sometimes otherwise; but as I have not to charge fortune, or friends, with any actual affliction, I bear accidental ills as well as I am able, and endeavour to keep sorrow at arm's length. My hopes, I think, grow faster than my fears, and I trust to the great midwife, Time, to bring forth the fruits of 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>And may they answer your deserts! I have almost lost a part of my grief, in my amazement at the adventures you were relating to me last night, when my lordly brother interrupted us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Yes, absence is a pretty whet to affection, now and then; he is ten times worse than ever; there's no getting a moment now; his love, and jealousy, together keep him in a perpetual fidget.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>I cou'd not sleep, for thinking of your story.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Ay, is it not a fine one? since the days of don <hi>Quixotte,</hi> to this present seven o'clock in the evening, sure never was a better subject for romance—Let me see, I'll enumerate the particulars: Travels—Surprizes—Wars—Drums—Trumpets,—taken prisoner—attack'd by a ruffian—sav'd by a heroic self-defence!—Swooning!—Recovery!—and such a recovery! in the arms of a handsome young fellow! O lud! cousin!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Who had kill'd the attempter of your honour too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Oh! no—you forget—I had the credit of the victory over him—As soon as he began to use violence, I seiz'd his dagger, and menac'd his destruction, (ay and meant it too) when a sudden alarm, and fear for his own safety, reliev'd me from the monster.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>But how came you depriv'd of your brother's assistance?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>I was coming to that, when Don <hi>Henriquez</hi> interrupted us—in defending himself, and me, (which he did, a long time, with great galantry, ere we were taken prisoners) he receiv'd some slight wounds, and was lodg'd in an upper apartment of the house.—I was taken to a pavilion in the garden, which, I presume, the wretch, who assaulted me, thought most fit for his wicked purposes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Your attachments to your relation, the Count <hi>D'Oniate,</hi> and the concern your brother had in his embassy to the emperor, threaten'd surely a longer absence. What occasion'd your return?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>My brother was suddenly recall'd to his regiment, by royal command; and the necessity for using dispatch in our return to <hi>Sevil,</hi> induc'd him to take the nearest road—too near the enemies quarters—and thence we were made prisoners.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>I am sure, I have sensibly partaken every fear, and distress, during your relation, and lament the necessity, that involv'd you in such perplexities, tho' it restor'd so much of my happiness to me—And you dearly love the noble soldier, who offered to revenge your injuries, or die beside you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Most entirely.—I always speak truth, you know: if a sudden passion, a first-sight love, is justifiable in any one, it is surely so in me; I suppose gratitude may have some share; but then such a person, such looks, such words—however, I am mistaken, if I did not leave him as much cause to remember the adventure, as he did me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Why then did he leave you so abruptly?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>What cou'd the poor soul do? the trumpets summon'd him, his men call'd loudly for their commander; there was, to be sure, a notable
<pb n="9" facs="15"/>
combat between love and honour, but honour got the better, and I honour him for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>And what was this gallant hero's name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>I know not; I had neither means, nor time, to enquire: the moment my brother had recover'd some few hours strength, we were oblig'd to set off—But enough of my affairs; how stand my sweet friend's?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Worse, and worse, <hi>Felicia,—</hi>so near a crisis, that my brother is determin'd on my marrying this night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>My brother hinted as much, as we came here; but I cou'd scarce believe it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>'Tis too true<hi>—Henriquez</hi> has just receiv'd advice, that the person, to whom I am contracted, will arrive this evening.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>How absurd, and cruel! and poor <hi>Florio—</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Now doubly banish'd; first from my brother's positive forbiddance of his addresses, and visits, on account of this unhappy contract; and then, from the ill-fated death of Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> whom, in self-defence, you know, he kill'd: if he is found, my brother's evidence must condemn him to the law, and his resentment seeks all occasions to compass the most severe gratifications.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Rash, inconsiderate, unfeeling man! Was not his savage love of me the cause, which drives him hourly to some mad extreme? Then that unlucky similitude of dress, which led him to believe <hi>Florio</hi> was entertaining me, that fatal evening, in our balcony! nay, allowing his suspicions had been grounded in truth, cou'd nothing appease him, but assassinating <hi>Florio,</hi> and hazarding his friend Don <hi>Pedro</hi> in so bafe a cause? Can he suppose such desperate, such terrifying proofs of passion, (which while his pride will not suffer him to own, he weakly fancies is unseen) wou'd not disgust my heart?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>However he has disdain'd to trust a woman, I wonder his friendship with your brother has not induc'd him to ask your hand of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Oh my dear! two most weighty reasons are against it; first his pride, lest he shou'd be refus'd; secondly, my brother's strong dislike of forc'd marriages, to which he is no stranger; tho', between you and me, my dear, my brother is as well convinc'd of his passion, as we are; and proceeded so far, as to apply to me thereon; but finding my aversion, my horror at the very mention of it, according to his accustom'd tenderness, he has never since re-assum'd the topic; but has <hi>Henriquez</hi> at last graciously been pleas'd to tell you your intended husband's name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>He has, <hi>Felicia,</hi> this day at dinner; not a moment sooner.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>May not I know it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>He is call'd <hi>Antonio de Mendoza.</hi></p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> HENRIQUEZ.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>I am pleas'd, <hi>Honoria,</hi> to hear you talking of your husband; it gives me hope your conduct will deserve the happiness I am providing for you;—have you the letter ready, which I injoin'd you to write to him? I'll send a servant with it, to meet him on the way, and give him entire possession of that range of apartments, design'd for him; to shew how absolutely, next to myself, he is master here—'tis a respect, which persons of condition reciprocally challenge.</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SYLVIO.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Syl.</speaker>
<p>A servant from Don <hi>Antonio</hi> is just alighted at the gate, with letters to your lordship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>I cou'd not have receiv'd more welcome

news; admit him. Sister, conduct your lovely friend within. <stage><hi>[Exeunt</hi> Honoria <hi>and</hi> Felicia.</stage> Exquisite, enchanting, mis-judging woman!</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SYLVIO, <hi>with</hi> ERNESTO.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>Sir, Don <hi>Antonio</hi> kisses your hands with this letter.</p>
<stage>[Servants salute.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>I'm glad to find he is in health; yet he seems to think the hour of his arrival uncertain; else I wou'd myself meet, and conduct him hither.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>Tho' the hour is uncertain, signor, yet he will undoubtedly be here to night; for he has appointed the very place, where I am to wait for him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>You are returning thither now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>As soon as I have receiv'd your commands, signor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>I'll answer this forthwith, then give you your whole commission. While I write, make the messenger welcome: <stage><hi>[Exit</hi> Sylvio <hi>with</hi> Ernesto]</stage> I hope nothing will prevent his coming this evening. I grow more and more impatient—there's danger in delay—however <hi>Honoria</hi> may put on a specious complaisance, I know her; her head is quick to contrive, and her heart desperate to execute. Let but <hi>Antonio</hi> come, and she shall not remain unmarried a single hour.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> HONORIA, FELICIA, <hi>and</hi> ROSA.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>You see how arrogant, and absolute he is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Yet his proud heart felt a smart twinge from my keen eyes, just now, or I'm mistaken.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Watch'd like a culprit, commanded like a slave, torn from the man I love, forc'd to a man I have not an idea of!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Od's my life, girl, don't stand enumerating
<pb n="12" facs="18"/>
our distresses, but think how we may remove 'em; we shall mend nothing by complaining; something must be contriv'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>But they come so quick upon us—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>If they come too quick for a woman's invention, they are such as never came before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>I have it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>I knew it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Lend me your veil, cousin; <hi>Rosa,</hi> run and see whether my brother is settled to dispatch <hi>Antonio</hi>'s man.</p>
<stage><hi>[Exit</hi> Rosa.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>What's your scheme? quick.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>If my brother is set down to write, I think I may say an hour is securely mine; for his extravagant suspicion makes him distrust the sense of his own words, and he'll weigh a subscription to a scruple, lest he shou'd degrade his dignity by his style; therefore I'll to <hi>Florio,</hi> let him know the straits to which I am driven, and that all hopes are over, unless he can devise some prompt expedient to relieve us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>But where d'ye think to see him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>At the house where he is conceal'd, 'tis not far off, I'll venture.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>D'ye know the way?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>No, but <hi>Rosa</hi> can conduct me; she has been often there.</p>

<p>Into my chamber—quick.</p>

<hi>Enter</hi> HENRIQUEZ, <hi>with</hi> ERNESTO.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Since you are so desirous, friend, you shall be indulg'd in seeing her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>I shou'd be glad to have it in my power, signor, to tell my master I had that honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Where's your lady, <hi>Rosa?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rosa.</speaker>
<p>In her chamber, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Acquaint her that <hi>Antonio</hi>'s man requests to pay his duty to her, before he goes. <stage><hi>[Exit</hi> Rosa.</stage> Wait here, she will come to you; you will probably find a kinswoman with her, but may distinguish your future mistress, by being in her home-dress without her veil. I will go, and compleat my letter.</p>
<stage><hi>[Exit</hi> Henriquez.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> HONORIA, FELICIA, <hi>and</hi> ROSA.</stage>
<stage>Ernesto <hi>addresses</hi> Felicia.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>I have been bold to request the honour of seeing your ladyship, that I may be more welcome to my lord, at my return.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>An odd mistake!—further it, my dear girl; it may lead to something, no matter what; drowning people catch at straws.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Friend, in what state left you your lord, and mine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>As happy, madam, as the hopes of being your's cou'd make him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>I pray present my service to him, and say, I shall be rejoic'd to hear he has compleated his journey safely, and in health: my good wishes attend him. Friend, farewell.</p>
<stage><hi>[Exeunt</hi> Honoria, Felicia, <hi>and</hi> Rosa.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>Egad, she's a lovely creature; my master will be ravish'd, when he sees her; I begin to
<pb n="14" facs="20"/>
hope this blind bargain, made by proxy, may prove as good, as the old ones made by love; and that those pretty eyes of her's may coax his wits back again, which, I think, he has lost; raving eternally about some unknown damsel, whom he fancies, in his field-errantry, he recover'd from a trance, and he has dreamt of it ever since—I'll go wake him with this good news.</p>
<stage><hi>[Exit</hi> Ern.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> HONORIA, FELICIA, <hi>and</hi> ROSA.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>And yet for the soul of me, notwithstanding our vexations, I cou'd hardly forbear laughing at the formal fool's mistake—Did not I prim myself up with a pretty prudish reserve? Was it like you, cousin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>There's no saying what may be the consequence of the mistake, but it was a lucky thing for me, I'm sure; for I shou'd not have known how to speak for myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rosa.</speaker>
<p>Madam, do we go? What do you resolve?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>That's true; your brother can't be much longer; and if, when he returns, he shou'd miss you from your apartment—I don't think you can venture now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>What's the hour, <hi>Rosa?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rosa.</speaker>
<p>Near eight madam; the clock struck seven, before Donna <hi>Felicia</hi> enter'd the chamber.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>I dare not venture now indeed; run <hi>Rosa,</hi> fetch your veil. <stage><hi>[Exit</hi> Rosa.]</stage> I'll appoint him in my tablets, time and place, where he shall meet me, and <hi>Rosa</hi> shall carry 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>That's well; but where do you design your interview?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>In the remotest part of the garden, which fronts my apartment, you know; where I have often met him, since your absence depriv'd us of the
<pb n="15" facs="21"/>
advantages of your friendly assistance, and the private door to your portion of Don <hi>Juan</hi>'s house; <hi>Rosa</hi> has a key to the back-door of our garden.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>And how cou'd she get that? Not by fair means, I'm sure.<hi>—Henriquez</hi> us'd to be as tenacious of his keys, as of his long-spun pedigree; and even open'd a door himself with as much cautious fear, as if he apprehended a piece of his ancestry shou'd make it's escape at it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p><hi>Rosa</hi> artfully procur'd me an impression of my brother's key one day, when some sudden intelligence hurried him abroad in search of <hi>Florio;</hi> and by that we got one made.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Well contriv'd, my notable girl!</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ROSA, <hi>veil'd.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Shall I beg your patience, while I write?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>This was a lucky accident for you, <hi>Rosa;</hi> you may chance to fee your fond lover <hi>Guzman.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rosa.</speaker>
<p>He is a fond lover of himself, I believe, madam; and without a rival.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Are you sure your words and thoughts agree?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rosa.</speaker>
<p>I'm not so very old to be in my dotage, ma'am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Nor so very young, but you may be in love. Dotage and love are cousin-germans, <hi>Rosa.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rosa.</speaker>
<p>They may, when we encourage a passion, at first sight, madam, and indulge it, without a chance of success;—otherwise, not quite so nearly related.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Pert, and witty enough that! I have provok'd a wasp, and am stung by it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>My dear <hi>Rosa,</hi> make all the haste you are able.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rosa.</speaker>
<p>I'll fly ma'am; has <hi>Florio</hi> the other key of the tablets?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="22"/>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes,—pray dispatch.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rosa.</speaker>
<p>Never doubt me, madam, for all my own fortune is betted on your game.</p>
<stage><hi>[Exit</hi> Rosa.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>There she goes; which is nimblest, her heels, or her tongue, I wonder? Come, my dear girl, try to wear a more chearful aspect; if we are reduc'd to desperate measures, why let the person, who causes it, be blam'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>He justly wou'd deserve it, tho' nothing but the last distress, I think, shou'd urge me to such measures, as the world might censure: yet, were not my affections so strongly pre-engag'd, to a delicate feeling, surely it is no trifling wound, to be oblig'd to give a worthy man a hand, without a heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, hope well—and do not torment your mind any further;—let us retire to your chamber, and, while we wait <hi>Rosa</hi>'s return, I'll try to raise your spirits, with your favourite song.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>My sweet friend, I fear the cold regard, I shall pay, will ill deserve such a kind, and agreeable offer;</p>
<p>In vain we seek relief from outward things,</p>
<p>'Tis from within alone sort quiet springs.</p>

<head>SCENE, <stage>a Market-place.</stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ANTONIO, <hi>and</hi> SANCHO, <hi>in Riding-Suits.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SANCHO.</speaker>
<p>WHAT a confounded pace we have come! but you are always the same, sir. You proceed in the attack of a mistress, with as much vigour, and activity, as you storm a garrison.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Dispatch is the soul of every undertaking: I hate all that savours of coldness, and delay. In a pursuit, so insipidly carried on, the spirits relax, and, tho' you gain your ends, you scarce relish the success.—What do you smile at, <hi>Sancho?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>You expect the truth, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>You know I do. I cannot brook falshood, even in the veriest trifles; lest the mind be insensibly led on to practise it in material affairs, and thereby entail on itself such a reproach, as most disgraces manhood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Why then, sir, I smiled at the oddity of your amours. First, to fall in love with one you hardly ever saw; and then, make such haste to marry one, you never saw. We poor mortals have another method.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Your reflections, like those of the world in general, are too hasty and superficial; not knowing my motives, you wonder at my conduct. How many faultless characters, thro' too severe, and premature conclusions, have had a shade drawn over them, which time, and reason, have, at last, wholly removed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I ask pardon, if I have offended,</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="18" facs="24"/>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>You cannot easily offend. You have gain'd on my temper, and won an indulgence, which your courage and fidelity well deserve.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>But, sir, you are earlier, than you expected, by an hour almost.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>'Tis true.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>Then suppose, sir, you return to the posthouse, and lay aside these unnecessary implements for walking; then, if you please, you may relieve your legs a little more; I can stay in the house, to be ready, when <hi>Ernesto</hi> comes, according to your orders.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I like your counsel well—follow me.</p>

<stage><hi>Enter, from his House,</hi> FLORIO, <hi>with</hi> GUZMAN, <hi>both cloaked.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Come, <hi>Guzman,</hi> now we may venture to quit our dens, take a little fresh air, and begin chace.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>Chace! now the sun is set. Of what, sir? Owls, or bats? Call you this making love?—'Tis much more like making war—marching all night in arms, as if we were going to beat up the enemies quarters, on a forlorn hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Would not you venture as much for <hi>Rosa?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>No, in good faith, sir, I shall venture enough, if I marry her; I'll run no hazards before hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>That's from your fear, not your prudence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>Sir, you may call it what you please, but I dare boldly say, there lives not a more valiant man in the world, than myself, while danger keeps at distance; but when faucily it presses on me,
<pb n="19" facs="25"/>
then, I confess, I have a certain tenderness for life, which checks my ardour, and inclines my prudence to make a timely retreat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>How civil your stile is to yourself!—and how prettily you soften that harsh word, cowardice!—but, I think, I have seen your valour pleas'd to run away, when danger has not been so very pressing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>It may not have appear'd so, sir, to common eyes; but I have such a piercing sight, that I can discover perils at a greater distance than any man in <hi>Spain.—</hi>Other people (poor souls!) not being blessed with such perspicuity, do not descry dangers, time enough to shun 'em, and then their struggling is by the injudicious world called courage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>A man truly valiant will always remain so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>A man wisely valiant will avoid all the danger he can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>You have more light, than heat, I'll allow, <hi>Guzman.</hi> But your humour, and honesty, make amends for your want of courage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>I have courage enough for the profession my parents design'd me for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>What was: that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>A lawyer. I could have put on rare anger in my client's sight, and, when he was gone, have hugged the advocate of the opposite party; and, if I don't mistake, sir, those gentry sell their breath, much dearer than you gentlemen soldiers sell your blood; 'tis true, you get honour—a fine light food, for delicate appetites!—yet I have known some captains of plain stomachs fast upon it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>The knave's right—but how I trifle time! What's this to my embarrassments in love?—How shall I contrive to hear from my <hi>Honoria?—</hi>Shall I venture to my old haunts?—I dare not—To what purpose should I, unless she were pre-advised of
<pb n="20" facs="26"/>
it? This last unhappy accident! left to solitude, and thought—and that loaded with the disagreeable reflection of having shed another's blood!—which (tho' it chanced in self-defence) my reason, and education, will not let me easily digest.—Yet, <hi>Honoria!</hi> she must be mine; and I will leave no peril unencounter'd, to obtain her.—If, after all, I fail—if I must lose her, at least, I will deserve her.</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ANTONIO, <hi>and</hi> SANCHO.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I am tired with waiting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>He cannot be long now, sir, surely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I'll take another minute's turn—go you back to the inn, and wait me there— <stage><hi>[Exit</hi> San.]</stage> I scarce can tell the name of any place, I see. 'Tis so long, since I was in this city, I have lost all my measures of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Do my eyes cheat me, or is that my comrade, when I first bore arms? My friend <hi>Antonio?</hi> If it be he, as sure it must, I cannot dread to know him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p><hi>Florio!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>My honour'd friend!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>You were too long in recollecting me—Your friendship cannot cool?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Never—but your presence here, so unexpected, made me disbelieve my sight.—When came you to town?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I just now arrived.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>I rejoice to see you; but should have thought it more likely to hear of you at court, pursuing the recompence due to your deserts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>An employment I am neither fond, nor capable of. I cannot sue, even for my right. 'Tis my-ambition to merit, but not solicit reward. The dignity of honour suffers in it. If praise, and advancement, do not follow our services, we
<pb n="21" facs="27"/>
must learn to pay ourselves, by a noble contempt of worldly favours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>A severe rule indeed, which virtue prescribes to herself!—to be so backward in claiming a reward, she is so eager to deserve.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>By no means. She is more hurt in being reduced to beg reward, than she can be in the want of it—Besides, a true subject hazards his life in the service of his king and country, for the advancement of their honour and interest solely; he, who does it with a view to his own, deserves neither praise, nor reward.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>The same great, and generous spirit, as ever. I honour the day, which introduced me to the knowledge of so much worth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>What merit I have, I can but faintly call my own—I inherit it from a father, whose example of courage, and integrity, it had been scandalous in a son not to have imitated.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>This is my house, at present, <hi>Antonio—</hi>Will you honour it, by calling it your's? Tho' you must excuse many deficiencies in your entertainment. I am but in an ill condition, at present, to receive the honour of such a guest; having, by an unhappy accident, been obliged, lately, to change my usual place of residence, and keep myself concealed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Concealed!—but that is for a future hour, and more suitable place.—I must however decline your kind offer a while, being forced to remain hereabouts, lest I should miss the return of one, whom I sent to my brother-in-law's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>You surprize me—Have you a brother-in-law in <hi>Seville?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I have. I came hither a married man, as far as friends could make me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Since then it so imports you not to miss your servant, I will keep you company here, 'till
<pb n="22" facs="28"/>
his arrival; then lead you to some refreshment.—You have had a tedious and perilous campaign in <hi>Flanders.—</hi>I long, methinks, <hi>Antonio,</hi> to hear some account of your actions therein, of which fame speaks loudly, but not distinctly.—Could you not oblige me, while you are waiting for your servant—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Excuse me—I cannot—if there be any merit in my behaviour, my own breath would fully it—if not, the report is not fit for a friend's ear.—But if you chuse to fill up the time, I'll give you an adventure of mine, which, I fancy, will repay your attention.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>You will oblige me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>And, when 'tis finished, you will wonder how, with such a prepossession in my heart, I should be induced to come here, to marry a stranger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Your preface awakes my curiosity—to the story, I beseech you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>On the evening, following that glorious day, whereon the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> gain'd such distinguish'd reputation, I was dispatch'd with some horse, to cover the <hi>Limbourg</hi> frontiers, which were too much exposed to the enemy's inroads.—We were scarce arrived, when I receiv'd intelligence, that a party of them (about 200 cavalry) were newly lodged in a village, three leagues off. We instantly sounded to horse, and, not to trouble you with particulars, so great was our expedition, that, by day-break, their quarters were on fire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>You experienced the utility of your own maxim, that diligence in execution is the mistress of success.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Our foes made but faint resistance—some were slain,—some fled to give alarm to their reserves in quarters remote.—The tumult nigh over. I hasted to a lofty structure, supposing it
<pb n="23" facs="29"/>
was their leader's quarter—with intention to preserve him from the soldier's rage, and his building from the fire—but what was my surprize, when, entering a pavilion in the garden, I beheld a woman of a matchless form stretched on the marble floor!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Your heart suffered then, I am sure—Pity and bravery always dwell together.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I felt, what I cannot describe—tho', at first, I believ'd her dead, yet her appearance inspir'd me with such awe, and reverence, that I could not, without trembling, venture to approach her.—I knelt, and raised her in my arms, when strait a sigh stole from her. I knew it not for a sound of grief, while it was a sign of life. At last, she open'd her lovely eyes, and beam'd such looks (spite of her sad situation) as I had ne'er experienced. Awhile I was held mute with wonder, and delight, when a poniard fell from her fair hand—as if she only wanted arms asleep, and waking trusted to her eyes.—My sensations encreased each moment;—when I recover'd power to speak, I said—I know not what—It was all extasy, yet it had its rise in sincerity.—She endeavour'd to reply, but could not—yet she looked such sweet surprize—such gratitude—tho' mixed with fear—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>I am all impatience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I renewed my ardent professions—offer'd my life for the recovery of her's—I labour'd to know her story—The crimson in her cheeks seemed reviving, and her speech returning, when a sudden loud blast of trumpets, and outcry of my men, alarmed me. They were charged with squadrons of fresh horse, whom the fugitives had called from neigbouring villages. I longed to stay with her—I panted to be with them—my powers, for a time, were suspended—but awaking
<pb n="24" facs="30"/>
to that sense of honour, from which no claim should alienate a soldier, I tore myself away. The situation of my mind added to my usual heat—I was desperate in fight, and sustained so many wounds, that I swooned with loss of blood, while my soldiers compleated the victory, and brought me off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>I feel for you in all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>My outward wounds were slight, and quickly healed; but those within, deep, and still sorely bleeding. My heart, and happiness seem'd utterly to have forsaken me. My enquiries after her were vain, and I returned to my post in the army, loaded with the despair of ever seeing her again, from whom my affections can never stray.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>You have, indeed, given me cause for concern, as well as wonder.—So engaged, how comes this strange marriage? From what inducements? Your mind is above the general temptations of the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>From duty, gratitude, and justice—Long before this event, I was contracted to the lady, whom I now come to marry, by the Marquis <hi>D'Oliverc,</hi> whose patronage and friendship, from my infancy, would render my disobedience to a recommendation of his highly improper.—Besides, when he first proposed this match, my heart was wholly disengaged—now there is no retracting.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>A strange, and perplexing adventure truly!—yet may I not ask who the lady is in <hi>Seville,</hi> that is destined to call so much merit her's?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>To you I have no reserve—she is the sister of—</p>

<p>I have delivered your letter, sir, into your brother-in-law's own hands—He seemed concerned at the uncertainty of your time of arriving; which I, in some measure, removed, assuring him, you would undoubtedly see him this night. He kisses your hands, and expects you with impatience. This letter contains his full meaning—As to your bride, sir—the most accomplish'd creature!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>You have seen her then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>My being of your train gave me the privilege of a domestick, to see her in her chamberdress, without a veil; which, o'my conscience, I think, could only be contrived to cover faults, or hide beauties.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Is she so handsome?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>I never saw such another, sir—such a shape! such eyes!—your <hi>Brussels-</hi>beauties, that you used to brag of so, are nothing to her.—Fortune shall chuse me a wife—I'll have no concern with love, or judgment.—But I'll say no more, sir.—Only see her—This master-key, sir, delivered by your brother with great dignity, you are desir'd to receive, as an earnest of that interest and authority, with which you are invested in the family, on the intended alliance. It commands all the apartments prepar'd for your reception—a seperate quarter, that opens on <hi>St. Vincent</hi>'s street—nobly furnished indeed!</p>
</sp>

<p>Ay, I was sure it was some disaster, it came so hastily and unsought for. Some command from our heroine—I'll be hanged, if it don't end in fighting. My mind's prophetic in these matters—People of their rank generally make love by wrote, and it never fails to end in mischief. Those little black books raise more devils, and destruction, than all the conjurer's circles in the universe—Curse o'the inventer of that damn'd artifice of painting words, and talking to our eyes!—If I were to have a hundred daughters, not one of them should ever learn to read or write.—'Tis a quick dispatch, for here she comes again.</p>

<p>At any time, but this—Your business here in <hi>Seville</hi> was to seek happiness, not misery. I cannot bear to be your obstacle—Leave me, my friend, I beg.</p>

<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Enough—I see the exigence—Obey your mistress's injunction—You cannot want that friend, while I am near.—Wrong me not, <hi>Florio,</hi> by another refusal.—I will partake your difficulties, or here ends an intercourse, which friendship has sanctified for years.</p>

<p>for stars, on this occasion, wou'd not much befriend us—My dear <hi>Honoria,</hi> rouze yourself; don't flinch, now you are come to the field of action: such schemes as these are the only means a woman has to shew her spirit; and, on my conscience, I verily believe 'tis only the want of opportunity to shew ourselves, that makes the foolish world charge us with want of courage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>You will be careful then, my sweet girl; you, and <hi>Rosa,</hi> will watch very narrowly above; for if my hot-brain'd brother should surprize us—</p>

<p>Heaven knows, ma'am; they may be all kill'd; when we return'd to the summer-house, all was silent; not a soul there. She's lost, at best.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Ay, then my disgrace is certain, 'tis publick, and perpetual infamy is my portion.—This the reward for all my cares!—my incessant torments!—daily cautions!—hourly admonitions! A man had better have to rule beasts of prey, than women—they have not half their designs—their cruelty—ingratitude! She hath buried my heart in sorrow, and engraven dishonour on the tomb of her ancestors.—She stole away!—her accomplices escaped!—and no means of revenge to be found! Oh! that creatures, which are but feathers in the scale of our enjoyments, shou'd add such weight to our anxieties and torments!</p>

</sp>

<p>I have harbour'd the whole gang.</p>

<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>How—Where?—gratify me, quick——</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>I soon discover'd some, whom I suspected to be the villains; but unable singly to attack 'em, I kept a little distance, to observe which way they took, when one of their party, who was behind the rest, confirm'd me in my suspicions; mistaking me for one of his own crew, he bade me come on, saying his master was but just before—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Good! good!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>We had not pass'd above two streets, before he stopp'd; and at the second house beyond the church in <hi>St. Jago</hi>'s street, he enter'd, and bid me follow—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rosa.</speaker>
<p>The house, where Don <hi>Florio</hi> is conceal'd, madam.</p>
<stage>[Behind.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>I stopping to observe it well, he grew aware of having spoke to a stranger, ran into the house, and lock'd the door. I notic'd it particularly, and can't miss it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Then, ere this possibly they have escaped.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>That is not likely; Where else can they take refuge, at this time of night, in <hi>Seville?</hi> No—no—we have them safe, I'll engage.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>You have given me new life; let me but enjoy my revenge, and, tho' the next moment were my last, I cou'd die contented. Call all my servants—I will besiege that impious dwelling; I'll reduce that theatre of my disgrace to ashes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>Again in these mad fits! for shame, consult your reason; how wild and impracticable were the attempt, to assail a house at this time of night in a well govern'd city! it would only expose your person and fortune to the rigour of the law, publish your dishonour, and frustrate your revenge for ever.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>And wou'd you have me tamely stay, till these ruffians, who have invaded my house, affronted
<pb n="36" facs="42"/>
my person, and stole my sister, may escape my vengeance?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>Be but rul'd by me, I'll shew you the surest and nearest way to gain it; I'll instantly to the corregidor's, for the aid of his authority, to secure them for the present, and to-morrow give 'em up to the law.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Away—away—Conceive you I will wait such slow decisions? Submit a personal injury to the tame formal law? Oh! no; my honour challenges redress from my own arm.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>Honour consists in reason, and in justice, not in frantick violence—that only is your idol. I pray be calm—reflect—all my design is but to conceal the shame, till we have the villains in our power; which cannot be brought about, by any means, so sure, as by demanding justice against the assaulters of your house and person; trust to my conduct; I'll be speedier than you can think, and bring you satisfaction instantly.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Cou'd you fly, you wou'd move too slow for my desires—Oh! how tedious are the moments measur'd by revenge!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rosa.</speaker>
<stage>[Behind.]</stage>
<p>I'll venture, tho' I perish, ma'am, and give her warning of their designs; I'm sure, she's there,—this house is in such confusion, I can run, without being miss'd.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Yet why? Why am I to be controul'd by other's wills? Why rul'd by other's counsels? Are not my own discretion, and wisdom, sufficient arbitors? I'll after, and, at all events, sacrifice the destroyers of my glory; I'll hunt them out, tho' they were buried in the center; or failing, I will withdraw me from the world. Insulted and expos'd, I cannot submit myself an object of publick

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>There my shames begin—there they strike deep—this circumstance alone was wanting to compleat my infamy—What shall I say? What do? He'll ask me for his wife—can I tell him, she is—Oh! cursed woman! where shall I find a heart, a tongue, a voice, a face—</p>

<p>Your commands, sir—'tis possible, Don <hi>Antonio</hi> may think it long.—</p>

<p>My friend, and his mistress, safely lodg'd, I may now attend to my own engagements. Yet this strange usage perplexes me; suff'ring me to wait thus long, on my first arrival!</p>

<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>I swear, I am amaz'd, sir. 'Tis not above two hours, since I saw a numerous family here, and, to all appearance, well order'd; now the pages bolt out of their doors, then start back into their holes, like rabbits in a warren; the maids too, as we enter'd, were all peeping out of the garret windows, like the upper tier of ordnance in a ship—all disorder! but here comes the servant, you sent in.—</p>

<p>Humph!—are you sure, <hi>Ernesto,</hi> you have not brought me to a wrong house?</p>

<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>If you are sure we are awake, sir, then am I certain this is the very house wherein, this afternoon, I saw and spoke both with Don <hi>Henriquez</hi> and your bride; by the same token, there was a lady with her in a veil; and this identical room is the antechamber to your bride's apartment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Then, what can all this mean? I dare not suppose the Marquis wou'd be so importunate to have me sacrific'd to such a creature, as her own brother is asham'd to shew me.</p>

<speaker>Ern.</speaker>
<p>Don't fear, sir,—you may soon be set right, in that point; for yonder I see her in the inner room, lying on her couch, and reading: tho' her face is turn'd the other way, I'll swear to her shape, and cloaths.</p>

lovely maid, to whom I once presum'd to pay the truest vows of love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>I am, <hi>Antonio,</hi> that very she, whose safety, and whose honour, you made your generous care; and to whom you paid some hasty vows of love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>And is it possible, that fortune has compleated, what affection began?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>I cannot but acknowledge she has been peculiarly propitious to you; and I shou'd make an ill return to those vows, did I not congratulate you on the blind Goddess's amazing bounty, that has given you, in the wife to whom you have engag'd yourself, the only woman you can love.</p>

<p>No doubt my conduct may seem strange, yet hear me speak—</p>

<p>By my hopes of future happiness, I vow, that, long ere I beheld those eyes—</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>We have not time for explanations now; a further conference wou'd be improper, till my brother's sanction has allow'd our interview.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Leave me not, dearest lady, in this uncertainty—give me the smallest hope, that you have ever thought your servant worthy a remembrance; then, if I cannot justify myself, discard, despise me utterly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Esteem, that springs from gratitude, cannot easily decay—let that suffice; and, if you are the same <hi>Antonio,</hi> generous, and noble, as you first shew'd to me, when in my distress'd situation—But how am I transgressing? <hi>Honoria</hi> must act, as becomes Don <hi>Henriquez</hi>'s sister; in his absence, longer discourse wou'd be improper; our next meeting may be less restrain'd.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I have, and with such full delight, that I think all the pains and toils of my past life exquisitely rewarded in those few moments of her conversation; I wish'd them to be prolong'd, but her discretion wou'd not suffer too long a visit, in your absence: and I cou'd not but adore the prudence, that robb'd me of such transcendant pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>I am more and more confounded. <stage>[Aside.]</stage> She might have spar'd that caution, sir, since with you—she knew my sentiments—wou'd I cou'd get him away! <stage>[Aside.]</stage> Shall I have the pleasure to conduct you to your chamber? I fear 'tis late, and you want rest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I cou'd not think of troubling you, nor indeed any one, at present, being oblig'd, late as it is, to see a friend, before I go to rest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Shall I attend you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>By no means—I must not suffer it; I'll return in an hour, at farthest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Take your own time; you're wholly master here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I thank you sir—adieu! [I never saw a man so discompos'd, whatever the matter is<hi>—Ernesto,</hi> bid <hi>Sancho</hi> attend me out, and stay you in my apartment till I return.]</p>
<stage>[Aside.]</stage>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>How am I to interpret all this? One mystery breeds another; so delighted with her conversation, so enamour'd of her form! he seem'd in earnest;—and then to make such a sudden sally abroad, after a long journey too, in a place where I shou'd suppose him an utter stranger, and not suffer me to accompany him—but I'll bear no more suspence; I'll to my sister's chamber, and unriddle the whole.</p>

<p>Why, sir, is it my fault, that I am not a cat? How could I tell, in the dark, whether that rascal was a knight errant, or a knight recreant? I took him for a friend.

<p>To convey you safely hence is my only care; my own danger I regard not. I will myself conduct you to some shelter from his barbarous temper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>You should not, for the world. Think what would be the consequence, should you be found by the officers of justice; that would compleat our calamities.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Run, rascal, and fetch a chair immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>A pretty errand at this time of night! those rogues of chairmen are mighty good-natur'd; they're likely to obey a servant's orders, after eleven o'clock.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>But then, to hazard you alone!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>The danger in that is not half so terrifying, as being found here;—admit there were no cause to fear the sad effects of cruelty, and revenge, yet being seen in your house would be interpreted into all that calumny could invent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Tho' the complexion of your brother's malice were as black as hell, it could not cast a stain on innocence like your's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Alas! my <hi>Florio,</hi> the unhappy are always in the wrong, and slander, once propagated, never dies. Why did I leave my brother's house? Why engage your love and tenderness in an adventure, that may prove your ruin?</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>As much aversion as I have, madam, to throwing myself in harm's way, yet I am really so concern'd at the mistake I have made, that I almost wish I had endur'd a few blows, rather than have brought such a distress upon you—</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>He went out but just before you came in, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Madam, I could not think of seeking rest, till I had return'd to inform myself of your's, and my noble friend's state of mind; and to offer my future services, whenever you require them.</p>

<p>Heav'ns, <hi>Rosa,</hi> you here!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>It's a mercy, I am here, madam—for, thro' fear of being traced, and my intelligence prevented, I have taken so many strange, round-about turnings and windings, I almost lost myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>But what disaster brings you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>A terrible one, madam,—you're found out, and pursued—Don <hi>Juan,</hi> by the help of the moon, and a mistake of some of your party, trac'd you to this house, and, in my hearing, informed your
<pb n="47" facs="53"/>
brother of the whole; who is coming with the corregidor and officers, to seize all that shall be found within these walls.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>O unfortunate!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>Away madam, or you're caught.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>What a torrent of woes am I plung'd in! my brother's cruel fury has, I doubt not, asperfed my name with infamy, ne'er to be wiped out.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Let the consciousness of your innocence make you bold, and defy worldly censures.—While your own heart approves, you're safe.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>They'll be upon you, before you are aware, madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>That <hi>Florio</hi> should be absent!—and yet to wait his return—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ros.</speaker>
<p>Would be madness, madam—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Dare you venture yourself with me, madam? Upon my honour, I'll protect you, or perish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>My sad situation, sir, obliges me to trouble you, and your late conduct gives me confidence. With gratitude, I accept your offer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I am the obliged, madam. <hi>Guzman,</hi> go seek your master, and tell him the danger not allowing us to wait, I will convey his mistress to a nunnery. <stage><hi>[Exit</hi> Guz.]</stage> Within religious walls she must be secure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>And stay you, <hi>Rosa,</hi> to bring me word of his resolves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Hold! On recollection, they will not open the monastery gates, at this hour, without a strict enquiry, and that would equally betray us.—I have it—the happiest thought! I will convey you, madam, to my brother-in-law's. His quality and honour will be a sanction to you, and my wife will with pleasure pay the offices due to your virtue, and distress. The liberty, I take herein, I am confident they will approve and thank me for. <hi>Sancho,</hi> stay here, represent all this to <hi>Florio,</hi> and
<pb n="48" facs="54"/>
conduct him with the utmost caution and secresy to my apartment; happily I have the key<hi>—Ernesto</hi> sits up for me, so I shan't want it; and, for <hi>Florio</hi>'s better security, tell him, 'tis my counsel that he comes in a chair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Continue here, dear <hi>Rosa,</hi> till you are assured what steps <hi>Florio</hi> takes; then return home, where I will find some means to send for intelligence. To what arts am I reduc'd by my distresses!</p>

<p>Upon my soul, a very gallant compliment my master makes to your lady and her lover, to quit his brother-in-law's, and leave so sweet a bride as <hi>Honoria,</hi> alone!—</p>

<sp>

<p>What, is his mistress's name <hi>Honoria,</hi> too?</p>

<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>Nor I can't find him—A pretty pickle we are in!—Oons, methinks a man, who has but one grain of wit, wou'd never serve a lover; he had better serve a mountebank, and be run through the body twice a week, to recommend his balsam.—Our masters and mistresses have very prudently sneaked off, and left us to pay the reckoning—Ay, 'tis the same in all times and all places—so spoke the <hi>English</hi> poet—</p>
<l>Thus little villains must submit to fate,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Villain, leave fooling.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guz.</speaker>
<p>There's none in the case, sir—She never did wiser—had she staid your return, she had fallen into those clutches which will immediately gripe you, if you don't make off; <hi>Rosa</hi> has ran, till she had little breath left, to tell you the corregidor and alguazils are coming to apprehend all in this house—so save yourself, sir—she's safe enough<hi>—Antonio</hi> has taken her to a nunnery.</p>

<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>A nunnery, slave!—there she's lost to me for ever—When once they are inform'd of these transactions—</p>

<p>Be pacified, sir, it was so design'd, at first.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>San.</speaker>
<p>But mym aster has convey'd her, sir, to his brother-in-law's, whose credit and quality are so eminent, that the engaging him in your mutual protection, he doubts not, will much avail you—My master's bride, too, will assist to comfort her—I was ordered to wait o'purpose to inform you this; and if you will venture to follow them, to assure you, you may depend on a protection there also. I have the key of my master's apartments to conduct you privately; and he intreats you will go in a chair, to avoid being question'd, in case of any encounter by the way.</p>

My <hi>Florio</hi> cou'd not mean—Oh, no, let me not think it—but that this man, who look'd like truth itself! to whom my <hi>Florio</hi> thought he could entrust his happiness and life—that he should be so base, to throw me into that danger it was my only care to shun!—All's over now—Struggling and hope alike are vain, and all my future life is misery.</p>

<p>O Heaven's!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>This is the man, to whom you are contracted; and, to aggravate our perplexities, the very hero, who preserv'd my life, and honour; tho', I begin to fear, at the expence of my happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>His behaviour, and motives, then are well explain'd—The man, to whom I was engag'd, has been a witness to my concealment, my shame—my passion for another—and he has used this means
<pb n="55" facs="61"/>
to bring me to my abandon'd home, that he and my unnatural brother, may wreak their cruel vengeance on me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>I am all amazement—How came you into his hands?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>My <hi>Florio,</hi> to whom he proves an intimate friend, entrusted me to his care; tho' till this moment, I never heard his name;—that might have alarm'd me—but every slightest circumstance concurs to ruin me.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>But were you distracted, to let him bring you here, or blind, not to know your own house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>How could I in such darkness, such fear, such confusion? beside, he brought me in the back way, thro' his own quarter, and had the lights put out, before he introduc'd me—Well, I am prepar'd to suffer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Not in such haste, my dear girl—while there is life there is hope—I'll struggle to the last moment—Don't you remember the mistake <hi>Antonio</hi>'s servant made this afternoon?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p><hi>Antonio'</hi> has done the same, in your absence; and, on your account, I did not disabuse him. He has renew'd his vows of love with equal ardour, as when he first saw me, and seem'd transported to discover his destin'd wife in the woman whom he rescued. There hangs your hope, and mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Vain suggestion! What hope can we have, while this cruel contract remains such a bar to our general happiness?—Besides, he has seen my brother by this time—the whole is out—and ruin certain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Not so very certain, as you apprehend. <hi>Antonio</hi>'s friendship to <hi>Florio,</hi> which induc'd him to-protect you, may yet—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Friendship! dear <hi>Felicia,</hi> will that remain unshaken?—will that stand up against these strange

events?—against the affront done to his honour? Oh! no—He is not what he was,—his mind, his principles are changed, and I am made the victim to his wrath—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p><hi>Antonio</hi> change! It is impossible. Tho' all felicity this world affords should bribe him, it could not tempt him to recede from his pledg'd faith, and honour.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>I forgot her interest in him.—Pardon me, my dear <hi>Felicia.</hi> I scarce know what I say. My mind is wounded by the variety of my afflictions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>My lovely girl!—excuse my warmth—but I must repeat my assertions—If we have yet a chance for happiness, 'tis founded in his steadiness and truth—The more I contemplate it, the more do my spirits and hopes revive. If you cou'd secure yourself from your brother, this night only, what between my hero and brother—</p>

<p>How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>By the secret door, thro' which you have so often pass'd, to meet your <hi>Florio—</hi>when last we used it, it was fatal; now it may be fortunate. Once escaped, get my brother's assent for this night's concealment, and ask his further advice, and assistance. I'll answer for him; he is generous, and kind—My lover brave and wise—dry your eyes; O'my credit, you shall not weep, till you have more occasion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>He's here again, cousin.</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Undeceive him!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Yes—such a confidence, I am sure, must rivet him to our interests.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>For heaven's sake, be cautious. I yet have doubts of his conduct.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="57" facs="63"/>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>I have none. Our hopes in him will be made certainties hereby.</p>

<p>Not yet return'd!—A guest in his house too, that's come so far on such a business! something I can't comprehend—I have not yet been able, madam, to find your brother; but think it can't be long e'er he returns; then I'll inform him of the accident, which has made his house this lady's sanctuary.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>I cou'd not wait at the corregidor's, tho' I promised; my impatience to unfold this riddle burns me up—that Don <hi>Antonio</hi> should entertain my sister when I was positive—By heav'n she's there, and <hi>Felicia</hi> with her!—were all my rascals mad, or was it a plot to insult me? and Don <hi>Juan!</hi> was he mad too? to swear he had trac'd her to another house? either I, or they, or all, must be possess'd—Some enchantment reigns here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Here is Don <hi>Henriquez—</hi>now I'll inform him, madam, of your sad story.</p>

<p>In what, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="58" facs="64"/>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Now it comes.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>That I have been the occasion of your finding her here, at this late hour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>I understand you, sir; she is desirous to pass this night, with <hi>Honoria,</hi> and assist her in ordering her nuptial ceremonies.—Ay, in heav'n's name, let her stay.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>Better than I expected. Courage cuz!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>But, sir, the necessity, that induces me to—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Dear sir, can you suppose an apology necessary for <hi>Honoria,</hi> and her kinswoman, passing a night together?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Is she so near a relation of his? 'tis well I told no more of her story.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>She knows, I owe her for many favours, and hope to be able to repay them amply.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>There—can he speak his design much plainer?</p>
<stage><hi>[Aside to</hi> Fel.</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>For that matter, the cap would fit me, as well as you.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Since it is so late, sir, will you give the ladies leave to retire, for the present, to their own chamber? withdraw, <hi>Honoria.—</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>Now <hi>Felicia!—</hi></p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>I don't like this sudden calm—'tis but the fore-runner of another storm; let us fly to shelter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hon.</speaker>
<p>But how, while they remain in the <stage>Aside.</stage> room, thro' which we must pass?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>We must watch their departure—'tis probable, he'll wait on <hi>Antonio</hi> to his apartment, and we may take that opportunity to escape.</p>
<stage>[Exeunt.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I will now go see whether <hi>Sancho</hi> has yet brought <hi>Florio</hi> to my apartment. <stage>Aside.</stage> your pardon, sir, I will but step to my own chamber, and return immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="59" facs="65"/>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Shall I conduct you, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>I know the way, I thank you, sir.—[There's something strange in his words, and behaviour, which indicates disguise and artifice. I must see it expounded.</p>
<stage>[Aside]</stage>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>All the feinds in hell, sure, cou'd not conjure up such another mystery. <hi>Juan</hi> affirms the people, we fought with, had convey'd <hi>Honoria</hi> away—when I come to seek her, at home, she's missing, and her waiting wench tells me she went into the garden, whence no one knows of her return. <hi>Antonio,</hi> just after, protests he saw, and entertain'd her in her own apartment, where I certainly now find her, and that ungrateful woman with her.—These are riddles to pose an Oedipus, and madden a stoick—They must be explain'd, and shall—Yet hold! <hi>Antonio</hi> said he would return forthwith—here will I wait, 'till he arrives; see him safe at rest, and then extort the whole truth from <hi>Honoria.—</hi>Could I but be convinced my honour were yet unstain'd, I should, I think, be somewhat easier. The load might be a little lighter, that's all I'm to expect;</p>
<p>No hope of perfect, or of lasting rest,</p>

<p>Not yet retunr'd! what an irksome situation to a man of my anxious disposition! in momentary expectation of <hi>Antonio,</hi> therefore not daring to enquire into what so intimately concerns my peace and honour; no, I must not attempt an explanation with my sister, 'till the house be quiet, and <hi>Antonio</hi> retir'd to rest.

me ease!—their marriage—'tis one comfort however, that I have her safe now; I have not quitted these apartments; she cannot have made a second garden-excursion—Therefore, till I can settle the whole affair to my wishes, I will endeavour to subdue my temper, controul my feelings, and be no more under the dominion of such passions, as rend my heart.</p>

<sp>

<p>I dread to tell the issue of our search.</p>

<p>You need not, my friend; some favourable circumstances, and a little cool reflection, I trust, have render'd me more temperate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>I shou'd rejoice to prove it: but when you have heard my story, I fear you will relapse.</p>

<p>Cousin, I've said it—I will not—</p>

<p>The corregidor and myself just reach'd the appointed place, time enough for his officers to seize the servants, who were accomplices, when they were just going to convey away in a chair—I cannot speak it—</p>

<p>Cousin, cousin, what motive can you have for endeavouring to impose on me? I tell you positively I found her there, and her waiting-woman <hi>Rosa</hi> with her.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Cousin, cousin, do not persist thus to affirm impossibilities.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Sure you are making some experiment on my temper; are endeavouring to provoke me to one of your own frantick fits, that I may never dare to counsel you again; I swear to you, upon my honour, 'tis not half an hour since I left <hi>Honoria</hi> bearing away in a chair from the house, to which I dogg'd her, and your man <hi>Jaques</hi> leading the way, and guarding <hi>Rosa.</hi></p>

<sp>

<p>It was <hi>Florio,</hi> my comrade in arms, my bosom-friend, whom I design'd to serve; not that disloyal man, who has invaded my honour, and my love.</p>

<p>I'll try to calm them.—Know, Don <hi>Henriquez,</hi> that Don <hi>Florio</hi> has ever been your sister's constant lover, his private visits, at our house, which have disturb'd your peace, were by me calculated for their interview, after you had refus'd her to his addresses;—my heart was then entirely free; 'tis now engag'd:—if I trespass too far on that reserve, which is our sex's ornament, and guard, let the present exigence, and my gratitude for signal services, plead my excuse, while I declare, it is to that brave officer.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="75" facs="81"/>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Humph!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>This, brother, is that generous commander, whose valiant arm restor'd our liberties, and who engag'd himself the guardian of my honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>This that gallant leader, to whom we are so much indebted?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>Why did you not inform me sooner of so laudable a prepossession?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>My dear brother, gratitude, esteem, and a thousand nameless passions, so soon possess'd me, I was asham'd of what you might have call'd a visionary love, and durst not trust my own tongue with my thoughts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Your sister, and this lady, Don <hi>Henriquez,</hi> both can witness I never had a thought to injure your happiness, or honour. Don <hi>Pedro'</hi>s death was occasion'd by your mistaken jealousy; and you well know, (but that your self, and your domesticks, were the only witnesses of that transaction) I had the fairest claim to the protection of the law, having been surpris'd at dis-advantage and oppress'd by numbers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>All.</speaker>
<p>How!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p><hi>Pedro</hi> deserv'd his death, and I am blameless.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>My shame! my eternal shame! what shall I say? you see me overwhelm'd with confusion; if I have acted in a manner unbecoming my name, and honour, attribute it to love—(I seek not longer to conceal it,) a hurt, a desperate, jealous love for that ungrateful creature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>Cousin, I will now own, I have perceiv'd it long; and in justice to our friendship, and alliance, have even address'd my sister on the subject; but found such insurmountable objections to your but
<pb n="76" facs="82"/>
violence of temper, that, in consideration of what your pride might suffer, I conceal'd my knowledge of your passion, even from yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>How cou'd a man of Don <hi>Henriquez'</hi> sense, and penetration, suppose his tyrannic treatment of so amiable a sister, such everlasting doubts, suspicions, jealousies, restrictions, and severities, must not disgust rather than win a woman's heart? Cou'd you but have subdued those passions, perhaps, ere I had seen that gentleman, I might have been induc'd to think of you in such a light, as your person, and natural endowments deserv'd; if a disappointment herein be painful, to your self alone you are indebted for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Forbear, I pray you; shew not the happiness I might have reached, nor add the weight of your reproaches, to my self-condemnation; my punishment is sufficient without it;—I have justly railed; when such a heart as mine concedes, the pangs it suffers are not trivial.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fel.</speaker>
<p>I am sorry, and ask pardon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>Yet to convince you that my sorrow is not selfish; as I have been the source of general uneasiness, I will endeavour to make a general amends, let my own heart suffer what it may: first madam, may you enjoy more happiness, if possible, than I have wish'd to partake with you; and, sir, to you, unask'd I thus resign this contract, which love and justice both forbid me now to claim,</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Noble <hi>Henriquez;</hi> I thank and honour you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Juan.</speaker>
<p>Sir, take from me her hand, whose heart your worth, and bravery has merited.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
<p>Thus I receive the sum of happiness, this world can give; and, sir, since you have generously resign'd the name of brother, allow me that of friend, which while I live I will deserve; and suffer
<pb n="77" facs="83"/>
me to entreat your concurrence for your sister's happiness, where destiny seems to lead;—I will answer, with my life, my friend will merit her.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>This union being in my house, let me entreat your stay, to unite in woad'ring at these events, and enjoying general congratulations; cousin you will not refuse me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<p>I will not be a means to thwart your mirth, but endeavour, as well as I am able, to partake it,—my heart has now a new, a difficult, and painful lesson set it, but it must be learn'd; for our adventures prove that womens mild and gentle hearts must be sooth'd by indulgence, not frighted
<pb n="78" facs="84"/>
by severity; and that easy, frank, and confiding tempers bid fairest for a generous return,</p>
<l>Since such, and such alone, deserve to share</l>
<l>The confidence, and favour of the fair.</l>

<l>Where e'er we go, what e'er we do, or say,</l>
<l>Make it your rule—to give us our own way;</l>
<l>Neither attempt to lead us, nor restrain,</l>
<l>But let us have the length of all the rein;</l>
<l>In shoppings, auctions, jauntings, or Quadrille,</l>
<l>Leave us to spend, and lose what e'er we will;</l>
<l>Let all our fav'rite foibles take their course,</l>
<l>(For every breather has some hobby-horse)</l>
<l><pb facs="86"/>
With whatsoever whims or freaks you meet,</l>
<l>Still let your words and looks alike be sweet—</l>
<l>Lord! when thus left to our own tempers free,</l>
<l>The sweetest creatures in the world are we!—</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Hence this important Maxim is defin'd,</l>
<l>Ye <hi>wise ones,</hi> keep it ever in your mind—</l>
<l>We women never frown, if never teaz'd,</l>
<l>And, always humour'd,—we are always pleas'd.</l>
