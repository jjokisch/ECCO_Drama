<p><seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Wish I could have brought this Play upon the Stage with less Violence to its Author, and not so much Responsibility on my own Part. New characters of necessity require some display. Many original passages of the first merit are still retained, and in the contemplation of them, my errors, I hope, will be overlooked or forgiven; In examining the Brilliancy of a Diamond, few people throw away any Remarks upon the dullness of the foil.</p>

<speaker>POET</speaker>
<l>GOOD day, Sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>I am glad y' are well.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<l>I have not seen you long; how goes the world?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>It wears Sir as it goes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<l>Ay, that's well known.</l>
<l>But what particular rariety? what so strange,</l>
<l>Which manifold record not matches? see!</l>
<stage>Jeweller and Merchant enter; other Suitors pass over the Stage</stage>
<l>Magick of bounty! all these spirits thy power</l>
<l>Hath conjur'd to attend. I know the merchant.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<l>O 'tis a worthy Lord!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jew.</speaker>
<l>Nay, that's most fixt.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<l>A most incomparable man, breath'd as it were</l>
<l>To an untirable and continuate goodness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jew.</speaker>
<l>I have a jewel here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<l>O, pray, let's see't:</l>
<l>For the Lord <hi>Timon,</hi> Sir?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jew.</speaker>
<l>If he will touch the estimate: but for that—</l>
<stage>Exeunt Merchant and Jeweller.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<l> 
<stage>[to himself.]</stage> When we for recompence have praised the vile,</l>
<l>It stains the glory in that happy verse</l>
<l>Which aptly sings the good.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>You're rapt, Sir, in some work, some dedication</l>
<l>To the great Lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<l>A thing slipt idly from me.</l>
<l>Our poesie is a gum, which issues</l>
<l>From whence 'tis nourished.</l>
<l>What have you there?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>A picture, Sir—and when comes your book forth?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<l>Upon the heels of my presentment, Sir.</l>
<l>Let's see your piece.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>'Tis a good piece.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<l>So 'tis,</l>
<l>This comes off well and excellent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>Indiff'rent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<l>Admirable! how this grace</l>
<l>Speaks his own standing? what a mental power</l>
<l>This eye shoots forth? how big imagination</l>
<l>Moves in this lip? to th' dumbness of the gesture</l>
<l>One might interpret.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>It is a pretty mocking of the life:</l>
<l>Here is a touch—is't good?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<l>I'll say of it,</l>
<l>It tutors nature; artificial strife</l>
<l>Lives in those touches, livelier than life.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter certain Senators, and pass on.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>How this Lord is followed!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<l>The Senators of <hi>Athens</hi>! happy man!</l>

<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>Look, more!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<l>You see this confluence, this great flood of visiters.</l>
<l>I have upon a high and pleasant hill</l>
<l>Feign'd <hi>Fortune</hi> to be thron'd. The base o' th' mount</l>
<l>Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,</l>
<l>That labour on the bosom of this sphere</l>
<l>To propagate their states: amongst them all,</l>
<l>Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixt,</l>
<l>One do I personate of <hi>Timon</hi>'s frame,</l>
<l>Whom <hi>Fortune</hi> with her iv'ry hand wafts to her,</l>
<l>Whose present grace to present slaves and servants</l>
<l>Translates his rivals.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>'Tis conceiv'd to th' scope.</l>
<l>This throne, this fortune, and this hill, methinks,</l>
<l>With one man beckon'd from the rest below,</l>
<l>Bowing his head against the steepy mount</l>
<l>To climb his happiness, would be well exprest</l>
<l>In our condition.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poet.</speaker>
<l>Nay. but hear me on:</l>
<l>When <hi>Fortune</hi> in her shift and change of mood</l>
<l>Spurns down her late belov'd, all his dependants,</l>
<l>(Which labour'd after to the mountain's top,</l>
<l>Even on their knees and hands,) let him slip down,</l>
<l>Not one accompanying his declining foot.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pain.</speaker>
<l>'Tis common:</l>
<l>A thousand moral paintings I can shew,</l>
<l>That shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortune</l>
<l>More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well</l>
<l>To shew Lord <hi>Timon,</hi> that mean eyes have seen</l>
<l>The foot above the head.</l>

<l>I am not of that feather to shake off</l>

<l>A gentleman that well deserves a help,</l>

<l>Your Lordship ever binds him.</l>

<l>A piece of painting, which I do beseech</l>
<l>Your Lordship to accept.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tim.</speaker>
<l>Painting is welcome.</l>
<l>The painted is the almost natural man:</l>
<l>For since dishonour trafficks with man's nature,</l>
<l>He is but outside: pencil'd figures are</l>
<l>Ev'n such as they give out. I like your work;</l>
<l>And you shall find I like it: wait attendance</l>

<l>O my good Lord,</l>
<l>At many times I brought in my accompts,</l>

<l>When, for some trifling present, you have bid me</l>
<l>Return so much, I've shook my head, and wept;</l>
<l>Yea, 'gainst th' authority of manners, pray'd you</l>
<l>To hold your hand more close. I did endure</l>
<l>Not seldom, nor no slight checks; when I have</l>
<l>Prompted you in the ebb of your estate,</l>
<l>And your great flow of debts. My dear lov'd Lord,</l>
<l>Though you hear now too late, yet now's a time;</l>

<l>Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.</l>
<l>Go to <hi>Ventiaius</hi>—pr'ythee, be not sad,</l>
<l>Thou'rt true, and just; ingenuously I speak,</l>
<l>No blame belongs to thee: <hi>Ventidius</hi> lately</l>
<l>Bury'd his father, by whose death he's stepp'd</l>
<l>Into a great estate; when he was poor,</l>
<l>Imprison'd, and in scarcity of friends,</l>
<l>I clear'd him with five talents. Greet him from me,</l>
<l>Bid him suppose, some good necessity</l>
<l>Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd</l>
<l>With those five talents. That had, give't these fellows,</l>

<l>That <hi>Timon</hi>'s fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.</l>

<p>Here's my Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucul.</speaker>
<p>One of Lord <hi>Timon</hi>'s men; a gift, I warrant. Why, this hits right: I dreamt of a silver bason and ewre to-night.
<hi>Flaminius,</hi> honest <hi>Flaminius,</hi> you are very respectively welcome, Sir; fill me some wine. And how does that honourable, compleat, free-hearted Gentleman of <hi>Athens,</hi> thy very bountiful good lord and master?</p>

<p>His health is well, Sir.</p>

<p>I am right glad that his health is well, Sir; and what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty <hi>Flaminius?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flam.</speaker>
<p>Faith, nothing but an empty box, Sir, which in my Lord's behalf I come to intreat your Honour to supply; who having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to your Lordship to furnish him, nothing doubting your present assistance therein.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucul.</speaker>
<p>La, la, la, la,—Nothing doubting, says he? alas, good Lord, a noble Gentleman 'tis, if he would not keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha' din'd with him, and told him on't; and came again to supper to him on purpose to have him spend less.<pb n="27" facs="26"/> And yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning by my coming; every man hath his fault, and honesty is his.

<p>Please your Lordship, here is the wine.</p>

<p>Your Lordship speaks your pleasure.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lucul.</speaker>
<p>I have observ'd thee always for a towardly prompt spirit, give thee thy due: and one that knows what belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if the time use thee well. Good parts in thee—Get you gone, sirrah. 
<stage>[To the servant, who goes out.]</stage>—Draw nearer, honest <hi>Flaminius</hi>; thy Lord's a bountiful Gentleman, but thou art wise, and thou knowest well enough (although thou comest to me) that this is no time to lend money, especially upon bare friendship without security. Here's three <hi>Solidares</hi> for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say, thou saw'st me not. Fare thee well.</p>

<l>May these add to the number that may scald thee:</l>

<l>Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!</l>
<l>Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,</l>
<l>It turns in less than two nights? O you gods!</l>
<l>I feel my master's passion. This slave</l>
