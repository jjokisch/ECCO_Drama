<head>To the Right Honourable CHARLES Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's Houshold, and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, &amp;c.</head>
<opener><salute>MY LORD,</salute></opener>
<p>A Young Poet is liable to the same Vanity and Indiscretion with a Young Lover; and the Great Man that smiles upon one, and the Fine Woman that looks kindly upon t'other, are each of 'em in Danger of having the Favour publish'd with the first Opportunity.</p>
<p>But there may be a different Motive, which will a little distinguish the Offenders. For tho' one should have a Vanity in ruining another's Reputation, yet the other may only have an Ambition to advance his own. And I beg leave, my Lord, that I may plead the latter, both as the Cause and Excuse of this Dedication.</p>
<p>Whoever is King, is also the Father of his Country; and as no Body can dispute Your Lordship's <hi>Monarchy</hi> in <hi>Poetry;</hi> so all that are concern'd, ought to acknowledge Your Universal Patronage: And it is only presuming on the Privilege of a Loyal Subject, that I have ventur'd to make this my Address of Thanks to your Lordship, which at the same time includes a Prayer for Your Protection.</p>
<p>I am not Ignorant of the Common Form of Poetical Dedications, which are generally made up of Panegyricks, where the Authors endeavour to distinguish their Patrons, by the shining Characters they give them above other Men. But that, my Lord, is not my Business at this time, nor is Your Lordship <hi>now</hi> to be distinguish'd. I am contented
<pb facs="4"/>
with the Honour I do my self in this Epistle, without the Vanity of attempting to add to, or explain Your Lordship's Character.</p>
<p>I confess it is not without some struggling, that I behave my self in this Case as I ought: For it is very hard to be pleased with a Subject, and yet forbear it. But I chuse rather to follow <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Precept, than his Example, when in his Panegyrick to the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> he says,
<l>Nec minus considerabo quid aures ejus pati</l>
<l>possint, Quam quid virtutibus debeatur.</l></p>
<p>I hope I may be excus'd the Pedantry of a Quotation, when it is so justly apply'd. Here are some Lines in the Print, (and which Your Lordship read before this Play was Acted) that were omitted on the Stage; and particularly one whole Scene in the Third Act, which not only helps the Design forward with less Precipitation, but also heightens the ridiculous Character of <hi>Foresight,</hi> which indeed seems to be maim'd without it. But I found my self in great Danger of a long Play, and was glad to help it where I could. Tho' notwithstanding my Care, and the kind Reception it had from the Town, I could heartily wish it yet shorter: But the Number of different Characters represented in it, would have been too much crowded in less room.</p>
<p>This Reflection on Prolixity, (a Fault for which scarce any one Beauty will attone) warns me not to be tedious now, and detain Your Lordship any longer with the Trifles of,</p>
<closer><salute>MY LORD,</salute> <signed>Your Lordship's most Obedient, and most Humble Servant, William Congreve.</signed></closer>

<head>A PROLOGUE FOR The Opening of the New Play-House, 
<stage>propos'd to be spoken by Mrs. <hi>Bracegirdle</hi> in Man's Cloaths.</stage></head>
<byline>Sent from an unknown Hand.</byline>
<l>CUstom, which every where bears mighty Sway,</l>
<l>Brings me to Act the Orator to Day:</l>
<l>But Women, you will say, are ill at Speeches,</l>
<l>'Tis true, and therefore I appear in Breeches:</l>
<l>Not for Example to you City-Wives,</l>
<l>That by Prescription's settled for your Lives.</l>
<l>Was it for Gain the Husband first consented?</l>
<l>O yes, their Gains are mightily augmented:</l>
<stage>Making Horns with her Hands over her Head.</stage>
<l>And yet, methinks, it must have cost some Strife:</l>
<l>A Passive Husband, and an Active Wife!</l>
<l>'Tis aukward, very aukward, by my Life.</l>
<l>But to my Speech. Assemblies of all Nations</l>
<l>Still are suppos'd to open with Orations:</l>
<l>Mine shall begin, to shew our Obligations.</l>
<l>To you, our Benefactors, lowly Bowing,</l>
<l>Whose Favours have prevented our Undoing;</l>
<l>A long <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage we endur'd,</l>
<l>'Till Freedom, by your Justice, we procur'd:</l>
<l>Our Taskmasters were grown such very Jews,</l>
<l>We must at length have Play'd in Wooden Shoos,</l>
<l>Had not your Bounty taught us to refuse.</l>
<l><pb facs="6"/>
Freedom's of <hi>English</hi> Growth, I think, alone;</l>
<l>What for lost <hi>English</hi> Freedom can attone?</l>
<l>A Free-born Player loaths to be compell'd;</l>
<l>Our Rulers Tyranniz'd, and We Rebell'd.</l>
<l>Freedom! the Wise Man's Wish, the Poor Man's Wealth;</l>
<l>Which you, and I, and most of us enjoy by Stealth;</l>
<l>The Soul of Pleasure, and the Sweet of Life,</l>
<l>The Woman's Charter, Widow, Maid or Wife,</l>
<l>This they'd have cancell'd, and thence grew the Strife.</l>
<l>But you, perhaps, wou'd have me here confess</l>
<l>How we obtain'd the Favour;—Can't you guess?</l>
<l>Why then I'll tell you, (for I hate a Lie)</l>
<l>By Brib'ry, errant Brib'ry, let me die:</l>
<l>I was their Agent, but by <hi>Jove</hi> I swear</l>
<l>No honourable Member had a share,</l>
<l>Tho' young and able Members bid me Fair:</l>
<l>I chose a wiser way to make you willing,</l>
<l>Which has not cost the House a single Shilling;</l>
<l>Now you suspect at least I went a Billing.</l>
<l>You see I'm Young, and to that Air of Youth,</l>
<l>Some will add Beauty, and a little Truth;</l>
<l>These pow'rful Charms, improv'd by pow'rful Arts,</l>
<l>Prevail'd to captivate your op'ning Hearts.</l>
<l>Thus furnish'd, I preferr'd my poor Petition,</l>
<l>And brib'd ye to commiserate our Condition:</l>
<l>I laugh'd, and sigh'd, and sung, and leer'd upon ye,</l>
<l>With roguish loving Looks, and that way won ye:</l>
<l>The Young Men kiss'd me, and the Old I kiss'd,</l>
<l>And luringly I led them as I list.</l>
<l>The Ladies in meer Pity took our Parts,</l>
<l>Pity's the Darling Passion of their Hearts.</l>
<l>Thus Bribing, or thus Brib'd, fear no Disgraces;</l>
<l>For thus you may take Bribes, and keep your Places.</l>

<head>PROLOGUE. 
<stage>Spoken at the Opening of the New House, By Mr. <hi>Betterton.</hi></stage></head>
<l>THE Husbandman in vain renews his Toil,</l>
<l>To cultivate each Tear a hungry Soil;</l>
<l>And fondly hopes for rich and generous Fruit,</l>
<l>When what shou'd feed the Tree, devours the Root:</l>
<l>Th' unlanden Boughs, he sees, bode certain Dearth,</l>
<l>Unless transplanted to more kindly Earth.</l>
<l>So the poor Husbands of the Stage, who found</l>
<l>Their Labours lost upon th' ungrateful Ground,</l>
<l>This last and only Remedy have prov'd;</l>
<l>And hope new Fruit from ancient Stocks remov'd.</l>
<l>Well may they hope, when you so kindly aid,</l>
<l>And plant a Soil which you so rich have made.</l>
<l>As Nature gave the World to Man's first Age,</l>
<l>So from your Bounty we receive this Stage;</l>
<l>The Freedom Man was born to you've restor'd,</l>
<l>And to our World such Plenty you afford,</l>
<l>It seems like <hi>Eden,</hi> fruitful of its own Accord.</l>
<l>But since in <hi>Paradise</hi> frail Flesh gave way,</l>
<l>And when but two were made, both went astray;</l>
<l>Forbear your Wonder, and the Fault forgive,</l>
<l>If in our larger Family we grieve</l>
<l>One falling <hi>Adam,</hi> and one tempted <hi>Eve.</hi></l>
<l>We who remain, would gratefully repay</l>
<l>What our Endeavours can, and bring this Day,</l>
<l>The First-fruit Off'ring of a Virgin Play.</l>
<l>We hope there's something that may please each Taste,</l>
<l>And tho' of homely Fare we make the Feast,</l>
<l>Yet you will find Variety at least.</l>
<l><pb facs="8"/>
There's Humour, which for chearful Friends we got;</l>
<l>And for the thinking Party there's a Plot.</l>
<l>We've something too to gratifie ill Nature,</l>
<l>(If there be any here) and that is Satire.</l>
<l>Tho' Satire scarce dares grin, 'tis grown so mild;</l>
<l>Or only shews its Teeth, as if it smil'd.</l>
<l>As Asses Thistles, Poets mumble Wit;</l>
<l>And dare not bite, for fear of being bit.</l>
<l>They hold their Pens, as Swords are held by Fools,</l>
<l>And are afraid to use their own Edge-Tools.</l>
<l>Since the <hi>Plain-Dealer</hi>'s Scenes of Manly Rage,</l>
<l>Not one has dar'd to lash this Crying Age.</l>
<l>This time, the Poet owns the bold Essay,</l>
<l>Yet hopes there's no ill Manners in his Play:</l>
<l>And he declares by me, he has design'd</l>
<l>Affront to none, but frankly speaks his Mind.</l>
<l>And shou'd th' ensuing Scenes not chance to hit,</l>
<l>He offers but this one Excuse, 'Twas writ</l>
<l>Before your late Encouragement of Wit.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE, 
<stage>Spoken at the Opening of the New House. By Mrs. <hi>Bracegirdle.</hi></stage></head>
<l>SURE Providence, at first, design'd this Place</l>
<l>To be the Player's Refuge in Distress;</l>
<l>For still in every Storm they all run hither,</l>
<l>As to a Shed, that shields 'em from the Weather.</l>
<l>But thinking of this Change which last befel us,</l>
<l>It's like what I have heard our Poets tell us:</l>
<l>For when behind our Scenes their Suits are pleading,</l>
<l>To help their Love, sometimes they show their Reading;</l>
<l>And wanting ready Cash to pay for Hearts,</l>
<l>They top their Learning on us, and their Parts.</l>
<l>Once of Philosophers they told us Stories,</l>
<l>Whom, as I think, they call'd<hi>—Py—Pythagories.</hi></l>
<l>I'm sure 'tis some such <hi>Latin</hi> Name they give 'em,</l>
<l>And we, who know no better, must believe 'em.</l>
<l>Now to these Men (say they) such Souls were given,</l>
<l>That after Death ne'er went to Hell nor Heaven,</l>
<l>But liv'd, I know not how, in Beasts; and then,</l>
<l>When many Years were past, in Men again.</l>
<l>Methinks, we <hi>Players</hi> resemble such a Soul,</l>
<l>That does from Bodies, we from Houses stroll.</l>
<l>Thus <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Soul, of old that was,</l>
<l>May now be damn'd to animate an Ass;</l>
<l>Or in this very House, for ought we know,</l>
<l>Is doing painful Pennance in some <hi>Beau:</hi></l>
<l>And this our Audience, which did once resort</l>
<l>To shining Theatres to see our Sport,</l>
<l>Now find us toss'd into a Tennis-Court.</l>
<l>These Walls but t'other Day were fill'd with Noise</l>
<l>Of roaring Gamesters, and your <hi>Damme Boys:</hi></l>
<l>Then bounding Balls and Rackets they encompass'd,</l>
<l>And now they're fill'd with Jests, and Flights, and Bombast!</l>
<l>I vow, I don't much like this Transmigration,</l>
<l>Strolling from Place to Place, by Circulation.</l>
<l>Grant, Heaven, we don't return to our first Station.</l>
<l>I know not what these think, but for my Part,</l>
<l>I can't reflect without an aking Heart,</l>
<l>How we should end in our Original, a Cart.</l>
<l>But we can't fear, since you're so good to save us,</l>
<l>That you have only set us up to leave us.</l>
<l>Thus from the past, we hope for future Grace,</l>
<l>I beg it—</l>
<l>And some here know I have a begging Face.</l>
<l>Then pray continue this your kind Behaviour,</l>
<l>For a clear Stage won't do, without your Favour.</l>

<p>Sir.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Here, take away; I'll walk a Turn, and digest what I have read—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>You'll grow Devilish Fat upon this Paper-Diet. 
<stage>[Aside, and taking away the Books.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>And d'ye here, go you to Breakfast—There's a Page doubled down in <hi>Epictetus,</hi> that is a Feast for an Emperor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Was <hi>Epictetus</hi> a real Cook, or did he only write Receipts?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Read, read, Sirrah, and refine your Appetite; learn to live upon Instruction; feast your Mind, and mortifie your Flesh; read, and take your Nourishment in at your Eyes; shut up your Mouth, and chew the Gud of Understanding. So <hi>Epictetus</hi> advises.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>O Lord! I have heard much of him, when I waited upon a Gentleman at <hi>Cambridge:</hi> Pray what was that <hi>Epictetus?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>A very rich Man.—Not worth a Groat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Humph, and so he has made a very fine Feast, where there is nothing to be eaten.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Sir, you're a Gentleman, and probably understand this fine Feeding: But if you please, I had rather be at Board-Wages. Does your <hi>Epictetus,</hi> or your <hi>Seneca</hi> here, or any of these poor, rich Rogues, teach you how to pay your Debts without Mony? Will they shut up the Mouths of your Creditors? Will <hi>Plato</hi> be Bail for you! Or <hi>Diogenes,</hi> because he understands Confinements, and liv'd in a Tub, go to Prison for you? 'Slife, Sir, what do you mean, to mew your self up here with three or four musty Books, in Commendation of Starving and Poverty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sirrah, I have no Mony, you know it; and therefore resolve to rail at all that have: And in that I but follow the Examples of the wisest and wittiest Men in all Ages; these Poets and Philosophers whom you naturally hate, for just such another Reason; because they abound in Sense, and you are a Fool.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir, I am a Fool, I know it: And yet, Heav'n help me, I'm poor enough to be a Wit—But I was always a Fool, when I told you what your Expences would bring you to; your Coaches and your Liveries; your Treats and your Balls; your being in Love with a Lady, that did not care a Farthing for you in your Prosperity; and keeping Company with Wits, that car'd for nothing but your Prosperity; and now when you are poor, hate you as much as they do one another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Well; and now I am poor, I have an opportunity to be reveng'd on 'em all; I'll pursue <hi>Angelica</hi> with more Love than ever, and appear more notoriously her Admirer in this Restraint, than when I openly rival'd the rich Fops that made Court to her; so shall my Poverty be a Mortification to her Pride, and perhaps make her compassionate the Love, which has principally reduc'd me to this Lowness of Fortune. And for the Wits, I'm sure I'm in a Condition to be even with them.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Nay, your Condition is pretty even with theirs, that's the truth on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I'll take some of their Trade out of their Hands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Now Heav'n of Mercy continue the Tax upon Paper; you don't mean to Write!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I do; I'll write a Play.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Hem!—Sir, if you please to give me a small Certificate of three Lines—only to certifie those whom it may concern, That the Bearer hereof, <hi>Jeremy Fetch</hi> by Name, has for the space of seven Years truly and faithfuly serv'd <hi>Valentine Legend,</hi> <abbr>Esq</abbr> and that he is not now turn'd away for any Misdemeanour, but does voluntarily dismiss his Master from any future Authority over him.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>No, Sirrah, you shall live with me still.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Sir, it's impossible—I may die with you, starve with you, or be damn'd with your Works: But to live even three Days, the Life of a Play, I no more expect it, than to be Cannoniz'd for a Muse after my Decease.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>You are witty, you Rogue, I shall want your help;—I'll have you learn to make Couplets, to tag the Ends of Acts; d'ye hear, get the Maids to Crambo in an Evening, and learn the knack of rhiming, you may arrive at the height of a Song, sent by an unknown Hand, or a Chocolate-House Lampoon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>But Sir, is this the way to recover your Father's Favour? Why Sir <hi>Sampson</hi> will be irreconcilable. If your younger Brother shou'd come from Sea, he'd never look upon you again. You're undone, Sir; you're ruin'd; you won't have a Friend left in the World, if you turn Poet—Ah Pox confound that <hi>Will</hi>'s Coffee-House, it has ruin'd more Young Men than the <hi>Royal-Oak</hi> Lottery—Nothing thrives that belongs to't. The Man of the House would have been an Alderman by this time with half the Trade, if he had set up in the City—For my part, I never sit at the Door, that I don't get double the Stomach that I do at a Horse-Race. The Air upon <hi>Banstead-Downs</hi> is nothing to it for a Whetter; yet I never see it, but the Spirit of Famine appears to me, sometimes like a decay'd Porter, worn out with Pimping, and carrying <hi>Billet-doux</hi> and Songs; not like other Porters for Hire, but for the Jest's sake. Now like a thin Chair-man, melted down to half his Proportion, with carrying a Poet upon Tick to visit some great Fortune; and his Fare to be paid him like the Wages of Sin, either at the Day of Marriage, or the Day of Death.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Very well, Sir; can you proceed?</p>
</sp>

<p>Sometimes like a bilk'd Bookseller, with a meagre terrify'd Countenance, that looks as if he had written for himself, or were resolv'd to turn Author, and bring the rest of his Brethren into the same Condition. And lastly, in the Form of a worn-out Punk, with Verses in her Hand, which her Vanity had preferr'd to Settlements, without a whole Tatter to her Tail, but as ragged as one of the Muses; or as if she were carrying her Linnen to the Paper-Mill, to be converted into Folio Books, of Warning to all young Maids not to prefer Poetry to good Sense; or lying in the Arms of a needy Wit, before the Embraces of a wealthy Fool.</p>

<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>What, <hi>Jeremy</hi> holding forth?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>The Rogue has (with all the Wit he could muster up) been declaiming against Wit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Ay? Why then I'm afraid <hi>Jeremy</hi> has Wit: For whereever it is, it's always contriving its own Ruin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Why so I have been telling my Master, Sir: Mr. <hi>Scandal,</hi> for Heaven's sake, Sir, try if you can dissuade him from turning Poet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Poet! He shall turn Soldier first, and rather depend upon the outside of his Head than the Lining. Why, what the Devil has not your Poverty made you Enemies enough? Must you needs shew your Wit to get more?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Ay, more indeed; for who cares for any Body that has more Wit than himself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Jeremy speaks like an Oracle. Don't you see how worthless great Men, and dull rich Rogues, avoid a witty Man of small Fortune? Why, he looks like a Writ of Enquiry into their Titles and Estates, and seems Commission'd by Heav'n to seize the better half.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Therefore I would rail in my Writings, and be reveng'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Rail? At whom? the whole World? Impotent and Vain? Who would die a Martyr to Sense in a Country where the Religion is Folly? You may stand at Bay for a while; but when the full Cry is against you, you won't have fair Play for your Life. If you can't be fairly run down by the Hounds, you will be treacherously shot by the Huntsmen.—No, turn Pimp, Flatterer, Quack, Lawyer, Parson, be Chaplain to an Atheist, or Stallion to an Old Woman, any thing but Poet; a Modern Poet is worse, more servile, timorous and fawning, than any I have nam'd: Without you could retrieve the Ancient Honours of the Name, recal the Stage of <hi>Athens,</hi> and be allow'd the force of open honest Satire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>You are as inveterate against our Poets, as if your Character had been lately expos'd upon the Stage.—Nay, I am not violently bent upon the Trade—
<stage>[One knocks.]</stage> <hi>Jeremy,</hi> see who's there. 
<stage>[Ex. <hi>Jeremy.</hi>]</stage> But tell me what you would have me do?—What do the World say of me, and my forc'd Confinement?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>The World behaves it self as it used to do on such Occasions; some pity you, and condemn your Father; others excuse him, and blame you; only the Ladies are merciful, and wish you well, since Love and pleasurable Expence have been your greatest Faults.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>How now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Nothing new, Sir; I have dispatch'd some half a Dozen Duns, with as much Dexterity as a hungry Judge do's Causes at Dinner-time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>What Answer have you given 'em?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Patience, I suppose, the old Receipt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>No, Faith Sir; I have put 'em off so long with Patience and Forbearance, and other fair Words, that I was forc'd now to tell 'em in plain downright <hi>English</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>

<p>To Morrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>And how the Devil do you mean to keep your Word?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Keep it? Not at all; it has been so very much stretch'd, that I reckon it will break of course by to Morrow, and no Body be surpriz'd

<stage>[Knocking.]</stage>—Again! Sir, if you don't like my Negotiation, will you be pleas'd to answer these your self.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>See who they are,</p>
<stage>[Exit <hi>Jere.</hi></stage>
<p> By this, <hi>Scandal,</hi> you may see what it is to be great; Secretaries of State, Presidents of the Council, and Generals of an Army lead just such a Life as I do; have just such Crowds of Visitants in a Morning, all solliciting of past Promises; which are but a civiller sort of Duns, that lay claim to voluntary Debts.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>And you, like a true great Man, having engaged their Attendance, and promis'd more than ever you intend to perform, are more perplex'd to find Evasions, than you would be to invent the honest Means of keeping your Word, and gratifying your Creditors.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p><hi>Scandal,</hi> learn to spare your Friends, and do not provoke your Enemies; this Liberty of your Tongue, will one Day bring a Confinement on your Body, my Friend.</p>

<p>O Sir, there's <hi>Trapland</hi> the Scrivener, with two suspicious Fellows, like lawful Pads, that would knock a Man down with Pocket-Tipstaves—And there's your Father's Steward, and the Nurse with one of your Children from <hi>Twitnam.</hi></p>

Pound to pay my Debts, and make my Fortune. This was once propos'd before, and I refus'd it; but the present Impatience of my Creditors for their Mony, and my own Impatience of Confinement, and Absence from <hi>Angelica,</hi> force me to consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>A very desperate Demonstration of your Love to <hi>Angelica:</hi> And I think she has never given you any Assurance of hers.</p>

<p>You know her Temper; she never gave me any great reason either for Hope or Despair.</p>
</sp>

<p>Women of her airy Temper, as they seldom think before they act, so they rarely give us any Light to guess at what they mean: But you have little reason to believe that a Woman of this Age, who has had an Indifference for you in your Prosperity, will fall in love with your ill Fortune; besides, <hi>Angelica</hi> has a great Fortune of her own; and great Fortunes either expect another great Fortune, or a Fool.</p>

<p>No, prithee stay: <hi>Tattle</hi> and you should never be asunder; you are Light and Shadow, and shew one another; he is perfectly thy Reverse both in Humour and Understanding; and as you set up for Defamation, he is a Mender of Reputations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>A Mender of Reputations! ay, just as he is a Keeper of Secrets, another Virtue that he sets up for in the same manner. For the Rogue will speak aloud in the posture of a Whisper; and deny a Woman's Name, while he gives you the Marks of her Person: He will forswear receiving a Letter from her, and at the same time shew you her Hand upon the Superscription: And yet perhaps he has counterfeited the Hand too, and sworn to a Truth; but he hopes not to be believ'd; and refuses the Reputation of a Ladies Favour, as a Doctor says No to a Bishoprick, only that it may be granted him.—In short, he is a publick Professor of Secresie, and makes Proclamation that he holds private Intelligence.—He's here.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>But how barbarous that is, and how unfortunate for him, that the World shall think the better of any Person for his Calumniation!—I thank Heav'n, it has always been a part of my Character, to handle the Reputation of others very tenderly.</p>

<p>Ay, such rotten Reputations as you have to deal with, are to be handl'd tenderly indeed.</p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha; nay, now you make a Jest of it indeed. For there is nothing more known, than that no Body knows any thing of that nature of me: As I hope to be sav'd, <hi>Valentine,</hi> I never expos'd a Woman since I knew what Woman was.</p>

<p>I am strangely surpriz'd! Yes, yes, I can't deny't, if she taxes me with it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>She'll be here by and by, she sees <hi>Valentine</hi> every Morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="21"/>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>How!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>She does me the Favour—I mean of a Visit sometimes. I did not think she had granted more to any Body.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Nor I, Faith—But <hi>Tattle</hi> does not use to belie a Lady; it is contrary to his Character—How one may be deceiv'd in a Woman, <hi>Valentine?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Nay, what do you mean, Gentlemen?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>I'm resolv'd I'll ask her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>O Barbarous! why did you not tell me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>No, you told us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>And bid me ask <hi>Valentine.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>What did I say? I hope you won't bring me to confess an Answer, when you never ask'd me the Question.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>But, Gentlemen, this is the most Inhuman Proceeding—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if you have known <hi>Scandal</hi> thus long, and cannot avoid such a palpable Decoy as this was, the Ladies have a fine time, whose Reputations are in your keeping.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Jeremy.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Sir, Mrs. <hi>Frail</hi> has sent to know if you are stirring.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Shew her up when she comes.</p>
<stage>[Exit <hi>Jere.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>I'll be gone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>You'll meet her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Have you not a back way?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>If there were, you have more Discretion, than to give <hi>Scandal</hi> such an Advantage; why, your running away will prove all that he can tell her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p><hi>Scandal,</hi> you will not be so ungenerous—O, I shall lose my Reputation of Secresie for ever—I shall never be receiv'd but upon Publick Days, and my Visits will never be admitted beyond a Drawing-Room: I shall never see a Bed-Chamber again, never be lock'd in a Closet, nor run behind a Screen, or under a Table; never be distinguish'd among the Waiting-Women by the Name of Trusty Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi> more—You will not be so cruel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p><hi>Scandal,</hi> have Pity on him; he'll yield to any Conditions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Any, any Terms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Come then, sacrifice half a Dozen Women of good Reputation to me presently—Come, where are your familiar—And see that they are Women of Quality too, the first Quality.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>'Tis very hard—Won't a Baronet's Lady pass?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>No, nothing under a Right Honourable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>O Inhuman! You don't expect their Names.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>No, their Titles shall serve.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="22"/>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Alas, that's the same thing: Pray spare me their Titles; I'll describe their Persons.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Well, begin then: But take notice, if you are so ill a Painter, that I cannot know the Person by your Picture of her, you must be condemn'd, like other bad Painters, to write the Name at the bottom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Well, first then—</p>
<stage>Enter Mrs. <hi>Frail.</hi></stage>
<p>O unfortunate! she's come already; will you have Patience 'till another time—I'll double the number.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Well, on that Condition—Take heed you don't fail me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Frail.</speaker>
<p>Hey Day! I shall get a fine Reputation by coming to see Fellows in a Morning. <hi>Scandal,</hi> you Devil, are you here too? Oh Mr. <hi>Tattle,</hi> every thing is safe with you, we know.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Tattle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Mum—O Madam, you do me too much Honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Well Lady Galloper, how does <hi>Angelica?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p><hi>Angelica?</hi> Manners!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>What, you will allow an absent Lover—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>No, I'll allow a Lover present with his Mistress to be particular—But otherwise I think his Passion ought to give place to his Manners.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>But what if he have more Passion than Manners?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Then let him Marry and reform.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Marriage indeed may qualifie the Fury of his Passion, but it very rarely mends a Man's Manners.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>You are the most mistaken in the World; there is no Creature perfectly Civil but a Husband. For in a little time he grows only rude to his Wife, and that is the highest good Breeding, for it begets his Civility to other People. Well, I'll tell you News; but I suppose you hear your Brother <hi>Benjamin</hi> is landed: And my Brother <hi>Foresight's</hi> Daughter is come out of the Country—I assure you, there's a Match talk'd of by the Old People—Well, if he be but as great a Sea-Beast as she is a Land-Monster, we shall have a most Amphibious Breed—The Progeny will be all Otters; he has been bred at Sea, and she has never been out of the Country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Pox take'em, their Conjunction bodes me no good, I'm sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Now you talk of Conjunction, my Brother <hi>Foresight</hi> has cast both their Nativities, and Prognosticates an Admiral and an eminent Justice of the Peace to be the Issue-Male of their two Bodies; 'tis the most superstitious Old Fool! He would have persuaded me, that this was an unlucky Day, and would not let me come abroad: But I invented a Dream, and sent him to <hi>Artimedorus</hi>
<pb n="13" facs="23"/>
for Interpretation, and so stole out to see you. Well, and what will you give me now? Come, I must have something.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Step into the next Room—and I'll give you something.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Ay, we'll all give you something.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Well, what will you all give me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Mine's a Secret.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>I thought you would give me something, that would be a Trouble to you to keep.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>And <hi>Scandal</hi> shall give you a good Name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>That's more than he has for himself. And what will you give me, Mr. <hi>Tattle?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>I? My Soul, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Pooh, No I thank you, I have enough to do to take care of my own. Well; but I'll come and see you one of these Mornings: I here you have a great many Pictures.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>I have a pretty good Collection at your Service, some Originals.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Hang him, he has nothing but the <hi>Seasons</hi> and the <hi>Twelve Caesars,</hi> paultry Copies; and the <hi>Five Senses,</hi> as ill represented as they are in himself: And he himself is the only Original you will see there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but I hear he has a Closet of Beauties.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Yes, all that have done him Favours, if you will believe him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Ay, let me see those, Mr. <hi>Tattle.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Oh Madam, those are sacred to Love and Contemplation. No Man but the Painter and my self was ever bless'd with the Sight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Well, but a Woman—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Nor Woman, 'till she consented to have her Picture there too—for then she is obliged to keep the Secret.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>No, no; come to me if you wou'd see Pictures.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>You?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Yes faith, I can shew you your own Picture, and most of your Acquaintance to the Life, and as like as at <hi>Kneller</hi>'s.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>O lying Creature—<hi>Valentine,</hi> does not he lye?—I can't believe a Word he says.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>No indeed, he speaks Truth now: For as <hi>Tattle</hi> has Pictures of all that have granted him Favours, he has the Pictures of all that have refus'd him; if Satires, Descriptions, Characters and Lampoons are Pictures.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Yes, mine are most in black and white.—And yet there are some set out in their true Colours, both Men and Women. I can shew you Pride, Folly, Affectation, Wantonness, Inconstancy, Covetousness,
<pb n="14" facs="24"/>
Dissimulation, Malice, and Ignorance, all in one Piece. Then I can shew you Lying, Foppery, Vanity, Cowardise, Bragging, Lechery, Impotence, and Ugliness, in another Piece; and yet one of these is a celebrated Beauty, and t'other a profest Beau. I have Paintings too, some pleasant enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Come, let's hear 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Why, I have a Beau in a Bagnio, Cupping for a Complexion, and Sweating for a Shape.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>So.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Then I have a Lady burning of Brandy in a Cellar with a Hackney-Coachman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>O Devil! Well, but that Story is not true.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>I have some Hieroglyphicks too, I have a Lawyer with a hundred Hands, two Heads, and but one Face; a Divine with two Faces, and one Head; and I have a Soldier with his Brains in his Belly, and his Heart where his Head should be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>And no Head?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>No Head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Pooh, this is all Invention. Have you ne'er a Poet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I have a Poet weighing Words, and selling Praise for Praise, and a Critick picking his Pocket. I have another large Piece too, representing a School, where there are huge proportion'd Criticks, with long Wigs, lac'd Coats, <hi>Steinkirk</hi> Cravats, and terrible Faces; with Cat-calls in their Hands, and Hornbooks about their Necks. I have many more of this kind, very well Painted, as you shall see.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Well, I'll come, if it be only to disprove you.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Jeremy.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Sir, here's the Steward again from your Father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I'll come to him—will you give me leave, I'll wait on you again presently.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>No, I'll be gone. Come, who Squires me to the <hi>Exchange?</hi> I must call my Sister <hi>Foresight</hi> there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>I will; I have a mind to your Sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Civil!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>I will; because I have a Tender for your Ladyship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>That's somewhat the better Reason, to my Opinion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Well, if <hi>Tattle</hi> entertains you, I have the better Opportunity to engage your Sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Teli <hi>Angelica,</hi> I am about to make hard Conditions to come abroad, and be at Liberty to see her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>I'll give an account of you and your Proceedings. If Indiscretion be a sign of Love, you are the most a Lover of any Body
<pb n="15" facs="25"/>
that I know: You fancy that parting with your Estate, will help you to your Mistress—In my Mind he is a thoughtless Adventurer,</p>

<l>Or win a Mistress, with a losing Hand.</l>

<p>HEY day! What, are all the Women of my Family abroad? Is not my Wife come home? Nor my Sister, nor my Daughter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir.</p>
</sp>

<p>Mercy on us, what can be the meaning of it? Sure the Moon is in all her Fortitudes. Is my Niece <hi>Angelica</hi> at home?</p>

<p>Yes, Sir.</p>

<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>I say you lie, Sir. It is impossible that any thing should be as I would have it; for I was born, Sir, when the Crab was ascending, and all my Affairs go backward.</p>

<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>I can't tell indeed, Sir.</p>

<speaker>Nurse.</speaker>
<p>Wee'st heart, I know not, they're none of 'em come home yet: Poor Child, I warrant she's fond o'seeing the Town—Marry, pray Heav'n they ha' given her any Dinner—Good lack aday, ha, ha, ha, O strange; I'll vow and swear now, ha, ha, ha, Marry, and did you ever see the like!</p>

<p>Ha, How? Faith and troth I am glad of it, and so I have, that may be good Luck in troth, in troth it may, very good Luck: Nay I have had some Omens, I got out of Bed backwards too this Morning, without Premeditation; pretty good that too: But then I stumbled coming down Stairs, and met a Weasel; bad Omens those; some bad, some good, our Lives are checquer'd: Mirth and Sorrow, Want

<stage>Enter <hi>Angelica.</hi></stage>
<p>Sirrah, go tell Sir <hi>Sampson Legend</hi> I'll wait on him, if he's at leisure,—'tis now Three a Clock, a very good Hour for Business, <hi>Mercury</hi> governs this Hour.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Is not it a good Hour for Pleasure too, Uncle? Pray lend me your Coach, mine's out of Order.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>What, wou'd you be gadding too? Sure all Females are mad today—It is of evil Portent, and bodes Mischief to the Master of a Family—I remember an old Prophecy written by <hi>Messehalah</hi> the <hi>Arabian,</hi> and thus translated by a Reverend <hi>Buckinghamshire</hi> Bard:<l>When Housewifes all the House forsake,</l>
<l>And leave good Man to Brew and Bake,</l>
<l>Withouten Guile then be it said,</l>
<l>That House doth stond upon its Head;</l>
<l>And when the Head is set in Grond,</l>
<l>Ne marl, if it be fruitful fond.</l> Fruitful, the Head fruitful, that bodes Horns; the Fruit of the Head is Horns.—Dear Niece, stay at home—for by the Head of the House is meant the Husband; the Prophecy needs no Explanation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Well, but I can neither make you a Cuckold, Uncle, by going abroad; nor secure you from being one, by staying at home.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes; while there's one Woman left the Prophecy is not in full Force.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>But my Inclinations are in force; I have a mind to go abroad, and if you won't lend me your Coach, I'll take a Hackney, or a Chair, and leave you to erect a Scheme, and find who's in Conjunction with your Wife. Why don't you keep her at home, if you're Jealous when she's abroad? You know my Aunt is a little Retrograde (as you call it) in her Nature. Uncle, I'm afraid you are not Lord of the Ascendant; ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Well, Jill-flirt, you are very pert—and always ridiculing that Celestial Science.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Nay Uncle, don't be angry—If you are, I'll reap up all your false Prophecies, ridiculous Dreams, and idle Divinations. I'll swear you are a Nusance to the Neighbourhood—What a Bustle did you keep against the last invisible Eclipse, laying in Provision as 'twere for a Siege? What a world of Fire and Candle, Matches and Tinderboxes did you purchase! one would have thought
<pb n="17" facs="27"/>
we were ever after to live under Ground, or at least making a Voyage to <hi>Greenland,</hi> to inhabit there all the dark Season.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Why, you malapert Slut.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Will you lend me your Coach, or I'll go on—Nay, I'll declare how you Prophecy'd Popery was coming, only because the Butler had mislaid some of the Apostle's Spoons, and thought they were lost. Away went Religion and Spoon-meat together—Indeed, Uncle, I'll Indite you for a Wizard.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nurse.</speaker>
<p>O merciful Father, how she talks!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I can make Oath of your unlawful Midnight Practices; you and the Old Nurse there.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nurse.</speaker>
<p>Marry Heav'n defend—I at Midnight Practices—O Lord, what's here to do?—I in unlawful Doings with my Master's Worship—Why, did you ever hear the like now—Sir, did ever I do any thing of your Midnight Concerns—but warm your Bed, and tuck you up, and set the Candle, and your Tobacco-Box, and your Urinal by you, and now and then rub the Soles of your Feet?—O Lord, I!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I saw you together, through the Key-hole of the Closet, one Night, like <hi>Saul</hi> and the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> turning the Sieve and Sheers, and pricking your Thumbs to write poor innocent Servant's Names in Blood about a little Nutmeg-Grater, which she had forgot in the Caudle-Cup—Nay, I know something worse, if I would speak of it.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>I defie you, Hussy; but I'll remember this, I'll be reveng'd on you, Cockatrice; I'll hamper you—You have your Fortune in your own Hands—but I'll find a way to make your Lover, your Prodigal Spendthrift Gallant, <hi>Valentine,</hi> pay for all, I will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Will you? I care not, but all shall out then—Look to it, Nurse; I can bring Witness that you have a great unnatural Teat under your Left Arm, and he another; and that you Suckle a young Devil in the shape of a Tabby-Cat, by turns, I can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nurse.</speaker>
<p>A Teat, a Teat, I an unnatural Teat! O the false slanderous thing; feel, feel here, if I have any thing but like another Christian, 
<stage>[Crying.]</stage> or any Teats but two that han't given Suck this Thirty Years.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>I will have Patience, since it is the Will of the Stars I should be thus tormented—This is the Effect of the malicious Conjunctions and Oppositions in the Third House of my Nativity; there the Curse of Kindred was foretold—But I will have my Doors lock'd up—I'll punish you, not a Man shall enter my House.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Do, Uncle, lock 'em up quickly before my Aunt come home—You'll have a Letter for Alimony tomorrow Morning—But let me be gone first, and then let no Mankind come near the House, but Converse with Spirits and the Celestial Signs, the Bull, and the Ram, and the Goat. Bless me! there are a great many Horn'd Beasts among the Twelve Signs, Uncle. But Cuckolds go to Heav'n.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>But there's but one Virgin among the Twelve Signs, Spitfire, but one Virgin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Nor there had not been that one, if she had had to do with any thing but Astrologers, Uncle. That makes my Aunt go abroad.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>How? how? is that the reason? Come, you know something; tell me, and I'll forgive you; do, good Neice—Come, you shall have my Coach and Horses,—Faith and Troth you shall—Does my Wife complain? Come, I know Women tell one another—She is young and sanguine, has a wanton Hazle Eye, and was born under <hi>Gemini,</hi> which may incline her to Society; she has a Mole upon her Lip, with a moist Palm, and an open Liberality on the Mount of <hi>Venus.</hi></p>

<p>Well—Why, if I was born to be a Cuckold, there's no more to be said—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Sir <hi>Sampson Legend</hi> with a Paper.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Nor no more to be done, Old Boy; that's plain—here 'tis, I have it in my Hand, Old <hi>Ptolomee;</hi> I'll make the ungracious Prodigal know who begat him; I will, Old <hi>Nostrodamus.</hi> Why, I warrant my Son thought nothing belong'd to a Father, but Forgiveness and Affection; no Authority, no Correction, no Arbitrary Power; nothing to be done, but for him to offend, and me to pardon. I warrant you, if he danc'd 'till Dooms-day, he thought I was to pay the Piper. Well, but here it is under Black and White, <hi>Signatum,</hi>
<pb n="19" facs="29"/>
<hi>Sigillatum,</hi> and <hi>Deliberatum;</hi> that as soon as my Son <hi>Benjamin</hi> is arriv'd, he is to make over to him his Right of Inheritance. Where's my Daughter that is to be—Hah! old <hi>Merlin!</hi> Body o'me, I'm so glad I'm reveng'd on this undutiful Rogue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Odso, let me see; let me see the Paper—Ay, Faith and Troth, here 'tis, if it will but hold—I wish things were done, and the Conveyance made—When was this Sign'd? what Hour? Odso, you should have consulted me for the time. Well, but we'll make haste—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Haste, ay, ay; haste enough, my Son <hi>Ben</hi> will be in Town to Night—I have order'd my Lawyer to draw up Writings of Settlement and Jointure—All shall be done to Night—No matter for the time; prithee, Brother <hi>Foresight,</hi> leave Superstition—Pox o' th' time; there's no time but the time present, there's no more to be said of what's past, and all that is to come will happen. If the Sun shine by Day, and the Stars by Night, why, we shall know one another's Faces without the help of a Candle, and that's all the Stars are good for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>How, how? Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> that all? Give me leave to contradict you, and tell you, you are ignorant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>I tell you I am wise; and <hi>sapiens dominabitur astris;</hi> there's Latin for you to prove it, and an Argument to confound your <hi>Ephemeris</hi>—Ignorant!—I tell you I have travell'd old <hi>Fircu,</hi> and know the Globe. I have seen the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> where the Sun rises at Midnight, and sets at Noon-day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>But I tell you I have travell'd, and travell'd in the Celestial <hi>Spheres,</hi> know the <hi>Signs</hi> and the <hi>Planets,</hi> and their Houses. Can judge of Motions Direct and Retrograde, of <hi>Sextiles, Quadrates, Trines</hi> and <hi>Oppositions,</hi> Fiery <hi>Trigons</hi> and Aquatical <hi>Trigons.</hi> Know whether Life shall be long or short, happy or unhappy, whether Diseases are curable or incurable. If Journeys shall be prosperous, Undertakings successful; or Goods stol'n recover'd, I know—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>I know the length of the Emperor of <hi>China</hi>'s Foot; have kiss'd the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Slipper, and rid a Hunting upon an Elephant with the Cham of <hi>Tartary,</hi>—Body o'me, I have made a Cuckold of a King, and the present Majesty of <hi>Bantam</hi> is the Issue of these Loins.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>I know when Travellers Lie or speak Truth, when they don't know it themselves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>I have known an Astrologer made a Cuckold in the twinkling of a Star; and seen a Conjurer, that could not keep the Devil out of his Wives Circle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20" facs="30"/>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>What does he twit me with my Wife too? I must be better inform'd of this,—
<stage>[Aside.]</stage>—Do you mean my Wife, Sir <hi>Sampson?</hi> Tho' you made a Cuckold of the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> yet by the Body of the Sun—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>By the Horns of the Moon, you would say, Brother <hi>Capricorn.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p><hi>Capricorn</hi> in your Teeth, thou Modern <hi>Mandevil; Ferdinand Mendez Pinto</hi> was but a Type of thee, thou Liar of the first Magnitude. Take back your Paper of Inheritance; send your Son to Sea again. I'll Wed my Daughter to an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Mummy, e'er she shall Incorporate with a Contemner of Sciences, and a Defamer of Virtue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Body o' me, I have gone too far;—I must not provoke honest <hi>Albumazar,</hi>—an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Mummy is an Illustrious Creature, my trusty Hieroglyphick, and may have Significations of Futurity about him; Odsbud, I would my Son were an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Mummy for thy sake. What, thou art not angry for a Jest, my good <hi>Haly</hi>—I reverence the Sun, Moon and Stars with all my Heart.—What, I'll make thee a Present of a Mummy: Now I think on't, Body o' me, I have a Shoulder of an <hi>Egyptian</hi> King, that I purloin'd from one of the Pyramids, powder'd with Hieroglyphicks, thou shalt have it sent home to thy House, and make an Entertainment for all the <hi>Philomaths</hi> and Students in Physick and Astrology in and about <hi>London.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>But what do you know of my Wife, Sir <hi>Sampson?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Thy Wife is a Constellation of Virtues; she's the Moon, and thou art the Man in the Moon: Nay, she is more Illustrious than the Moon; for she has her Chastity without her Inconstancy, 'Sbud I was but in Jest.</p>
<stage>Enter <hi>Jeremy.</hi></stage>
<p>How now? who sent for you? Ha! what wou'd you have?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Nay; if you were but in Jest—Who's that Fellow? I don't like his Physiognomy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>My Son, Sir; what Son, Sir? My Son <hi>Benjamin,</hi> hoh?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, Mr. <hi>Valentine,</hi> my Master,—'tis the first time he has been abroad since his Confinement, and he comes to pay his Duty to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Valentine.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>He is here, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Your Blessing, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>You've had it already, Sir, I think I sent it you to Day in a Bill of Four Thousand Pound: A great deal of Mony, Brother <hi>Foresight.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="21" facs="31"/>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Aye indeed, Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> a great deal of Mony for a young Man, I wonder what he can do with it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Body o' me, so do I.—Hark ye, <hi>Valentine,</hi> if there is too much, refund the Superfluity: Dost hear Boy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Superfluity, Sir; it will scarce pay my Debts,—I hope you will have more Indulgence, than to oblige me to those hard Conditions which my Necessity sign'd to.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Sir, how, I beseech you, what were you pleas'd to intimate concerning Indulgence?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir, that you would not go to the extremity of the Conditions, but release me at least from some part.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Oh Sir, I understand you.—that's all, ha?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, all that I presume to ask.—But what you, out of fatherly Fondness, will be pleas'd to add, shall be doubly welcome.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>No doubt of it, sweet Sir, but your filial Piety and my fatherly Fondness wou'd fit like two Tallies.—Here's a Rogue, Brother <hi>Foresight,</hi> makes a Bargain under Hand and Seal in the Morning, and would be releas'd from it in the Afternoon; here's a Rogue, Dog, here's Conscience and Honesty; this is your Wit now, this is the Morality of your Wits! You area Wit, and have been a Beau, and may be a—Why Sirrah, is it not hereunder Hand and Seal—Can you deny it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I don't deny it.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, you'll be hang'd; I shall live to see you go up <hi>Holborn-Hill</hi>—Has he not a Rogue's Face?—Speak, Brother, you understand Physiognomy, a Hanging-look to me—of all my Boys the most unlike me; he has a damn'd <hi>Tyburn</hi>-face, without the Benefit o'the Clery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Hum—truly I don't care to discourage a young Man,—he has a violent Death in his Face; but I hope no Danger of Hanging.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Sir, is this Usage for your Son?—for that old Weatherheaded Fool, I know how to laugh at him; but you, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>You, Sir; and you, Sir.—Why, who are you, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Your Son, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>That's more than I know, Sir, and I believe not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Faith, I hope not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>What, wou'd you have your Mother a Whore! Did you ever hear the like! Did you ever hear the like! Body o' me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I would have an Excuse for your Barbarity and unnatural Usage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Excuse! Impudence! why Sirrah, may'nt I do what I please? Are not you my Slave? Did not I beget you? And might not I have chosen whether I would have begot you or no? Ouns who are
<pb n="22" facs="32"/>
you? Whence came you? What brought you into the World? How came you here, Sir? Here, to stand here, upon those two Legs, and look erect with that audacious Face, hah? Answer me that: Did you come a Voluntier into the World? Or did I beat up for you with the lawful Authority of a Parent, and press you to the Service?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I know no more why I came, than you do why you call'd me. But here I am, and if you don't mean to provide for me, I desire you would leave me as you found me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>With all my Heart: Come, uncase, strip, and go naked out of the World, as you came into't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>My Cloaths are soon put off:—But you must also deprive me of Reason, Thought, Passions, Inclinations, Affections, Appetites, Senses, and the huge Train of Attendants that you begot along with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Body o' me, what a many-headed Monster have I propaged!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I am of my self a plain easie simple Creature, and to be kept at small Expence; but the Retinue that you gave me are craving and invincible; they are so many Devils that you have rais'd, and will have Employment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>'Oons, what had I to do to get Children?—Can't a private Man be born without all these Followers?—Why nothing under an Emperor should be born with Appetites.—Why at this rate, a Fellow that has but a Groat in his Pocket may have a Stomach capable of a ten Shilling Ordinary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Nay that's as clear as the Sun; I'll make Oath of it before any Justice in <hi>Middlesex.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Here's a Cormorant too,—'S'heart this Fellow was not born with you?—I did not beget him, did I?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>By the Provision that's made for me, you might have begot me too:—Nay, and to tell your Worship another Truth, I believe you did, for I find I was born with those same Whoreson Appetites too, that my Master speaks of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Why look you there now,—I'll maintain it, that by the rule of right Reason, this Fellow ought to have been born without a Palate.—'S'heart, what should he do with a distinguishing Taste?—I warrant now he'd rather eat a Pheasant, than a piece of poor <hi>John;</hi> and smell now, why I warrant he can smell, and loves Perfumes above a stink,—why there's it; and Musick, don't you love Musick, Scoundrel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I have a reasonable good Ear, Sir, as to Jiggs and Country Dances, and the like; I don't much matter your <hi>Sola</hi>'s or <hi>Sonata</hi>'s, they give me the Spleen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="23" facs="33"/>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>The Spleen, ha, ha, ha, a Pox confound you—<hi>Sola</hi>'s and <hi>Sonata</hi>'s? 'Oons, whose Son are you? how were you engender'd, Muckworm?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>I am by my Father the Son of a Chair-man, my Mother sold Oisters in Winter, and Cucumbers in Summer; and I came up stairs into the World, for I was born in a Cellar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>By your Looks, you shou'd go up stairs out of the World too, Friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>And if this Rogue were anatomiz'd now, and dissected, he has his Vessels of Digestion and Concoction, and so forth, large enough for the Inside of a Cardinal, this Son of a Cucumber.—These things are unaccountable and unreasonable,—Body o'me, why was not I a Bear, that my Cubs might have liv'd upon sucking their Paws? Nature has been provident only to Bears and Spiders; the one has its Nutriment in his own Hands, and t' other spins his Habitation out of his Entrails.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Fortune was provident enough to supply all the Necessities of my Nature; if I had my right of Inheritance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Again! 'Ouns han't you four thousand Pound?—if I had it again, I would not give thee a Groat.—What, wouldst thou have me turn Pelican, and feed thee out of my own Vitals?—'S'heart, live by your Wits,—You were always fond of the Wits,—Now let's see, if you have Wit enough to keep your self?—Your Brother will be in Town to Night, or to Morrow Morning, and then look you perform Covenants, and so your Friend and Servant.—Come Brother <hi>Foresight.</hi></p>
<stage>[Exeunt Sir <hi>Samp.</hi> and <hi>Foresight.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>I told you what your Visit would come to.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>'Tis as much as I expected—I did not come to see him, I came to <hi>Angelica:</hi> But since she was gone abroad, it was easily turn'd another way; and at least look'd well on my side: What's here? Mrs. <hi>Foresight</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Frail,</hi> they are earnest,—I'll avoid 'em,—Come this way, and go and enquire when <hi>Angelica</hi> will return.</p>

<stage>Enter Mrs. <hi>Foresight</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Frail.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>What have you to do to watch me?—'S'life I'll do what I please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>You will?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Yes marry will I—A great piece of Business to go to <hi>Covent-Garden Square</hi> in a Hackney-Coach, and take a Turn with one's Friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Nay, two or three Turns, I'll take my Oath.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Well, what if I took twenty—I warrant, if you had
<pb n="24" facs="34"/>
been there, it had been only innocent Recreation,—Lord, where's the Comfort of this Life, if we can't have the Happiness of conversing where we like.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>But can't you converse at home?—I own it, I think there's no Happiness like conversing with an agreeable Man: I don't quarrel at that, nor I don't think but your Conversation was very innocent; but the Place is publick, and to be seen with a Man in a Hackney-Coach is scandalous: What if any Body else should have seen you alight, as I did?—How can any Body be happy, while they're in perpetual Fear of being seen and censur'd?—Besides it would not only reflect upon you, Sister, but me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Pooh, here's a Clutter—why should it reflect upon you?—I don't doubt but you have thought your self happy in a Hackney-Coach before now.—If I had gone to <hi>Knights-bridge,</hi> or to <hi>Chelsey,</hi> or to <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> or <hi>Barn-Elms</hi> with a Man alone—something might have been said.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Why, was I ever in any of these Places? What do you mean, Sister?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Was I? what do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>You have been at a worse Place.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>I at a worse Place, and with Man!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>I suppose you would not go alone to the <hi>World's-End.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>The World's End! What, do you mean to Banter me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Poor innocent! You don't know that there's a Place call'd the <hi>World's-End?</hi> I'll swear you can keep your Countenance purely, you'd make an Admirable Player.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>I'll swear you have a great deal of Impudence, and in my Mind too much for the Stage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Very well, that will appear who has most, You never were at the <hi>World's-End?</hi></p>

<p>No.</p>

<sp>

<p>You deny it positively to my Face.</p>

<p>Your Face, what's your Face?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>No matter for that, it's as good a Face as yours.</p>

<p>Not by a dozen Years wearing.—But I do deny it positively to your Face then.</p>

<p>I'll allow you now to find fault with my Face;—for I'll swear your Impudence has put me out of Countenance:—But look you here now,—where did you lose this Gold Bodkin?—O Sister, Sister!</p>
</sp>

<p>My Bodkin!</p>

<p>O Devil on't, that I could not discover her without betraying my self.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>It's very true, Sister: Well, since all's out, and as you say, since we are both wounded, let us do that is often done in Duels, take care of one another, and grow better Friends than before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>With all my Heart, ours are but slight Flesh Wounds, and if we keep 'em from Air, not at all dangerous: Well, give me your Hand in token of Sisterly Secresie and Affection.</p>

<p>Here 'tis with all my Heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Well, as an Earnest of Friendship and Confidence, I'll acquaint you with a Design that I have: To tell Truth, and speak openly one to another, I'm afraid the World have observ'd us more than we have observ'd one another. You have a Rich Husband, and are provided for, I am at a loss, and have no great Stock either of Fortune or Reputation; and therefore must look sharply about me. Sir <hi>Sampson</hi> has a Son that is expected to Night; and by the Account I have heard of his Education, can be no Conjurer: The Estate you know is to be made over to him:—Now if I could wheedle him, Sister, ha? You understand me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>I do; and will help you to the utmost of my Power—And I can tell you one thing that falls out luckily enough; my aukward Daughter-in-Law, who you know is design'd for his Wife, is grown fond of Mr. <hi>Tattle;</hi> now if we can improve that, and make her have an Aversion for the Booby, it may go a great way towards his liking of you. Here they come together; and let us contrive some way or other to leave 'em together.</p>

<stage>Enter <hi>Tattle</hi> and Miss <hi>Prue.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>Mother, Mother, Mother, look you here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Fie, fie, Miss, how you bawl—besides, I have told you, you must not call me Mother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>What must I call you then, are you not my Father's Wife?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Madam; you must say Madam—By my Soul, I shall fancy my self Old indeed, to have this great Girl call me Mother—Well, but Miss, what are you so overjoy'd at?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>Look you here, Madam then, what Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi> has given me—Look you here Cousin, here's a Snuff-box; nay,
<pb n="26" facs="36"/>
there's Snuff in't;—here, will you have any—Oh good! how sweet it is—Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi> is all over sweet, his Perruke is sweet, and his Gloves are sweet,—and his Handkerchief is sweet, pure sweet, sweeter than Roses—Smell him Mother, Madam, I mean—He gave me this Ring for a Kiss.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>O fie Miss, you must not kiss and tell.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>Yes; I may tell my Mother—And he says he'll give me something to make me smell so—Oh pray lend me your Handkerchief—Smell Cousin; he says he'll give me something that will make my Smocks smell this way—Is not it pure?—It's better than Lavender mun—I'm resolv'd I won't let Nurse put any more Lavender among my Smocks—ha, Cousin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Fie, Miss; amongst your Linnen, you must say—You must never say Smock.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>Why, it is not Bawdy, is it Cousin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Oh Madam, you are too severe upon Miss; you must not find Fault with her pretty Simplicity, it becomes her strangely—pretty Miss, don't let 'em persuade you out of your Innocency.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Demm you Toad—I wish you don't persuade her out of her Innocency.</p>

<p>Ah Devil, sly Devil—He's as close, Sister, as a Confessor—He thinks we don't observe him.</p>
</sp>

<p>A cunning Cur, how soon he could find out a fresh harmless Creature; and left us, Sister, presently.</p>

<p>They're all so, Sister, these Men—they love to have the spoiling of a Young Thing, they are as fond of it, as of being first in the Fashion, or of seeing a new Play the first Day,—I warrant it would break Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi>'s Heart, to think that any Body else should be before-hand with him.</p>

<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Oh Lord, I swear I would not for the World—</p>

<p>O hang you; who'll believe you?—You'd be hang'd before you'd confess—we know you—she's very pretty!—Lord, what pure red and white!—she looks so wholesome;—ne'er stir, I don't know, but I fancy, if I were a Man—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>O' my Soul, I'm afraid not—eh!—filthy Creature, that smells all of Pitch and Tar—Devil take you, you confounded Toad—why did you see her, before she was Married?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Nay, why did we let him—my Husband will hang us—He'll think we brought 'em acquainted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Come, Faith let us be gone—If my Brother <hi>Foresight</hi> should find us with them;—he'd think so, sure enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>So he would—but then leaving 'em together is as bad—And he's such a sly Devil, he'll never miss an Opportunity.</p>

<p>Yes, my Dear—I think I can guess—But hang me if I know the reason of it.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>Come, must not we go too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>No, no, they don't mean that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>No! what then? what shall you and I do together?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>I must make Love to you, pretty Miss; will you let me make Love to you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>Yes, if you please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Frank, I Gad, at least. What a Pox does Mrs. <hi>Foresight</hi> mean by this Civility? is it to make a Fool of me? or does she leave us together out of good Morality, and do as she would be done by—Gad I'll understand it so. 
<stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>Well; and how will you make Love to me—Come, I long to have you begin—must I make Love too? You must tell me how.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>You must let me speak, Miss, you must not speak first; I must ask you Questions, and you must answer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>What, is it like the Catechism?—Come then ask me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>D'ye think you can Love me?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>

<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Pooh, Pox, you must not say yes already; I shan't care a Farthing for you then in a twinkling.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="28" facs="38"/>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>What must I say then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Why you must say no, or you believe not, or you can't tell—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>Why, must I tell a Lie then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Yes, if you would be well bred. All well-bred Persons Lie—Besides, you are a Woman, you must never speak what you think: Your Words must contradict your Thoughts; but your Actions may contradict your Words. So, when I ask you if you can Love me, you must say no, but you must Love me too—If I tell you you are Handsome, you must deny it, and say I flatter you—But you must think your self more Charming than I speak you;—and like me, for the Beauty which I say you have, as much as if I had it my self—If I ask you to Kiss me, you must be angry, but you must not refuse me. If I ask you for more, you must be more angry,—but more complying; and as soon as ever I make you say you'll cry out, you must be sure to hold your Tongue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>O Lord, I swear this is pure,—I like it better than our old fashion'd Country way of speaking ones Mind;—and must not you Lie too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Hum—Yes—But you must believe I speak Truth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>O <hi>Gemini!</hi> well, I always had a great mind to tell Lies—but they frighted me, and said it was a Sin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Well, my pretty Creature; will you make me happy by giving me a Kiss?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>No, indeed; I'm angry at you.—</p>
<stage>[Runs and kisses him.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Hold, hold, that's pretty well—but you should not have given it me, but have suffer'd me to take it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>Well, we'll do it again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>With all my Heart,—Now then, my little Angel.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>

<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>That's right,—Again, my Charmer.</p>
<stage>[Kisses again.</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>O fie, nay, now I can't abide you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Admirable! That was as well as if you had been born and bred in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> all the Days of your Life;—And won't you shew me, pretty Miss, where your Bed-Chamber is?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>No, indeed won't I; but I'll run there, and hide my self from you behind the Curtains.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>I'll follow you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Prue.</speaker>
<p>Ah, but I'll hold the Door with both Hands, and be angry;—and you shall push me down before you come in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>No, I'll come in first, and push you down afterwards.</p>

<p>There's no occasion for a Lie, I could never tell a Lie to no purpose—But since we have done nothing, we must say nothing, I think. I hear her—I'll leave you together, and come off as you can.</p>

<p>You can't accuse me of Inconstancy; I never told you that I lov'd you.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>But I can accuse you of Uncertainty, for not telling me whether you did or no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>You mistake Indifference for Uncertainty; I never had Concern enough to ask my self the Question.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Nor good Nature enough to answer him that did ask you: I'll say that for you, Madam.</p>

<p>What, are you setting up for good Nature?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Only for the Affectation of it, as the Women do for ill Nature.</p>

<p>Persuade your Friend that it is all Affectation.</p>

<p>Yes, but I dare trust you; we were talking of <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Love for <hi>Valentine;</hi> you wont speak of it.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>No, no, not a Syllable—I know that's a Secret, for it's whisper'd every where.</p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p>Your Love of <hi>Valentine.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>How!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>No, Madam, his Love for your Ladyship—Gad take me, I beg your Pardon—for I never heard a Word of your Ladyship's Passion, 'till this Instant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>My Passion! And who told you of my Passion, pray Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Why, is the Devil in you? Did not I tell it you for a Secret?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Gadso; but I thought she might have been trusted with her own Affairs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Is that your Discretion? Trust a Woman with her self?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>You say true, I beg your Pardon;—I'll bring all off—It was impossible, Madam, for me to imagine, that a Person of your Ladyship's Wit and Gallantry, could have so long receiv'd the passionate Addresses of the accomplish'd <hi>Valentine,</hi> and yet remain insensible; therefore you will pardon me, if from a just Weight of his Merit, with your Ladyship's good Judgment, I form'd the Ballance of a reciprocal Affection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>O the Devil, what damn'd Costive Poet has given thee this Lesson of Fustian to get by Rote?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>I dare swear you wrong him, it is his own—And Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi> only judges of the Success of others, from the Effects of his own Merit. For certainly Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi> was never deny'd any thing in his Life.</p>

<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>O Lord! yes indeed, Madam, several times.</p>

<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>I swear I don't think 'tis possible.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I vow and swear I have; Lord, Madam, I'm the most unfortunate Man in the World, and the most cruelly us'd by the Ladies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Nay, now you're ungrateful.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>No, I hope not—'tis as much Ingratitude to own some Favours, as to conceal others.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>There, now it's out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>I don't understand you now. I thought you had never ask'd any thing, but what a Lady might modestly grant, and you confess.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>So faith, your Business is done here; now you may go brag somewhere else.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Brag! O Heav'ns! Why, did I name any body?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>No; I suppose that is not in your Power; but you wou'd if you cou'd, no doubt on't.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Not in my Power, Madam! What, does your Ladyship mean, that I have no Woman's Reputation in my Power?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Ouns, why you won't own it, will you? 
<stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Faith, Madam, you are in the right; no more I have, as I hope to be sav'd; I never had it in my Power to say any thing to a Lady's Prejudice in my Life—For as I was telling you, Madam, I have been the most unsuccesful Creature living, in things of that Nature; and never had the good Fortune to be trusted once with a Lady's Secret, not once.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>No!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Not once, I dare answer for him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>And I'll answer for him; for I'm sure if he had, he would have told me: I find, Madam, you don't know Mr. <hi>Tattle.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>No indeed, Madam, you don't know me at all, I find: For sure my intimate Friends would have known—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Then it seems you would have told, if you had been trusted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>O Pox, <hi>Scandal,</hi> that was too far put—Never have told Particulars, Madam. Perhaps I might have talk'd as of a Third Person—or have introduc'd an Amour of my own, in Conversation, by way of Novel: But never have explain'd Particulars.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>But whence comes the Reputation of Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi>'s Secresie, if he was never trusted?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Why thence it arises—The Thing is proverbially spoken; but may be apply'd to him—As if we should say in general Terms, he only is Secret who never was trusted; a Satyrical Proverb upon our Sex—There's another upon yours
<pb n="32" facs="42"/>
—As she is chaste, who was never ask'd the Question. That's all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>A couple of very civil Proverbs, truly: 'Tis hard to tell whether the Lady or Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi> be the more oblig'd to you. For you found her Virtue upon the Backwardness of the Men; and his Secresie upon the Mistrust of the Women.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Gad, it's very true, Madam, I think we are oblig'd to acquit our selves—And for my part—But your Ladyship is to speak first—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Am I? Well, I freely confess I have resisted a great deal of Temptation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>And I Gad, I have given some Temptation that has not been resisted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Good.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>I cite <hi>Valentine</hi> here, to declare to the Court, how fruitless he has found his Endeavours, and to confess all his Sollicitations and my Denials.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I am ready to plead, Not guilty, for you; and Guilty, for my self.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>So, why this is fair, here's Demonstration with a Witness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Well, my Witnesses are not present—But I confess I have had Favours from Persons—But as the Favours are numberless, so the Persons are nameless.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Pooh, pox, this proves nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>No? I can shew Letters, Lockets, Pictures, and Rings; and if there be occasion for Witnesses, I can summon the Maids at the Chocolate-Houses, all the Porters of <hi>Pall-Mall</hi> and <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> the Door-keepers at the Play-House, the Drawers at <hi>Locket</hi>'s, <hi>Pontack</hi>'s, the <hi>Rummer, Spring-Garden;</hi> my own Landlady and <hi>Valetde Chambre;</hi> all who shall make Oath, that I receive more Letters than the Secretary's Office; and that I have more Vizor-Masks to enquire for me, than ever went to see the Hermaphrodite, or the Naked Prince. And it is notorious, that in a Country Church, once, an Enquiry being made, who I was, it was answer'd, I was the famous <hi>Tattle,</hi> who had ruin'd so many Women.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>It was there, I suppose, you got the Nick-name of the <hi>Great Turk</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>True; I was call'd <hi>Turk-Tattle</hi> all over the Parish—The next <hi>Sunday,</hi> all the Old Women kept their Daughters at home, and the Parson had not half his Congregation. He would have brought me into the Spiritual Court, but I was reveng'd upon him, for he had a handsom Daughter whom I initiated into the
<pb n="33" facs="43"/>
Science. But I repented it afterwards, for it was talk'd of in Town—And a Lady of Quality that shall be nameless, in a raging Fit of Jealousie, came down in her Coach and Six Horses, and expos'd her self upon my Account; Gad, I was sorry for it with all my Heart—You know whom I mean—You know where we raffled—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Mum, <hi>Tattle.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>'Sdeath, are not you asham'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>O barbarous! I never heard so Insolent a piece of Vanity—Fie, Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi>—I'll swear I could not have believ'd it—Is this your Secresie?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Gad so, the Heat of my Story carry'd me beyond my Discretion, as the Heat of the Lady's Passion hurry'd her beyond her Reputation—But I hope you don't know whom I mean; for there was a great many Ladies raffled—Pox on't, now could I bite off my Tongue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>No don't; for then you'll tell us no more—Come, I'll recommend a Song to you upon the Hint of my two Proverbs, and I see one in the next Room that will sing it.</p>

<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>What, is my Son <hi>Valentine</hi> gone? What, is he sneak'd off, and would not see his Brother? There's an Unnatural Whelp! There's an Ill-natur'd Dog! What, were you here too, Madam, and could not keep him! Could neither Love, nor Duty, nor Natural Affection oblige him. Odsbud, Madam, have no more to say to him; he is not worth your Consideration. The Rogue has not a Drachm of generous Love about him: All Interest, all Interest; he's an undone Scoundrel, and Courts your Estate: Body o' me, he does not care a Doit for your Person.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>I'm pretty even with him, Sir <hi>Sampson;</hi> for if ever I could have lik'd any thing in him, it should have been his Estate too: But since that's gone, the Bait's off, and the naked Hook appears.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Odsbud, well spoken; and you are a Wiser Woman than I thought you were: For most young Women now a-days are to be tempted with a naked Hook.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>If I Marry, Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> I'm for a good Estate with any Man, and for any Man with a good Estate: Therefore if I were oblig'd to make Choice, I declare I'd rather have you than your Son.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Faith and Troth you're a Wise Woman, and I'm glad to hear you say so; I was afraid you were in Love with the Reprobate: Odd, I was sorry for you with all my Heart: Hang him, Mungrel; cast him off; you shall see the Rogue shew himself, and make Love to some desponding <hi>Cadua</hi> of Fourscore for Sustenance. Odd, I love to see a young Spendthrift forc'd to cling to an Old Woman for Support, like Ivy round a dead Oak: Faith
<pb n="35" facs="45"/>
I do; I love to see 'em hug and cotten together, like Down upon a Thistle.</p>

<p>Where's Father?</p>

<p>There, Sir, his Back's toward you.</p>

<p>My Son <hi>Ben!</hi> bless thee my dear Boy; Body o'me, thou art heartily welcome.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Thank you, Father, and I'm glad to see you.</p>

<p>So, so, enough Father—Mess, I'd rather kiss these Gentlewomen.</p>

<p>And so thou shalt,—Mrs. <hi>Angelica,</hi> my Son <hi>Ben.</hi></p>
</sp>

<p>Forsooth an you please—

<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Sir, you're welcome a-shoar.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Thank you, thank you, Friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Thou hast been many a weary League, <hi>Ben,</hi> since I saw thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Ey, ey, been! Been far enough, an that be all—well Father, and how do all at home? How does Brother <hi>Dick,</hi> and Brother <hi>Val.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p><hi>Dick,</hi> Body o'me, <hi>Dick</hi> has been dead these two Years; I writ you Word, when you were at <hi>Legorne.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Mess, and that's true; marry I had forgot. <hi>Dick</hi>'s dead as you say—Well, and how, I have a many Questions to ask you; well, you ben't marry'd again, Father, be you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>No, I intend you shall marry, <hi>Ben;</hi> I would not marry for thy sake.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Nay, what does that signifie?—An you marry again—why then I'll go to Sea again; so there's one for t'other, an that be all—Pray don't let me be your hindrance; e'en marry a God's Name an the Wind sit that way. As for my part, may-hap I have no Mind to marry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>That would be pity, such a Handsome Young Gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Handsome! he, he, he, nay forsooth, an you be for Joking, I'll Joke with you, for I love my Jest, an the Ship were sinking, as we sayn at Sea. But I'll tell you why I don't much stand towards Matrimony. I love to roam about from Port to Port, and from Land to Land: I could never abide to be Port-bound, as we call it: Now a Man that is marry'd, has as it were, d'ye see, his
<pb n="36" facs="46"/>
Feet in the Bilboes, and may-hap mayn't get 'em out again when he would.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p><hi>Ben</hi>'s a Wag.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>A Man that is marry'd, d'ye see, is no more like another Man, than a Gally-slave is like one of us free Sailors, he is chain'd to an Oar all his Life, and may-hap forc'd to tug a leaky Vessel into the Bargain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>A very Wag, <hi>Ben</hi>'s a very Wag; only a little rough, he wants a little Polishing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Not at all; I like his Humour mightily, it's plain and honest, I should like such a Humour in a Husband extreamly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Say'n you so Forsooth? marry and I shou'd like such a Handsom Gentlewoman for a Bed-fellow hugely; how say you, Mistress, would you like going to Sea? Mess, you're a tight Vessel, and well Rigg'd, an you were but as well Mann'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>I should not doubt that, if you were Master of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>But I'll tell you one thing, an you come to Sea in a high Wind, or that Lady—You mayn't carry so much Sail o'your Head—Top and Top-gallant, by the Mess.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>No, why so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Why, an you do, you may run the risk to be over-set, and then you'll carry your Keels above Water, he, he, he.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>I swear, Mr. <hi>Benjamin</hi> is the verriest Wag in Nature, an absolute Sea-wit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Nay, <hi>Ben</hi> has Parts, but, as I told you before, they want a little Polishing: You must not take any thing ill, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>No, I hope the Gentlewoman is not angry; I mean all in good part: For if I give a Jest, I'll take a Jest: And so Forsooth you may be as free with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>I thank you, Sir, I am not at all offended;—but methinks, Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> you should leave him alone with his Mistress. Mr. <hi>Tattle,</hi> we must not hinder Lovers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Well, Miss, I have your Promise. 
<stage>[Aside to Miss.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Body o' me, Madam, you say true:—Look you, <hi>Ben;</hi> this is your Mistress,—Come, Miss, you must not be shamefac'd, we'll leave you together.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>I can't abide to be left alone, mayn't my Cousin stay with me?</p>

<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>No, no. Come, let's away.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Come Mistress, will you please to sit down? for an you stand a stern a that'n, we shall never grapple together—Come, I'll haule a Chair; there, an you please to sit, I'll sit by you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>You need not sit so near one, if you have any thing to say, I can hear you farther off, I an't deaf.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Why that's true, as you say, nor I an't dumb, I can be heard as far as another,—I'll heave off to please you. 
<stage>[Sits further off.</stage> An we were a League asunder, I'd undertake to hold Discourse with you, an 'twere not a main high Wind indeed, and full in my Teeth. Look you forsooth, I am as it were bound for the Land of Matrimony; 'tis a Voyage, d'ye see, that was none of my seeking, I was commanded by Father, and if you like of it, may-hap I may steer into your Harbour. How say you, Mistress, the short of the thing is this, that if you like me, and I like you, we may chance to swing in a Hammock together.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>I dont know what to say to you, nor I don't care to speak with you at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>No, I'm sorry for that—But pray, why are you so scornful?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>As long as one must not speak one's Mind, one had better not speak at all, I think, and truly I won't tell a Lie for the matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Nay, you say true in that, it's but a folly to lie: For to speak one thing, and to think just the contrary way; is as it were, to look one way, and to row another. Now, for my part d'ye see, I'm for carrying things above Board, I'm not for keeping any thing under Hatches,—so that if you ben't as willing as I, say so a God's name, there's no harm done; may-hap you may beshamefac'd; some Maidens, thof' they love a Man well enough, yet they don't care to tell'n so to's Face: If that's the Case, why Silence gives Consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>But I'm sure it is not so, for I'll speak sooner than you should believe that; and I'll speak Truth, tho' one should always tell a Lie to a Man; and I don't care, let my Father do what he will; I'm too big to be whipp'd, so I'll tell you plainly, I don't like you, nor love you at all, nor never will, that's more: So, there's your Answer for you; and don't trouble me no more, you ugly thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Look you, Young Woman, you may learn to give good Words however. I spoke you fair, d'ye see, and civil.—As for
<pb n="38" facs="48"/>
your Love or your Liking, I don't value it of a Rope's end;—And may-hap I like you as little as you do me:—What I said was in obedience to Father; Gad, I fear a whipping no more than you do. But I tell you one thing, if you should give such Language at Sea, you'd have a Cat o' Nine-tails laid cross your Shoulders. Flesh! who are you? You heard t'other handsome Young Woman speak civilly to me, of her own accord: Whatever you think of your self, Gad I don't think you are any more to compare to her, than a Can of Small-beer to a Bowl of Punch.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>Well, and there's a handsome Gentleman, and a fine Gentleman, and a sweet Gentleman that was here, that loves me, and I love him; and if he sees you speak to me any more, he'll thrash your Jacket for you, he will, you great Sea-calf.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>What, do you mean that fair-weather Spark that was here just now? Will he thrash my Jacket?—Let'n—let'n—But an he comes near me, may-hap I may giv'n a Salt Eelfor's Supper, for all that. What does Father mean, to leave me alone as soon as I come home with such a dirty Dowdy.—Sea-calf? I an't Calf enough to lick your chalk'd Face, you Cheese-curd you,—marry thee! Oons, I'll marry a <hi>Lapland</hi> Witch as soon, and live upon selling of contrary Winds, and wrack'd Vessels.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>I won't be call'd Names, nor I won't be abus'd thus, so I won't.—If I were a Man—

Odd if he should I could not be angry with him; 'twould be but like me, <hi>A Chip of the Old Block.</hi> Ha! thou'rt melancholy, old Prognostication; as melancholy as if thou hadst spilt the Salt, or par'd thy Nails of a Sunday:—Come, cheer up, look about thee: Look up, old Star-Gazer.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Hoity toity, what have I to do with his Dreams or his Divination—Body o' me, this is a Trick to defer Signing the Conveyance. I warrant the Devil will tell him in a Dream, that he must not part with his Estate: But I'll bring him a Parson to tell him, that the Devil's a Liar—Or if that won't do, I'll bring a Lawyer that shall out-lie the Devil. And so I'll try whether my Black-Guard or his shall get the better of the Day.</p>

<p>Alas, Mr. <hi>Foresight,</hi> I'm afraid all is not right—You are a wise Man, and a conscientious Man; a Searcher into Obscurity and Futurity; and if you commit an Error, it is with a great deal of Consideration, and Discretion, and Caution—</p>

<p>Nay, nay, 'tis manifest; I do not flatter you—But Sir <hi>Sampson</hi> is hasty, very hasty;—I'm afraid he is not scrupulous enough, Mr. <hi>Foresight</hi>—He has been wicked, and Heav'n grant he may mean well in his Affair with you—But my Mind gives me, these things cannot be wholly insignificant.

<p>You say true, Man will err; meer Man will err—but you are something more—There have been wise Men; but they were such as you—Men who consulted the Stars, and were Observers of Omens—<hi>Salomon</hi> was Wise, but how?—by his Judgment in Astrology—So says <hi>Pineda,</hi> in his Third Book and Eighth Chapter—</p>

<p>You are learn'd, Mr. <hi>Scandal</hi>—</p>

I do not like that sudden Flushing—Gone already!—hem, hem, hem! faintish. My Heart is pretty good; yet it beats; and my Pulses, ha!—I have none—Mercy on me—hum—Yes, here they are—Gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, hey! Whither will they hurry me?—Now they're gone again—And now I'm faint again; and pale again, and hem! and my hem!—breath, hem!—grows short; hem! hem! he, he, hem!</p>

<p>Well, and what Use do you hope to make of this Project? You don't think that you are ever like to succeed in your Design upon me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Faith I do; I have a better Opinion both of you and my self than to despair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Did you ever hear such a Toad—harkye Devil; do you think any Woman honest?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Yes, several, very honest;—they'll cheat a little at Cards, sometimes, but that's nothing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! but Virtuous, I mean.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Faith, I believe some Women are Virtuous too; but 'tis as I believe some Men are Valiant, thro' Fear—For why should a Man court Danger, or a Woman shun Pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>O Monstrous! What are Conscience and Honour?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Why, Honour is a Publick Enemy, and Conscience a Domestick Thief; and he that would secure his Pleasure, must pay a Tribute to one, and go halves with t'other. As for Honour, that you have secur'd, for you have purchas'd a perpetual Opportunity for Pleasure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>An Opportunity for Pleasure!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Ay, your Husband, a Husband is an Opportunity for Pleasure, so you have taken care of Honour, and 'tis the least I can do to take care of Conscience.</p>

<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>And so you think we are free for one another?</p>

<p>Why then I'll speak my Mind. Now as to this Affair between you and me. Here you make Love to me; why, I'll confess it does not displease me. Your Person is well enough, and your Understanding is not amiss.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>I have no great Opinion of my self; yet, I think, I'm neither Deform'd, nor a Fool.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>But you have a Villanous Character; you are a Libertine in Speech, as well as Practice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Come, I know what you would say,—you think it more dangerous to be seen in Conversation with me, than to allow some other Men the last Favour; you mistake, the Liberty I take in Talking is purely affected for the Service of your Sex. He that first cries out stop Thief, is often he that has stoln the Treasure. I am a Juggler, that act by Confederacy; and if you please, we'll put a Trick upon the World.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Ay; but you are such an universal Juggler,—that I'm afraid you have a great many Confederates.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Mess, I love to speak my Mind—Father has nothing to do with me—Nay, I can't say that neither; he has something to do with me. But what does that signifie? If so be, that I ben't minded to be steer'd by him; 'tis as tho'f he should strive against Wind and Tide.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but my Dear, we must keep it secret 'till the Estate be settled; for you know Marrying without an Estate, is like Sailing in a Ship without Ballast.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>He, he, he; why that's true; just so for all the World it is indeed, as like as two Cable Ropes.</p>

<p>And tho' I have a good Portion; you know one would not venture all in one Bottom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Why that's true again; for may-hap one Bottom may spring a Leak. You have hit it indeed, Mess you've nick'd the Channel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Well, but if you should forsake me after all, you'd break my Heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="45" facs="55"/>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Break your Heart? I'de rather the <hi>Mary-gold</hi> should break her Cable in a Storm, as well as I love her. Flesh, you don't think I'm false-hearted, like a Land-man. A Sailer will be honest, thof' may-hap he has never a Penny of Mony in his Pocket—May-hap I may not have so fair a Face, as a Citizen or a Courtier; but for all that, I've as good Blood in my Veins, and a Heart as sound as a Bisket.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>And will you love me always?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Nay, an I love once, I'll stick like Pitch; I'll tell you that. Come, I'll sing you a Song of a Sailor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Hold, there's my Sister, I'll call her to hear it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Well; I won't go to Bed to my Husband to night; because I'll retire to my own Chamber, and think of what you have said.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Well; you'll give me leave to wait upon you to your Chamber-door; and leave you my last Instructions?</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Hold, here's my Sister coming toward us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>If it won't interrupt you, I'll entertain you with a Song.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>The Song was made upon one of our Ships-Crew's Wife; our Boat-swain made the Song, may-hap you may know her, Sir. Before she was marry'd, she was call'd Buxom <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Deptford.</hi></p>

Dreaming is the poor Retreat of a lazy, hopeless, and imperfect Lover; 'tis the last glimpse of Love to worn-out Sinners, and the faint Dawning of a Bliss to wishing Girls, and growing Boys.</p>

<p>WELL, is your Master ready; does he look madly, and talk madly?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir; you need make no great Doubt of that; he that was so near turning Poet yesterday Morning, can't be much to seek in playing the Madman to Day.</p>

<p>Would he have <hi>Angelica</hi> acquainted with the Reason of his Design?</p>
</sp>

<p>No, Sir, not yet;—He has a mind to try, whether his playing the Madman, won't make her play the Fool, and fall in Love with him; or at least own, that she has lov'd him all this while, and conceal'd it.</p>

<p>I saw her take Coach just now with her Maid; and think I heard her bid the Coachman drive hither.</p>

<p>Not upon a kind Occasion, Madam. But when a Lady comes tyrannically to insult a ruin'd Lover, and make manifest the cruel Triumphs of her Beauty, the Barbarity of it something surprizes me.</p>

<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>How d'ye mean, mad?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Why faith, Madam, he's mad for want of his Wits, just as he was poor for want of Mony; his Head is e'en as light as his Pockets; and any body that has a mind to a bad Bargain, can't do better than to beg him for his Estate.</p>

<p>Faith, Madam, I wish telling a Lie would mend the matter. But this is no new Effect of an unsuccessful Passion.</p>

<p>Ha! I saw him wink and smile—I fancy 'tis a Trick—I'll try—I would disguise to all the World a Failing, which I must own to you—I fear my Happiness depends upon the Recovery of <hi>Valentine.</hi> Therefore I conjure you, as you are his Friend, and as you have Compassion upon one fearful of Affliction, to tell me what I am to hope for—I cannot speak—But you may tell me, tell me, for you know what I would ask?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>So, this is pretty plain—Be not too much concerned, Madam; I hope his Condition is not desperate: An Acknowledgment of Love from you, perhaps, may work a Cure; as the Fear of your Aversion occasion'd his Distemper.</p>

<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p><stage>aside.]</stage> Say you so; nay then I'm convinc'd: And if I don't play Trick for Trick, may I never taste the pleasure of Revenge.—Acknowledgment of Love! I find you have mistaken my Compassion, and think me guilty of a Weakness I am a Stranger to. But I have too much Sincerity to deceive you, and too much Charity to suffer him to be deluded with vain Hopes. Good Nature and Humanity oblige me to be concern'd for him; but to Love is neither in my Power nor Inclination: And if he can't be cur'd without I suck the Poison from his Wounds, I'm afraid he won't recover his Senses 'till I lose mine.</p>

<p>So, Faith good Nature works apace; you were confessing just now an Obligation to his Love.</p>

<p>We are all under a Mistake—Ask no Questions, for I can't resolve you, but I'll inform your Master.

<p>Tell, Madam! alas you don't know me—I have much ado to tell your Ladyship how long I have been in Love with you—but encourag'd by the Impossibility of <hi>Valentine's</hi> making any more Addresses to you, I have ventur'd to declare the very inmost Passion of my Heart. Oh, Madam, look upon us both. There you see the Ruins of a poor decay'd Creature—Here a compleat and lively Figure, with Youth and Health, and all his Five Senses in Perfection, Madam, and to all this, the most passionate Lover—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>O fie for shame, hold your Tongue, a passionate Lover, and Five Senses in Perfection! When you are as mad as <hi>Valentine,</hi> I'll believe you love me, and the maddest shall take me.</p>

<p>Look you, Mr. <hi>Foresight,</hi> it is not my way to make many Words of Matters, and so I shan't say much,—But in short, d'ye see, I will hold you a Hundred Pound now, that I know more Secrets then he.</p>

<p>Why, d'ye think I'll tell you, Sir! Read it in my Face? No, Sir, 'tis written in my Heart. And safer there, Sir, than Letters writ in Juice of Lemon, for no Fire can fetch it out. I am no Blab, Sir.</p>

<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>You're a Woman,—One to whom Heav'n gave Beauty, when it grafted Roses on a Briar. You are the Reflection of Heaven in a Pond, and he that leaps at you is sunk. You are all white, a sheet of lovely spotless Paper, when you first are Born; but you are to be scrawl'd and blotted by every Goose's Quill. I know you; for I lov'd a Woman, and lov'd her so long, that I found out a strange thing: I found out what a Woman was good for.</p>

<p>You see what Disguises Love makes us put on; Gods have been in counterfeited Shapes for the same Reason; and the Divine Part of me, my Mind, has worn this Mask of Madness, and this motly Livery, only as the Slave of Love, and menial Creature of your Beauty.</p>

<stage>[Sighs.</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>What sad Effects?—What's too late? My seeming Madness as deceiv'd my Father, and procur'd me Time to think of Means to reconcile me to him, and preserve the Right of my Inheritance to his Estate; which otherwise by Articles I must this morning have resign'd: And this I had inform'd you of to Day, but you were gone, before I knew you had been here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>How! I thought your Love of me had caus'd this Transport in your Soul; which it seems you only counterfeited, for by mercenary Ends, and sordid Interest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Nay, now you do me wrong; for if any Interest was considered, it was yours; since I thought I wanted more than Love, to make me worthy of you.</p>

<p>Sot, can't you apprehend?</p>

<p>Yes, Madam; he has Intervals: But you see he begins to look wild again now.</p>

</sp>

<p>Partly, I think—for he does not know his Mind two Hours—I'm sure I left him just now in a Humour to be mad, and I think I have not found him very quiet at this present. Who's there?</p>

<p>I did not think you had Apprehension enough to be exceptious: But Madmen shew themselves most, by over-pretending to a sound Understanding; as Drunken Men do by over-acting Sobriety; I was half inclining to believe you, 'till I accidentally touch'd upon your tender Part: But now you have restor'd me to my former Opinion and Compassion.</p>

<p>Would any thing but a Madman complain of Uncertainty?
<pb n="64" facs="74"/>
Uncertainty and Expectation are the Joys of Life. Security is an insipid thing, and the overtaking and possessing of a Wish discovers the Folly of the Chase. Never let us know one another better; for the Pleasure of a Masquerade is done, when we come to shew Faces: But I'll tell you two things before I leave you; I am not the Fool you take me for; and you are mad, and don't know it:</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>What, is the Lady gone again, Sir? I hope you understood one another before she went?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Understood! she is harder to be understood than a Piece of <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Antiquity, or an <hi>Irish</hi> Manuscript; you may pore 'till you spoil your Eyes, and not improve your Knowledge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>I have heard 'em say, Sir, they read hard <hi>Hebrew</hi> Books backwards; may be you begin to read at the wrong End.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>They say so of a Witches Prayer, and Dreams and <hi>Dutch</hi> Almanacks are to be understood by contraries. But there's Regularity and Method in that; she is a Medal without a Reverse or Inscription; for Indifference has both Sides alike. Yet while she does not seem to hate me, I will pursue her, and know her if it be possible, in spight of the Opinion of my Satyrical Friend, <hi>Scandal,</hi> who says,</p>
<l>That Women are like Tricks by Slight of Hand,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Why, you have no great reason to complain, Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> that is not long ago.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Zooks, but it is, Madam, a very great while, to a Man that admires a Fine Woman as much as I do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>You're an absolute Courtier, Sir <hi>Sampson.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Not at all, Madam: Odsbud you wrong me; I am not so old neither, to be a bare Courtier, only a Man of Words: Odd, I have warm Blood about me yet, and can serve a Lady any way—Come, come, let me tell you, you Women think a Man old too soon, Faith and Troth you do—Come, don't despise Fifty; odd Fifty, in a hale Constitution, is no such contemptible Age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Fifty a contemptible Age! Not at all, a very fashionable Age, I think—I assure you, I know very considerable Beaus, that set a good Face upon Fifty; Fifty! I have seen Fifty in a Side-Box by Candle-light out-blossom Five and Twenty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>O Pox, Outsides, Outsides; a pize take 'em, meer Outsides: Hang your Side-Box Beaus; no, I'm none of those, none of your forc'd Trees, that pretend to Blossom in the Fall, and Bud when they should bring forth Fruit: I am of a long liv'd Race, and inherit Vigour, none of my Family married 'till Fifty; yet they begot Sons and Daughters 'till Fourscorce: I am of your Patriarchs, I, a Branch of one of your <hi>Antideluvian</hi> Families, Fellows that the Flood could not wash away: Well, Madam, what are your Commands? Has any young Rogue affronted you, and shall I cut his Throat? or—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> I have no Quarrel upon my Hands—I have more occasion for your Conduct than your Courage at this time. To tell you the Truth, I'm weary of living single, and want a Husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Odsbud, and 'tis pity you should—Odd, wou'd she wou'd like me, then I should hamper my young Rogues: Odd,
<pb n="66" facs="76"/>
wou'd she wou'd; Faith and Troth she's devilish Handsom. 
<stage>[Aside.</stage> Madam, you deserve a good Husband, and 'twere a pity you should be thrown away upon any of these young idle Rogues about the Town. Odd, there's ne'er a young Fellow worth hanging,—that is a very young Fellow—Pize on 'em, they never think beforehand of any thing;—And if they commit Matrimony, 'tis as they commit Murder, out of a Frolick: And are ready to hang themselves, or to be hang'd by the Law, the next Morning:—Odso, have a care, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Therefore I ask your Advice, Sir <hi>Sampson:</hi> I have Fortune enough to make any Man easie that I can like; if there were such a thing as a young agreeable Man, with a reasonable Stock of good Nature and Sense—For I would neither have an absolute Wit, nor a Fool.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Odd, you are hard to please, Madam; to find a young Fellow that is neither a Wit in his own Eye, nor a Fool in the Eye of the World, is a very hard Task. But, Faith and Troth, you speak very discreetly; for I hate both a Wit and a Fool.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>She that marries a Fool, Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> commits the Reputation of her Honesty or Understanding to the Censure of the World: And she that marries a very witty Man, submits both to the Severity and insolent Conduct of her Husband. I should like a Man of Wit for a Lover, because I would have such an one in my Power; but I would no more be his Wife than his Enemy. For his Malice is not a more terrible Consequence of his Aversion, than his Jealousie is of his Love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>None of old <hi>Foresight</hi>'s <hi>Sybills</hi> ever utter'd such a Truth. Odsbud, you have won my Heart: I hate a Wit; I had a Son that was spoil'd among 'em; a good hopeful Lad, 'till he learn'd to be a Wit—And might have risen in the State—But, a Pox on't, his Wit run him out of his Mony, and now his Poverty has run him out of his Wits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> as your Friend, I must tell you, you are very much abus'd in that matter; he's no more mad than you are.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>How, Madam! Would I could prove it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>I can tell you how that may be done—But it is a thing that would make me appear to be too much concern'd in your Affairs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Odsbud, I believe she likes me—
<stage>[Aside.]</stage>—Ah, Madam, all my Affairs are scarce worthy to be laid at your Feet; and I wish, Madam, they stood in a better Posture, that I might make a more becoming Offer to a Lady of your incomparable
<pb n="67" facs="77"/>
Beauty and Merit.—If I had <hi>Peru</hi> in one Hand, and <hi>Mexico</hi> in t'other, and the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire under my Feet, it would make me only a more glorious Victim to be offer'd at the Shrine of your Beauty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Bless me, Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> what's the matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Odd, Madam, I love you—And if you would take my Advice in a Husband—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Hold, hold, Sir <hi>Sampson.</hi> I ask'd your Advice for a Husband, and you are giving me your Consent—I was indeed thinking to propose something like it in Jest, to satisfie you about <hi>Valentine:</hi> For if a Match were seemingly carried on between you and me, it would oblige him to throw off his Disguise of Madness, in apprehension of losing me: For you know he has long pretended a Passion for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Gadzooks, a most ingenious Contrivance—If we were to go throw with it. But why must the Match only be seemingly carried on?—Odd, let it be a real Contract.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>O fie, Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> what would the World say?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Say, they would say you were a wise Woman, and I a happy Man. Odd, Madam, I'll love you as long as I live; and leave you a good Jointure when I die.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Ay; but that is not in your Power, Sir <hi>Sampson;</hi> for when <hi>Valentine</hi> confesses himself in his Senses, he must make over his Inheritance to his younger Brother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Odd, you're cunning, a wary Baggage! Faith and Troth I like you the better—But, I warrant you, I have a Proviso in the Obligation in Favour of my self—Body o'me, I have a Trick to turn the Settlement upon the Issue Male of our two Bodies begotten. Odsbud, let us find Children, and I'll find an Estate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Will you? well, do you find the Estate, and leave the t'other to me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>O Rogue! But I'll trust you. And will you consent? Is it a Match then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Let me consult my Lawyer concerning this Obligation; and if I find what you propose practicable, I'll give you my Answer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>With all my Heart;—Come in with me, and I'll lend you the Bond,—You shall consult your Lawyer, and I'll consult a Parson; Odzooks I'm a young Man: Odzooks I'm a young Man, and I'll make it appear—Odd, you're devilish Handsom: Faith and Troth you're very Handsom, and I'm very
<pb n="68" facs="78"/>
Young, and very Lusty—Odsbud, Hussy, you know how to chuse, and so do I;—Odd, I think we are very well met;—Give me your Hand, Odd let me kiss it; 'tis as warm and as soft—as what?—Odd, as t'other Hand—give me t'other Hand, and I'll mumble 'em, and kiss 'em 'till they melt in my Mouth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Hold, Sir <hi>Sampson</hi>—You're profuse of your Vigor before your time: You'll spend your Estate before you come to it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>No, no, only give you a Rent-roll of my Possessions—Ah! Baggage—I warrant you; for little <hi>Sampson:</hi> Odd, <hi>Sampson</hi>'s a very good Name for an able Fellow: Your <hi>Sampsons</hi> were strong Dogs from the Beginning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Have a care, and don't over-act your Part—If you remember, the strongest <hi>Sampson</hi> of your Name pull'd an old House over his Head at last.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Say you so, Hussy?—Come, let's go then; Odd, I long to be pulling down too, come away—Odso, here's some Body coming.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Is not that she, gone out just now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir, she's just going to the Place of Appointment. Ah, Sir, if you are not very faithful and close in this Business, you'll certainly be the Death of a Person that has a most extraordinary Passion for your Honour's Service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Ay, who's that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Even my unworthy self, Sir—Sir, I have had an Appetite to be fed with your Commands a great while;—And now, Sir, my former Master having much troubled the Fountain of his Understanding, it is a very plausible Occasion for me to quench my Thirst at the Spring of your Bounty—I thought I could not recommend my self better to you, Sir, than by the delivery of a great Beauty and Fortune into your Arms, whom I have heard you sigh for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>I'll make thy Fortune; say no more—Thou art a pretty Fellow, and can'st carry a Message to a Lady in a pretty soft kind of Phrase, and with a good persuading Accent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I have the Seeds of Rhetorick and Oratory in my Head—I have been at <hi>Cambridge.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Ay; 'tis well enough for a Servant to be bred at an University: But the Education is a little too Pedantick for a Gentleman. I hope you are secret in your Nature, private, close, ha?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="69" facs="79"/>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>O Sir, for that, Sir, 'tis my chief Talent; I'm as secret as the Head of <hi>Nilus.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Hye? Who's he, tho'? A Privy-Counsellor?</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Close Dog! A good Whoremaster, I warrant him—The Time draws nigh, <hi>Jeremy. Angelica</hi> will be veil'd like a Nun; and I must be hooded like a Friar; ha, <hi>Jeremy?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir, hooded like a Hawk, to seize at first sight upon the Quarry. It is the Whim of my Master's Madness to be so dress'd; and she is so in Love with him, she'll comply with any thing to please him. Poor Lady, I'm sure she'll have reason to pray for me, when she finds what a happy Exchange she has made, between a Madman and so Accomplish'd a Gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Ay Faith, so she will, <hi>Jeremy:</hi> You're a good Friend to her, poor Creature—I swear I do it hardly so much in Consideration of my self, as Compassion to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>'Tis an Act of Charity, Sir, to save a fine Woman with Thirty Thousand Pound, from throwing her self away.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>So 'tis, faith—I might have sav'd several others in my time; but I Gad I could never find in my Heart to Marry any body before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir, I'll go and tell her my Master's coming; and meet you in half a quarter of an Hour, with your Disguise, at your own Lodgings. You must talk a little madly, she won't distinguish the Tone of your Voice.</p>

<p>O Mr. <hi>Tattle,</hi> are you here! I'm glad I have found you; I have been looking up and down for you like any thing, 'till I'm as tired as any thing in the World.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>O Pox how shall I get rid of this foolish Girl? 
<stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>O I have pure News, I can tell you pure News—I must not marry the Seaman now—my Father says so. Why won't you be my Husband? You say you love me, and you won't be my Husband. And I know you may be my Husband now if you please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>O fie, Miss: Who told you so, Child?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>Why, my Father—I told him that you lov'd me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>O fie, Miss; why did you do so? And who told you so, Child?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="70" facs="80"/>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>Who? Why you did; did not you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>O Pox, that was Yesterday, Miss; that was a great while ago, Child. I have been asleep since; slept a whole Night, and did not so much as dream of the matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw, O but I dream'd that it was so tho'.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but your Father will tell you that Dreams come by Contraries, Child—O fie; what, we must not love one another now—Pshaw, that would be a foolish thing indeed—Fie, fie, you are a Woman now, and must think of a new Man every Morning, and forget him every Night—No, no, to marry is to be a Child again, and play with the same Rattle always: O fie, Marrying is a paw thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>Well, but don't you love me as well as you did last Night then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>No, no, Child, you would not have me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>No? Yes but I would tho'.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw, but I tell you, you would not—You forget you're a Woman, and don't know your own Mind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>But here's my Father, and he knows my Mind.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Foresight.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>O, Mr. <hi>Tattle,</hi> your Servant, you are a close Man; but methinks your Love to my Daughter was a Secret I might have been trusted with,—Or had you a mind to try if I could discover it by my Art—hum, ha! I think there is something in your Physiognomy, that has a Resemblance of her; and the Girl is like me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>And so you would infer, that you and I are alike—what does the old Prig mean? I'll banter him, and laugh at him, and leave him. 
<stage>[aside.]</stage> I fancy you have a wrong Notion of Faces.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>How? What? A wrong Notion! How so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>In the way of Art: I have some taking Features, not obvious to Vulgar Eyes, that are Indications of a sudden turn of good Fortune, in the Lottery of Wives; and Promise of great Beauty and great Fortune reserv'd alone for me, by a private Intrigue of Destiny, kept secret from the piercing Eye of Perspicuity; from all Astrologers, and the Stars themselves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>How! I will make it appear, that what you say is impossible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I beg your Pardon, I'm in haste—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>For what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>To be married, Sir, married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but pray take me along with you, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="71" facs="81"/>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, 'tis to be done privately—I never make Confidents.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Well; but my Consent I mean—You won't marry my Daughter without my Consent?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Who I, Sir? I'm an absolute Stranger to you and your Daughter, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Hey day! What time of the Moon is this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Very true, Sir, and desire to continue so. I have no more Love for your Daughter, than I have Likeness of you; and I have a Secret in my Heart, which you would be glad to know, and shan't know; and yet you shall know it too, and be sorry for't afterwards. I'd have you to know, Sir, that I am as knowing as the Stars, and as secret as the Night. And I'm going to be married just now, yet did not know of it half an Hour ago; and the Lady stays for me, and does not know of it yet—There's a Mystery for you,—I know you love to untie Difficulties—Or if you can't solve this, stay here a quarter of an Hour, and I'll come and explain it to you.</p>

<p>O Father, why will you let him go? Won't you make him to be my Husband?</p>

<p>Mercy on us, what do these Lunacies portend? Alas! he's mad, Child, stark wild.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss.</speaker>
<p>What, and must not I have e'er a Husband then? What, must I go to Bed to Nurse again, and be a Child as long as she's an Old Woman? Indeed but I won't: For now my Mind is set upon a Man, I will have a Man some way or other. Oh! methinks I'm sick when I think of a Man; and if I can't have one, I would go to sleep all my Life: For when I'm awake, it makes me wish and long, and I don't know for what—And I'd rather be always asleep, than sick with Thinking.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>O fearful! I think the Girl's influenc'd too,—Hussie, you shall have a Rod.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>A Fiddle of a Rod, I'll have a Husband; and if you won't get me one, I'll get one for my self: I'll marry our <hi>Robbin</hi> the Buttler, he says he loves me, and he's a Handsom Man, and shall be my Husband: I warrant he'll be my Husband and thank me too, for he told me so.</p>

<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>O, Sir, the most unlucky Accident!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>What's the matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>O, the two most unfortunate poor Creatures in the World we are.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Bless us! How so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi> and I, poor Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi> and I are—I can't speak it out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Nor I—But poor Mrs. <hi>Frail</hi> and I are—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>Married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>Married! How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Suddenly—before we know where we were—that Villain <hi>Jeremy,</hi> by the help of Disguises, trick'd us into one another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Why, you told me just now, you went hence in haste to be married.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>But I believe Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi> meant the Favour to me, I thank him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>I did, as I hope to be sav'd, Madam, my Intentions were good—But this is the most cruel thing, to marry one does not know how, nor why, nor wherefore—The Devil take me if ever I was so much concern'd at any thing in my Life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="75" facs="85"/>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>'Tis very unhappy, if you don't care for one another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>The least in the World—That is for my Part, I speak for my self. Gad, I never had the least thought of serious Kindness—I never lik'd any Body less in my Life. Poor Woman! Gad I'm sorry for her too; for I have no reason to hate her neither; but I believe I shall lead her a damn'd sort of a Life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Fore.</speaker>
<p>He's better than no Husband at all—tho' he's a Coxcomb.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p><stage>to her.]</stage> Ay, ay, it's well it's no worse—Nay, for my part I always despis'd Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi> of all things; nothing but his being my Husband could have made me like him less.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Look you there, I thought as much—Pox on't, I wish we could keep it secret, why I don't believe any of this Company would speak of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frail.</speaker>
<p>But, my Dear, that's impossible; the Parson and that Rogue <hi>Jeremy</hi> will publish it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Ay, my Dear, so they will, as you say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>O you'll agree very well in a little time; Custom will make it easie to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>Easie! Pox on't, I don't believe I shall Sleep to Night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Sleep Quotha! No, why you would not Sleep o'your Wedding Night? I'm an older Fellow than you, and don't mean to Sleep.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Why there's another Match now, as tho'f a couple of Privateers were looking for a Prize, and should fall foul of one another. I'm sorry for the Young Man with all my Heart. Look you, Friend, if I may advise you, when she's going, for that you must expect, I have Experience of her, when she's going, let her go. For no Matrimony is tough enough to hold her, and if she can't drag her Anchor along with her, she'll break her Cable, I can tell you that. Who's here? the Madman?</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Valentine</hi> dress'd, <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Jeremy.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>No, here's the Fool; and if occasion be, I'll give it under my Hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>How now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I'm come to acknowledge my Errors, and ask your Pardon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>What have you found your Senses at last then? In good time, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>You were abus'd, Sir, I never was distracted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>How! Not Mad! Mr. <hi>Scandal?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>No really, Sir; I'm his Witness, it was all Counterfeit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="76" facs="86"/>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I thought I had Reasons—But it was a poor Contrivance, the Effect has shewn it such.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Contrivance, what to cheat me? to cheat your Father! Sirrah, could you hope to prosper?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, I thought, Sir, when the Father endeavour'd to undo the Son, it was a reasonable return of Nature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Very good, Sir—Mr. <hi>Buckram,</hi> are you ready?—Come, Sir, will you Sign and Seal?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>If you please, Sir; but first I would ask this Lady one Question.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Sir, you must ask me leave first; that Lady, no, Sir; you shall ask that Lady no Questions, 'till you have ask'd her Blessing, Sir; that Lady is to be my Wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I have heard as much, Sir; but I would have it from her own Mouth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>That's as much as to say I lie, Sir, and you don't believe what I say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, Sir. But I reflect that I very lately counterfeited Madness; I don't know but the Frolick may go round.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Come, Chuck, satisfie him, answer him;—Come, come, Mr. <hi>Buckram,</hi> the Pen and Ink.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buck.</speaker>
<p>Here it is, Sir, with the Deed, all is ready.</p>
<stage>[<hi>Val.</hi> goes to <hi>Ang.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>'Tis true, you have a great while pretended Love to me; nay, what if you were sincere? Still you must Pardon me, if I think my own Inclinations have a better Right to dispose of my Person, than yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Are you answer'd now, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Where's your Plot, Sir? And your Contrivance now, Sir? Will you Sign, Sir? Come, will you Sign and Seal?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>With all my Heart, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>'Sdeath, you are not Mad indeed, to ruin your self?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I have been disappointed of my only Hope; and he that loses Hope may part with any thing. I never valu'd Fortune, but as it was subservient to my Pleasure; and my only Pleasure was to please this Lady: I have made many vain Attemps, and find at last that nothing but my Ruin can effect it: Which, for that Reason, I will Sign to—Give me the Paper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Generous <hi>Valentine!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buck.</speaker>
<p>Here is the Deed, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>But where is the Bond, by which I am oblig'd to Sign this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="77" facs="87"/>
<speaker>Buck.</speaker>
<p>Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> you have it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>No, I have it; and I'll use it, as I would every thing that is an Enemy to <hi>Valentine.</hi></p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>How now!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Had I the World to give you, it could not make me worthy of so generous and faithful a Passion: Here's my Hand, my Heart was always yours, and struggl'd very hard to make this utmost Trial of your Virtue. 
<stage>[To <hi>Val.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Between Pleasure and Amazement I am lost—But on my Knees I take the Blessing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Oons, what is the meaning of this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p>Mess here's the Wind chang'd again. Father, you and I may make a Voyage together now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> since I have plaid you a Trick, I'll advise you, how you may avoid such another. Learn to be a good Father, or you'll never get a second Wife. I always lov'd your Son, and hated your unforgiving Nature. I was resolv'd to try him to the utmost; I have try'd you too, and know you both. You have not more Faults than he has Virtues; and 'tis hardly more Pleasure to me, that I can make him and my self happy, than that I can punish you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>If my Happiness could receive Addition, this kind Surprize would make it double.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>Oons you're a <hi>Crocodile.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fore.</speaker>
<p>Really, Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> this is a sudden Eclipse—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
<p>You're an illiterate Fool, and I'm another, and the Stars are Liars; and if I had Breath enough, I'd curse them and you, my self and every Body—Oons, Cully'd, Bubbl'd, Jilted, Woman-bobb'd at last, I have not Patience.</p>
<stage>[Exit Sir <hi>Samp.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tatt.</speaker>
<p>If the Gentleman is in this Disorder for want of a Wife, I can spare him mine. Oh, are you there, Sir? I'm indebted to you for my Happiness. 
<stage>[To <hi>Jere.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jere.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I ask you Ten Thousand Pardons, 'twas an errant Mistake—You see, Sir, my Master was never mad, nor any thing like it—Then how could it be otherwise?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p><hi>Tattle,</hi> I thank you; you would have interposed between me and Heav'n, but Providence laid Purgatory in your way—You have but Justice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>I hear the Fiddles that Sir <hi>Sampson</hi> provided for his own Wedding; methinks 'tis pity they should not be employ'd when the Match is so much mended. <hi>Valentine,</hi> tho' it be Morning, we may have a Dance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="78" facs="88"/>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Any thing, my Friend, every thing that looks like Joy and Transport.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Call 'em, <hi>Jeremy.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>I have done dissembling now, <hi>Valentine;</hi> and if that Coldness which I have always worn before you, should turn to an extream Fondness, you must not suspect it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I'll prevent that Suspicion—For I intend to doat on at that immoderate rate, that your Fondness shall never distinguish it self enough to be taken notice of. If ever you seem to love too much, it must be only when I can't love enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>Have a care of Promises: You know you are apt to run more in Debt than you are able to pay.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Therefore I yield my Body as your Prisoner, and make your best on't.</p>

<stage>[Dance.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scan.</speaker>
<p>Well, Madam, you have done Exemplary Justice, in punishing an inhuman Father, and rewarding a faithful Lover: But there is a third good Work, which I, in particular, must thank you for; I was an Infidel to your Sex, and you have converted me—For now I am convinc'd that all Women are not like Fortune, blind in bestowing Favours, either to those who do not merit, or who do not want 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<p>'Tis an unreasonable Accusation, that you lay upon our Sex: You tax us with Injustice, only to cover your own want of Merit. You would all have the Reward of Love, but few have the Constancy to stay 'till it becomes your due. Men are generally Hypocrites and Infidels, they pretend to Worship, but have neither Zeal nor Faith: How few, like <hi>Valentine,</hi> would perserve even unto Martyrdom, and sacrifice their Interest to their Constancy! In admiring me, you misplace the Novelty.</p>
<l>The Miracle to Day is, that we find</l>
<l>A Lover true: Not that a Woman's kind.</l>
