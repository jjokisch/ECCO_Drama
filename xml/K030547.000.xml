<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by MR. HENDERSON.</stage>
<l>TO holy land in superstition's day,</l>
<l>When bare foot pilgrims trode their weary way,</l>
<l>By mother church's unremitting law</l>
<l>Scourg'd into grace, with shoulders red and raw;</l>
<l>Kneeling demure before the sacred shrine,</l>
<l>On the hard flint they begg'd the boon divine;</l>
<l>Pardon for what offending flesh had done,</l>
<l>And pity for the long long course they'd run,</l>
<l>Fines, pains and penalties, securely past,</l>
<l>Slow pac'd forgiveness met their prayer at last,</l>
<l>Full absolution from conceeding Rome,</l>
<l>Cancell'd all sin, past, present and to come.</l>
<l>Your Poet thus prophanely led aside</l>
<l>To range o'er Tragic land without a guide,</l>
<l>To pick perhaps, with no invidious aim,</l>
<l>A few cast fallings from the tree of fame.</l>
<l>Damn'd, tho' untried, by the despotic rule</l>
<l>Of the stern Doctors in detraction's school;</l>
<l>Lash'd down each column of a public page,</l>
<l>And driv'n o'er burning ploughshares to the stage,</l>
<l>Be rhim'd, be ridicul'd with doggrel wit,</l>
<l>Sues out a pardon from his Pope—<hi>the Pit.</hi></l>
<l>Pensive he stands in penitential weeds,</l>
<l>With a huge rosary of untold beads;</l>
<l>Sentenc'd for past offences to rehearse,</l>
<l><hi>Ave Apollo's</hi> to the God of verse;</l>
<l>And sure there's no one but an Author knows</l>
<l>The Penance, which an Author undergoes.</l>
<l>If then your worships a few stripes award</l>
<l>Let not your beadles lay them on too hard;</l>
<l>For in the world there's not a thing so thin,</l>
<l>So full of feeling, as your Poet's skin:</l>
<l>What if, perchance, he snatch'd a playful kiss</l>
<l>From that free hearted romp the Comic Miss;</l>
<l>That frolick's past, he's turn'd to years of grace,</l>
<l>And a young sinner now supplies his place.</l>
<l>Sure you'll not grudge a little sober chat</l>
<l>With this demure old tabby Tragic cat;</l>
<l>No charge lies here of conversation crim</l>
<l>He hopes you'll think her fame, no worse for him.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by MISS YOUNGE.</stage>
<l>FROM ancient Thespis to the present age</l>
<l>The world hath oft been term'd a public stage,</l>
<l>A thread-bare metaphor, which in its time</l>
<l>Hath patch'd much prose and heel-piec'd many a rhime;</l>
<l>Ev'n the grave pulpit sometimes <hi>deigns</hi> to use</l>
<l>The emphatic terms of the proscribed Muse,</l>
<l>Calls birth our entry, death our exit calls,</l>
<l>And at life's close exclaims—the curtain falls;</l>
<l>And so concludes upon the drama's plan</l>
<l>That fretting, strutting, short-hour actor, man.</l>
<l><hi>Are we all actors then?</hi>—yes, all from Adam,</l>
<l><hi>And actresses?</hi>—I apprehend so Madam.</l>
<l>Some fill their cast with grace, others with none,</l>
<l>Some are shov'd off the stage, and some shov'd on;</l>
<l>Some good, some bad, still we all act a part,</l>
<l>Whilst we disguise the language of the heart;</l>
<l>Nature's plain taste provides a simple treat,</l>
<l>But art, the <hi>Cook,</hi> steps in and mars the meat;</l>
<l>The comic blade makes ridicule his test,</l>
<l>And on his tomb proclaims that life's a jest,</l>
<l>The swaggering braggart, in true tragic cast,</l>
<l>Bellows blank verse and daggers to the last;</l>
<l>Whilst clubs of neutral petit-maitres boast</l>
<l>A kind of opera company at most,</l>
<l>Whose dress, air, action, all is imitation,</l>
<l>A poor, insipid, servile, French translation;</l>
<l>Whose tame dull scene glides uniform along,</l>
<l>In comi—farei—pastoral—sing—song—</l>
<l>'Till all awaken'd by the rattling die</l>
<l>Club wits, and make—a modern tragedy;</l>
<l>A tragedy alas! good friends, look round,</l>
<l>What have we left to tread but tragic ground?</l>
<l>Four authors leagu'd to shake the human soul,</l>
<l>Unsheath the dagger, and infuse the bowl,</l>
<l>At length descending to the least, and last,</l>
<l>We hope the terror of the time is past,</l>
<l>Full sated now with battle, blood, and murder,</l>
<l>England is conquer'd—fate can reach no further,</l>
<l>Bid then the weeping <hi>Pleiads</hi> dry their eyes,</l>
<l>And turn to happier scenes and brighter skies.</l>

<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>Hah! in very truth</l>

<l>I must believe thee;</l>
<l>The more I'm lost in wonder: but confess,</l>

<l>Thou may'st reveal thy thoughts.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RAYMOND.</speaker>
<l>Nay, good my Lord,</l>
<l>My thoughts are little worth.</l>

<l>Yes, Raymond, she is fair; Heaven for the sins</l>

<l>Oh, I had treasur'd up such thoughts!—But mark,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Not for the world; no, if we meet again,</l>

<l>Before the lark her shrill-ton'd matins sings,</l>
<l>Or morning issues from the nuptial east,</l>
<l>And to the bosoms of the nursing hours</l>

<l>Yes, but my love, like never-ending time,</l>

<l>The poet by the magic of his song</l>
<l>Can charm the list'ning moon, ascend the spheres,</l>

<l>A brother's curse!</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>You abuse</l>

<l>The tenderest flower that withers at the breeze,</l>
<l>Or, if the amorous sun but steal a kiss,</l>

<stage>As <hi>EDWIN</hi> is going out, Lord <hi>WALTHEOF,</hi> who had waited in the back scene, calls to him.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Turn, noble Edwin; look upon a friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>A friend, Lord Waltheof?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Have you then forgot</l>
<l>How oft in early youth on Avon's banks</l>
<l>We wak'd the echoes with our rural sports?</l>
<l>Have you forgot our mutual binding oath</l>
<l>To royal Edgar's cause? Ev'n now my heart</l>
<l>True to its former fires expanded swells</l>
<l>And labours with a second birth of love.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Where was your oath on that lamented day,</l>
<l>When Severn's stream ran purple with the blood</l>
<l>Of Edgar's murder'd friends? Where was your love,</l>
<l>When at the side of stern Northumberland</l>
<l>You frown'd defiance at me? Art thou not</l>
<l><pb n="29" facs="33"/>The veriest courtier that ere pag'd the heels</l>
<l>Of pride-swoln majesty?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Were I the wretch,</l>
<l>So supple to ambition's sordid use,</l>
<l>So abject as thou mak'st me, what forbids</l>
<l>But I shou'd seize the lucky instant, fly</l>
<l>To the abus'd ear of the king and tell him—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>What wou'd'st thou tell him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>What! that Edmund is—</l>
<l>But for the world's worth I'll not damn my honour:</l>
<l>Live Edgar but till Waltheof shall betray him,</l>
<l>And he must be immortal.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Art thou faithful;</l>
<l>May I believe thee? Oh, if thou betray'st him</l>
<l>Hell hath not torments dire enough to plague thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Come I am in thy bosom—Learn a truth;</l>
<l>This young Minerva, whom our English Jove</l>
<l>Leads to his wars—Matilda—shall be Edgar's.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Come to my heart; I do believe thee loyal</l>
<l>And noble as I've known thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="30" facs="34"/>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Why she loves him</l>
<l>To fascination.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Art thou sure of that?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Have I sight, hearing, do I live and wake?</l>
<l>Her very soul is Edmund's.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Grant she loves,</l>
<l>Can we be sure that he returns her love?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Does the sun warm the bosom that he shines on?</l>
<l>So must her beauty Edgar: Mark my project—</l>
<l>The king to superstition much inclines;</l>
<l>Peering in musty prophecies and fables;</l>
<l>Consulting with astrologers and seers,</l>
<l>Diviners and interpreters of dreams,</l>
<l>Omens and prodigies.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>'Tis ever thus</l>
<l>When the mind's ill at ease.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>There is at hand</l>
<l>An ancient soothsayer of Scottish birth,</l>
<l>Duncan his name; ev'n such a man, so white</l>
<l>And reverend with age, as might impose</l>
<l><pb n="31" facs="35"/>Credulity upon the wariest; him,</l>
<l>By the enthusiastic monarch deem'd</l>
<l>Oracular, will I dispose to speak</l>
<l>Of Edgar and his right—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Break off; behold</l>
<l>The princess comes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Look, Edwin, what a form</l>
<l>Of pensive majesty: Mark'd you that sigh;</l>
<l>Those eyes, love's oracles? Poor stricken deer,</l>
<l>The shaft is in thy heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Let us withdraw.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt.</stage>
<stage><hi>MATILDA</hi> with her Attendants. A Guard.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Soldier, retire; your charge extends no further.</l>
<l>Sabina!</l>
</sp>
<stage>The Guard goes off.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SABINA.</speaker>
<l>What commands my gracious lady?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>You told me on the way you had a suit;</l>
<l>What can my faithful handmaids ask in vain?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="32" facs="36"/>
<speaker>SABINA.</speaker>
<l>'Tis for a stranger, not ourselves, we ask;</l>
<l>A virgin suitor of no vulgar mein,</l>
<l>But fair in speech and feature; one who bears</l>
<l>The port and semblance of illustrious birth,</l>
<l>Tho' sorrow-struck and waining with despair.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Have you denied her aught? ah, if you have▪</l>
<l>Or but demurr'd, me and yourselves you've wrong'd</l>
<l>And forfeited heav'n's love: What is her suit?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SABINA.</speaker>
<l>In these rude times protection and admission</l>
<l>Into our happy number.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Bring her to us.</l>
<stage>Exeunt all but Sabina.</stage>
<l>Sabina, stay; there's pity in thine eyes,</l>
<l>If this poor stranger can provoke these drops,</l>
<l>My griefs will drown thee quite.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SABINA.</speaker>
<l>Alas, what woud'st thou?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>What would I? be the poorest thing on earth,</l>
<l>Poorer than her whose miseries you weep for,</l>
<l>Be any thing, so I were free withal:</l>
<l>Then might I see him, wait upon him, watch</l>
<l>And pay him hourly worship. On our way</l>
<l><pb n="33" facs="37"/>As I did meet the king, and bent my knee,</l>
<l>As is my morning custom, why, Sabina,</l>
<l>When I discover'd standing at his side</l>
<l>Young Edmund's bright and blooming form before me,</l>
<l>Why did my heart, as with a sudden leap,</l>
<l>Spring to my trembling lips and stop my tongue,</l>
<l>That wou'd have beg'd a blessing? Every sense</l>
<l>Revolted from its office; my rapt soul</l>
<l>Fled at my eyes; I fainted, sunk and fell.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SABINA.</speaker>
<l>Ah fatal chance, that ever you shou'd see him!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Deeper and deeper sinks the mortal shaft;</l>
<l>My bosom's peace is lost. Once I was happy;</l>
<l>Clear and serene my life's calm current ran,</l>
<l>While scarce a breezy wish provok'd its tide;</l>
<l>Down the smooth flood the tuneful passions fell</l>
<l>In easy lapse and slumber'd as they pass'd.</l>
<l>Now what a change is wrought! O love, in age</l>
<l>Thou art indeed a child, in power a God.</l>
<l>How now, What stranger's this?</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>EDWINA</hi> enters, introduced by the Ladies of <hi>MATILDA</hi>'s train.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SABINA.</speaker>
<l>You have forgot,</l>
<l>The maid we spoke of.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Pray you pardon me—</l>
<l>Stranger, approach and fear not. I can see</l>
<l><pb n="34" facs="38"/>Thou art not us'd to ask, and yet thy looks</l>
<l>Plead most enforcingly: If thou dost need</l>
<l>Such shelter as these humble coverings give,</l>
<l>Here in the rear of danger thou may'st dwell,</l>
<l>And join thy prayers to our's.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWINA.</speaker>
<l>Thanks, noble lady.</l>
<l>In yon fair vale, while peace was there, I dwelt:</l>
<l>One only brother chear'd my orphan state,</l>
<l>And rich in flocks and herds serene we liv'd:</l>
<l>Him, the support and solace of my life,</l>
<l>Stern duty's iron hand hath wrested from me,</l>
<l>And somewhere in this mighty camp he wars.</l>
<l>What was for me deserted and forlorn?</l>
<l>With one old faithful servant forth I came,</l>
<l>Led slowly on thro' unfrequented paths</l>
<l>To her, whose fame is bruited thro' the land,</l>
<l>Whose gentleness and pity climb heav'n's court,</l>
<l>Like an accepted sacrifice.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>No more.</l>
<l>Praise undeserv'd, what is it but reproach?</l>
<l>(This maid wou'd seem less noble than she is)</l>
<stage>Aside.</stage>
<l>How must I call thee, stranger?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWINA.</speaker>
<l>Athelina.</l>
<l>(O heav'nly god of truth, be not extreme</l>
<l>With thine offending creature, but accept</l>
<l>Necessity my plea.)</l>
<stage>Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Fair Athelina,</l>
<l>Such welcome as these angry times allow,</l>
<l><pb n="35" facs="39"/>Freely thou hast: Ours is no life of ease;</l>
<l>We must awake before the morning dawn,</l>
<l>Or look to have our slumbers broke tomorrow,</l>
<l>When these vast armies which thou fee'st shall join,</l>
<l>Rending heav'n's concave with their rival shouts</l>
<l>In terrible confliction.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWINA.</speaker>
<l>Power supreme!</l>
<l>Whose word can bid the gathering clouds disperse,</l>
<l>Smooth the vext bosom of the furrow'd sea,</l>
<l>And chain the stubborn and contentious winds,</l>
<l>When they unseat the everlasting rocks</l>
<l>And cast them to the sky, wilt thou permit</l>
<l>Thy creature man thus to deface thy works?</l>
<l>Or is he stronger and in less controul</l>
<l>Than these fierce elements?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Banish complaint,</l>
<l>Take hope into thy heart, and every thought</l>
<l>Drive far away, that can infect the mind</l>
<l>With fear's unnerved ague. 'Tis the cause,</l>
<l>The cause, which sanctifies the warrior's zeal;</l>
<l>It is our country's just maternal claim</l>
<l>On all her sons to fight in her defence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWINA.</speaker>
<l>I will not whisper to the babbling winds</l>
<l>My ill-tim'd fears, but hush them in my breast,</l>
<l>And smile on sorrow, tho' my sad heart break.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Ah, am not I a woman like thyself?</l>
<l>Doth thy heart tremble for a brother's life,</l>
<l><pb n="36" facs="40"/>And shall a father's plant no cares in mine?</l>
<l>What hast thou more at stake, unless perchance</l>
<l>Thy flocks and herds in yon sequester'd vale,</l>
<l>Thy peaceful calm content outweighs a crown.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWINA.</speaker>
<l>Ah, Edmund, Edmund, why did'st thou forsake me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Whom dost thou name?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWINA.</speaker>
<l>I pray you pardon me,</l>
<l>The sad remembrance of an absent friend</l>
<l>Drew after it a short unheeded sigh,</l>
<l>The last which I will utter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Much I fear</l>
<l>Thou hast untold afflictions, secret griefs,</l>
<l>Which swell that bosom and provoke those sighs.</l>
<l>But, come, thy tender frame demands repose,</l>
<l>And these kind friends will lead thee to their tents.</l>
<l>Tomorrow, virgins, we must teach our throats</l>
<l>A loftier strain, and to the sounding harp</l>
<l>With songs of victory hail the rising morn.</l>

<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>LO, he hath dropt the curtain of his tent,</l>
<l>Which tokens privacy: Duncan is there;</l>
<l>I have arm'd the fiery zealot for the charge</l>
<l>With all the stars of heaven at his command,</l>
<l>To rouse the sleeping conscience of the king:</l>
<l>That done, my turn succeeds to mount the breach</l>

<l>Oh, speak,</l>

<l>Man of sin,</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>What is my sin?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DUNCAN.</speaker>

<l>Lives he and dost thou reign? Tho' thou shou'dst bribe</l>
<l>Legions of holy men to weary Heaven</l>
<l>Early and late with never-ceasing prayers,</l>
<l>Vain were their suit. Now mark me—All night long</l>
<l>From setting to the rising sun I watcht,</l>

<l>Heav'n grant thy prayers! say, what declare the signs?</l>

<speaker>DUNCAN.</speaker>
<l>Ev'n in that moment when the midnight sphere</l>
<l>Central was pois'd, and yesterday expir'd,</l>
<l>On the left shoulder of the northern bear</l>
<l>Thy natal star arose! rayless and dim</l>
<l>And watery pale the horoscope appear'd,</l>
<l>While from the threat'ning East the hostile Moon</l>
<l>Push'd thee with adverse horns, red-mailed Mars</l>
<l>Flam'd in his planetary house, and scoul'd</l>
<l>With stellar rage askaunt.</l>

<l>This is thy fruit, Ambition; thus it seems</l>

<l>When Halfager with his Norwegian bands,</l>
<l>And traitrous Tosti fell beneath our swords.</l>

<l>Atonement now</l>
<l>Is all his theme, and penitence for wrongs</l>
<l>To Edgar done.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Hence with such idle dreamers!</l>
<l>What are the visions of the cloyster'd monk,</l>
<l>The hermit's phrensy, or the coward calls</l>
<l>Of backning Conscience to ambition's charms?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Ambition's charms! Accursed be the hour</l>
<l>When first they caught my weak unwary heart!</l>
<l>Full in my view the stately phantom stood,</l>
<l>Her stature charm'd me and the dazling height</l>
<l>Fir'd my young blood! I sprung to her embrace;</l>
<l>The distance vanish'd and the steep ascent</l>
<l>Sunk at the touch; she with dissembling smiles</l>
<l>And meretricious glances met my joys;</l>
<l>Upon my head she plac'd a kingly crown;</l>
<l>But in the moment drew a ponyard forth,</l>
<l>And plung'd it in my heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Ah, who shall envy</l>
<l>Another's greatness; call another blest,</l>
<l>When thus a king complains?</l>
</sp>

<l>On too high matters—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>I conjure thee speak:</l>
<l>My doom is on thy lips; 'tis thou alone</l>
<l>That can'st expound my fate.</l>

<sp>

<l>Come to my bosom;</l>
<l>Thy voice to me is as the voice of heaven:</l>

<l>Nor a stone vollied from the slinger's arm</l>
<l>'Till Edgar shall be found.</l>

<l>Lo! he is found, I may both fight and conquer.</l>
<l>O Waltheof, I do surely think that God</l>

<l>Now in this awful interim, whilst dread</l>

<l>Oh let us bring the light of England forth!</l>
<l>So shines the day-star out, after rude storms</l>

<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Go! to thy charge, O Waltheof, I commit</l>

<l><pb n="47" facs="51"/>Of this ambitious man? Art thou right, sure</l>
<l>There's no dissimulation lurking there?</l>
<l>Swear to me this, as thou hast hope in heaven,</l>

<l>Edwin, thou'st been conferring with lord Waltheof;</l>
<l>That man hath eyes which penetrate the heart;</l>

<l>Wou'd I? just heav'n</l>

</sp>

<l>Go then, ye sons</l>

<l>A fairer courser to Apollo's car,</l>
<l>When with the zephyrs and the rosy hours</l>
<l>Thro' heav'n's bright portal he ascends the east,</l>

<l>LORD Waltheof, if thou hast not yet disclos'd</l>
<l>The royal youth, forbear, I do revoke</l>
<l>The word I gave thee.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Why, on what pretence?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Edgar commands it; he disclaims ambition</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>WALTHEOF.</speaker>
<l>Will not wed?</l>
<l>Edgar, the most forlorn lost thing on earth,</l>
<l>Not wed Matilda? Strengthen my belief,</l>

<speaker>EDWIN.</speaker>
<l>Restrain yourself, my lord; your rage transports you,</l>
<l>And yet to show I scorn a mean disguise,</l>
<l>I own, in bitterness of soul I own it,</l>
<l>Your charge in part is true; there is a maid,</l>

<l>Now if indeed thou art that loving friend</l>
<l>Of Edgar Atheling, which fame reports thee,</l>
<l>Lend me thy patient ear. Thou'rt not to learn,</l>
<l>How, when his grandsire good king Edmund died,</l>
<l>Our English nobles put him from his right;</l>
<l>And me a subject born, earl Goodwyn's son,</l>
<l>Call'd to the vacant throne; so call'd, of force</l>
<l>Obey'd I them, and by a king's best title,</l>
<l>My subjects free election, took the crown.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="59" facs="63"/>
<speaker>EDGAR.</speaker>
<l>And took you peace withal and fair content</l>
<l>And conscious rectitude? You took the crown!</l>
<l>So would not I, tho' it had brought dominion</l>
<l>Wide as the world. Have you sweet sleep at nights?</l>
<l>Do no ill-omen'd visions haunt your couch,</l>
<l>And smile the eyelids of the morn upon you,</l>
<l>When you salute the light?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Urge me no further:</l>
<l>I see thou'rt noble, and that manly plainness,</l>
<l>Which some wou'd shrink from, knits me closer to thee:</l>
<l>Nay I will own thou hast call'd up a thought,</l>
<l>Which like unweildy armour weighs me down.</l>
<l>I do perceive shame and remorse are handmaids,</l>
<l>That wait on guilt, as darkness on the night.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDGAR.</speaker>
<l>Methinks there needs no oracle for this;</l>
<l>To tell me man is cruel, false, ambitious,</l>
<l>Full of gross appetency and unjust,</l>
<l>Is to say man is man, a general truth,</l>
<l>To which your meanest centinel shall witness</l>
<l>As amply as myself: call in your camp,</l>
<l>Our conference needs no privacy; you say</l>
<l>Heaven goads the guilty breast, and well you say,</l>
<l>For goad it shall, or heav'n must not be heaven.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Give me thy patience: what thou yet hast heard,</l>
<l>Think but the prelude to more weighty matter.</l>
<l>I have a daughter—need I call her fair,</l>
<l>Virtuous and full of grace?—my realm's sole heiress:</l>
<l><pb n="60" facs="64"/>Her, in respect of his descended right,</l>
<l>Tho' fortune-wreckt and bankrupt ev'n in hope,</l>
<l>Edgar shall wed.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>EDGAR.</speaker>
<l>Shall wed?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Hah! dost thou pause?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDGAR.</speaker>
<l>No, if affection moves at thy command,</l>
<l>And love must follow where ambition points,</l>
<l>Edgar shall wed Matilda.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>This to me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDGAR.</speaker>
<l>But if love owns no law but of the heart;</l>
<l>And if perchance some humbler maid hath drawn</l>
<l>Such vows from Edgar's lips, as honour frames</l>
<l>And fond believing innocence admits,</l>
<l>Then—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>What then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDGAR.</speaker>
<l>Not upon the peopled earth,</l>
<l>No, nor above the clouds resides that power,</l>
<l>Can wrench the conscious witness from his heart,</l>
<l>And say to Edgar he shall wed Matilda.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="61" facs="65"/>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>What, shall a needy outlaw talk of love?</l>
<l>A beggar plead affections and reject</l>
<l>Her, to whom Europe's kings have knelt in vain?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDGAR.</speaker>
<l>Yes, for since beggars have aspir'd to crowns,</l>
<l>Kings have declin'd to beggars.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Hence, audacious,</l>
<l>Nor feign for Edgar, what were Edgar present</l>

<speaker>EDGAR.</speaker>
<l>Know then 'tis Edgar speaks, 'tis Atheling</l>

<l>Guards! arrest him.</l>

<l>Collect thy scatter'd thoughts; we yet are friends.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDGAR.</speaker>
<l>No, when I league with guilt and yield to fear</l>
<l>What honour shou'd withhold, heav'n shall meet hell,</l>

<l>Dost thou defy me? take back thy defiance,</l>

</sp>
<stage>As Harold is giving the signal to the guard for arresting Edgar, Matilda enters hastily.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Health to my father!</l>
<l>Why dart thine eyes such angry lightnings forth?</l>
<l>Why stand these guards like hounds upon the slip?</l>
<l>Is this their victim? ah! can he offend?</l>
<l>Never look'd guilt like him; he errs perhaps</l>
<l>And with too bold a speech affronts the ear</l>
<l>Of majesty; a stranger is not bound</l>
<l>To all a subject's forms: Let me prevail;</l>
<l>Send him aside and hear thy daughter speak.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>My daughter shall be heard; is there a thing</l>
<l>I ever yet denied thee? Lead him off,</l>
<l>And wait our pleasure. —Hah! that look hath language.</l>
<stage>As the guard lead off Edgar, Matilda looks tenderly at him.</stage>
<l>Matilda, know'st thou him thou dost survey</l>
<l>With such fond scrutiny?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="63" facs="67"/>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>You bade me know him,</l>

<l>And now what cause alas! provokes this change?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Thou art the cause; 'tis for thy sake he dies.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Die for my sake? Not if his death cou'd add</l>
<l>Myriads of years to my extended life,</l>
<l>And every year bring myriads of delights.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Thou wilt destroy him;</l>
<l>It is the savage policy of kings.</l>

<l>Then heaven cannot afflict thee deeper.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>I know it, but your daughter, Sir, can die:</l>
<l>I speak for nature; mine is not a heart,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Nay I am told</l>
<l>You are too proud to be Matilda's debtor,</l>

<l>And leave the choice of all mankind to her?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDGAR.</speaker>
<l>In rural silence dwells the maid I love,</l>
<l>With her in some lone corner of your isle,</l>
<l>Far from ambition's walk, let me reside,</l>
<l>Nor shake the quiet of Matilda's soul.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
<l>Sure of all forms, which cruelty assumes,</l>

<l>Away, nor cheat me with these fairy scenes;</l>
<l>There is no beauty in our isle for Edgar,</l>
<l>No soft sequester'd maid, no truth, no love,</l>
<l>Save what this fond rejected heart contains.</l>
</sp>

<l>Turn not, but as the galled panther turns,</l>
<l>To lick his wounds, and with recruited fury</l>
<l>Spring to the fight afresh: So turn; so stand!</l>
<l>And from this height, ennobled by your valour</l>
<l>Hurl bold defiance to the foe beneath.</l>
