<p>ENGLISH READINGS; A COMIC PIECE, IN ONE ACT.</p>
<p>INSCRIBED TO GEORGE COLMAN, ESQ.</p>
<p>LONDON: PRINTED FOR C. DILLY, IN THE POULTRY. M.DCC.LXXXVII.</p>

<p>AMONG the Performers to whom the Author of the following Dramatic Sketch esteems himself obliged for their endeavours to promote its success, MR. BANNISTER, Junior, MR. WEWITZER, MR. MOSS, and MRS. WEBB, are entitled to his particular thanks.</p>
<p>Mr. COLMAN'S conduct respecting this little Piece is its own panegyric. The first scenes were sent to that gentleman anonymously: he deemed them not destitute of merit, and therefore encouraged the Author to compleat the rest. Mr. COLMAN has since devoted the utmost care and attention to prepare the Piece for representation; and, in short, has interested himself warmly in its success, though the Author remains unknown to him.</p>

ENGLISH READINGS; A COMIC PIECE.</head>
<div1 type="scene">
<head>SCENE. <stage>A Room in BOOTEKIN'S House.</stage></head>
<stage>KITTY and Capt. WILMOT.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>PRAY let me alone, Captain Wilmot—you forget that you are making love to me instead of my mistress.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt. Wilmot.</speaker>
<p>"Why faith, Kitty, your beauty is so much a type of my dear Charlotte's, that, like a Roman Catholic, I almost adore the <hi>image</hi> for its likeness to the <hi>saint.</hi>"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>"Well," let us leave fooling—and consider how you are to secure Miss Charlotte—You find her father, old Bootekin, is resolved to marry her to his nephew Bob.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt. Wilmot.</speaker>
<p>I think I have a scheme to prevent that.—But tell me, Kitty, how did this <hi>rage</hi> for English Readings reach a town so far from London?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Poplin, the Irish mantua-maker, who came down from London, introduced it—
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>
You know from the moment that my master quitted business, as a shoemaker in town, and came down here to live on his <hi>means,</hi> Mrs. Poplin and he cou'd never set their horses together.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt. Wilmot.</speaker>
<p>"I think they quarrel'd who shou'd have the best <hi>pew</hi> at church."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>"And ever since have been at open war.—Mrs. Poplin <hi>took the field</hi> by giving a ball; and tho' old Bootekin hates the sound of a fiddle, he let all the heavy-heel'd rustics in the neighbourhood <hi>right hand and left</hi> in our hall, till they made the house shake to its foundation.—Next, the lady had card-parties;—determin'd not to be behind-hand, the old man quitted his pipe and bottle for <hi>Loo</hi> and <hi>Pope Joan.</hi>"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt. Wilmot.</speaker>
<p>And now the whim of burlesqueing a rational and elegant amusement—giving <hi>Readings,</hi> has seiz'd her ladyship—he is to have the same on a more extensive scale of absurdity—"as if resolv'd that all his follies, like the <hi>shadows</hi> of her's, shall not only keep pace with, but become <hi>larger</hi> than their <hi>originals.</hi>"</p>
<stage>Enter CHARLOTTE.</stage>
<p>Well, my dear Charlotte, what news?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charlotte.</speaker>
<p>My father has just told me that I am to marry my hopeful cousin, Bob Bootekin, next week.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt. Wilmot.</speaker>
<p>How unfortunate!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charlotte.</speaker>
<p>How <hi>fortunate</hi> you mean—if he had left my choice free, ten to one if I shou'd have come to a resolution for this twelvemonth; but an attempt to force my inclinations drives me to a determination at once.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt. Wilmot.</speaker>
<p>"Charming Charlotte!"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>"Take her at her word, Sir.—The captain
<pb n="7" facs="6"/>
has got a ring and licence in his pocket, ma'am."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Charlotte.</speaker>
<p>"Aye—but then I shall be so closely watch'd."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt. Wilmot.</speaker>
<p>I'll contrive to put them off their guard, and make this scheme of the <hi>Readings</hi> turn to our advantage—"if we can but persuade your father to alter the place of exhibition from his own house to the large room at the George Inn."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>Hush!—Lud, Miss Charlotte, here comes your father—and that booby, Dismal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt. Wilmot.</speaker>
<p>Then I must e'en quit the field—but while I can carry off so charming a prize, <hi>retreat</hi> is victory.</p>
<stage>[Exeunt.</stage>
</sp>
<stage>Enter BOOTEKIN and DISMAL.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Hold your tongue, sirrah!—and don't contradict me—you know I can't bear opposition.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dismal.</speaker>
<p>Well, master, I have done—I'll say no more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>But what signifies your <hi>saying</hi> no more—your cursed inflexible countenance has contradiction in every feature.—When I liv'd in London, I dreaded your appearance in the shop—the very sight of you put my customers in ill humour—and they then were sure to swear their shoes did not fit 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dismal.</speaker>
<p>Oh Lud! Oh Lud!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>"How often have I strapp'd you round the shop to cure your sour aspect?"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dismal.</speaker>
<p>"I remember it as well as if it was yesterday."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>"And yet, egad, let me strap you ever so often, I could never make you look
<pb n="8" facs="7"/>
pleasant—But" pray now let us know, good Mr. Dismal, what are your objections to my <hi>Readings?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dismal.</speaker>
<p>For my part I never knew, till now, that you was so given to reading.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>No more I an't—I never read but two books in my life—my <hi>cash-book,</hi> and my <hi>journal</hi>—but I'm resolved to like reading now, from mere opposition—What the devil, an't I a better gentleman, by a <hi>hundred</hi> a year, than any man in the neighbourhood?—and shall a paultry mantua-maker—a walking <hi>pincushion</hi>—a <hi>remnant</hi> of old tabby, pretend to give <hi>Readings,</hi> when I hardly know whether I can read or not?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dismal.</speaker>
<p>"She'll be too many for you yet—she vows she'll have the best <hi>pew</hi> at church to herself."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>"I tell you she shan't.—What a provoking dog it is!"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dismal.</speaker>
<p>The first time she can catch you absent from church, depend on't she'll fill the pew with her own family, and hang her footboy's hat upon your peg.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>I will not be absent, I tell you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dismal.</speaker>
<p>Suppose you should be taken ill.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>But I <hi>won't</hi> be taken ill.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dismal.</speaker>
<p>"But how can you help it?—She will certainly have the pew."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>"'Sblood! I'll go to church on Sunday-morning and afternoon, besides pray'r-days, I'll be <hi>damn'd</hi> if I dont."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dismal.</speaker>
<p>Well—well—I hope all will turn out for the best—but suppose—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! I'll suppose nothing—Out of the room directly. <stage>[Pushing him.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dismal.</speaker>
<p>Perhaps you'll think of my words.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="8"/>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p><stage>[pushes him out]</stage> Not if I can help it—they always give me the vapours.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter KITTY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>Sir, there is Mr. Stately, the great lawyer, come to pay you a visit—he is just getting off his horse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Odd's so, Mr. Stately!—shew him up directly—Bless me, I'm vastly glad he's come.— <stage>[Exit Kitty]</stage> A formal old prig—has a scull with nothing in it but <hi>pride</hi>—and yet thinks all the world fools but himself—However, I expect something at his death, and so I must not quarrel with him.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter STATELY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Bootekin, I rejoice to see you look so well—tho' indeed I don't wonder at it—when I consider that you take so much exercise—it will do you good—you have been <hi>used</hi> to it—being a working man, I <hi>mean to say.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>My dear friend, I heartily thank you for what you <hi>mean</hi> to say.—Well, and how d'ye do?—I suppose you are pretty well—I'm heartily glad of it—and so much for compliments.—Now, my dear Mr. Stately—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>"Perhaps I did not explain myself for <hi>you</hi> to understand me."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>"Yes, you did—and so let us proceed to business."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Bootekin, your ideas are confused—tho', indeed, how shou'd you have ideas—do you know what an idea is?—it is—I'll tell you another time what it is—I studied the noble science of the law—it was at the bar I learnt to think.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you had leisure enough for <hi>thinking</hi> then—I believe you never had the trouble to speak at the bar in your life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p><hi>Explanation</hi> was always my motto.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage> "And it suits you just as badly as many other mottos suit those who adopt them."—I suppose you have heard how Mrs. Poplin has crow'd over me, because, forsooth, I can't jabber gibberish out of a printed book as fast as she can—now is it not—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>Permit me to interrupt you—Reading you know—indeed I need not say <hi>you</hi> know—but <hi>I</hi> know—that reading—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Permit me to interrupt <hi>you</hi>—I only wish to ask you if my case is not a cursed hard one.—After working like a horse to get a fortune, I quitted business, and came down "here to smoke a comfortable pipe—walk about the green fields—look at the trees, and enjoy the pleasure of doing nothing—Well, down I came," and bought a large estate here, to make myself respected—and respected I was—"was complimented by being made churchwarden immediately on my arrival, and gave a feast to the parish"—the parson declared I spoke monstrous well at the vestry, and liked my company so well that he has <hi>dined</hi> with me three or four times a week—all my letters came directed to Robert Bootekin, Esquire—and the member for the county shook me by the hand last election, when he came round to <hi>canvas.</hi>—"Nay, Sir Charles Courtly came down from London t'other day to dine with me, and apologize for not paying two hundred pounds he owes me."—Now I call <hi>this</hi> being respected.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p><hi>You</hi> may call it so, Mr. Bootekin—you have not much idea of respect—He! He!
<pb n="11" facs="10"/>
He!—I don't mean to offend you—but give me leave to explain to you—it is my opinion—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! my dear friend, when you were in the law did you give opinions before the <hi>case</hi> was <hi>stated?</hi>—I was going to tell you, that since this Irish woman has set it about the town that I'm a vulgar dog, egad things begin to change—fellows in carters frocks and hobnail'd shoes contradict me at the vestry—the parson had the impudence to <hi>preach</hi> about the badness of my wine at my own table—and, egad, nobody in the place bow to me now but old women and children, and that's only when I give them halfpence—all because, forsooth, I'm a vulgar fellow.—Zounds! how can a man be vulgar with £.20,000 in his pocket?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>Look ye, Mr. Bootekin—I knew you in London—you made shoes for me many years—you are a well-meaning man, and I have a regard for you—but you have been brought up in a low way—and your ideas are confin'd—He! He! He! "Your arguments are loud and heavy, like a <hi>lap-stone</hi> dropt in a pond—they make a noise for a moment, and then sink in the mud—He! He! He!—sink in the mud"—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>"First raising circles in the pond, which, like your round-about explanations, become wider of the mark every moment, 'till at last they leave no trace of what occasioned them." He! He! He! <stage>[Imitating him.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Bootekin, you are ignoramus, as we say in the courts, and therefore—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>I beg pardon, Mr. Stately—I was too warm.— <stage>[Aside]</stage> Egad I shall lose the legacy.— <stage>[To him]</stage> I thank you much for the honour of
<pb n="12" facs="11"/>
this visit—this afternoon I give my Readings—I'll convince you and all the world that I am not a vulgar fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>I shall be very happy to see it, Mr. Bootekin, He! He! He!—Pray, do you read yourself?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>No,—my nephew, Bob, to whom I gave my business, will read—he is a smart lad, I assure you—and very much of a gentleman, though <hi>I</hi> say it.— <stage>[Enter Kitty.]</stage>—Is Bob come home?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>This very moment, Sir—he desires to speak to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>I'll introduce him to you, Mr. Stately, you'll be vastly pleas'd with him.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage> A mighty pretty girl, i'faith!—My dear, you seem in a hurry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>Had you any thing to say to me, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>Why, yes, my dear, I should like to have something to say to you.— <stage>[Aside]</stage> If I could but tell what—but these girls are so apt to laugh at a middle-aged man, when he makes love to them, that I am half afraid to venture.— <stage>[To her]</stage> I suppose you have a sweetheart, my pretty maid?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>Dear Sir, what should there be about me for people to fall in love with me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>Oh! ho!—it will do.— <stage>[To her]</stage> Fall in love with you!—why, who could help it?—Come here, child—don't be afraid of <hi>me.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear—no, Sir, I am not at all afraid of you—Ha! ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage> There—now it won't do—she begins to laugh—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kitty.</speaker>
<p>I am sure, Sir, you are too good-natur'd a gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my dear, you'll find me so.— <stage>[Aside]</stage> Egad, it <hi>will do</hi> after all. <stage>[To her]</stage> My sweet little Kitty, will you favour me so far as to—to— <stage>[Enter Bootekin and Bob Bootekin, who runs up to Stately, and shakes him by the hand]</stage>—to tell 'em to give my horse some corn?—do, my dear, go directly— <stage>[Exit Kitty.]</stage>— <stage>[Aside]</stage> To be interrupted in such an interesting situation!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I have the honour to be your most obedient, devoted, very humble servant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Stately, this is my nephew, Bob.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>Young man, I hear you are an orator, I suppose you have classical learning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Classical learning!—Ho! ho! ho! Bless your ignorance—why I went through all the <hi>classes</hi>—but my genius was too great to remember any thing I learnt at school.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>I must explain to you, that without classical learning genius is but a kind of—a—a—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Aye, aye—you mean to say 'tis all <hi>my eye.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p><hi>All</hi> my eye!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if you like it, I'll take t'other side of the question—'tis all the same to me—I'll engage to speak on any thing for a quarter of an hour at least—what say you to that, old gentleman?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Stately, pray excuse my nephew's freedom of speech, he! he!— <stage>[Aside to Bob]</stage> At him again, Bob.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>I perceive, Sir, you have resided in the country lately—you must come to town and visit our disputing society—we have questions to suit every body, and I speak upon all questions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>No doubt, and with equal ability—
<pb n="14" facs="13"/>
but, pray Sir, don't you find it necessary, sometimes, to understand your subject.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Not at all, Sir—I am a natural speaker—never study, but say whatever comes uppermost;—my opinion is, that a speech is a speech, if there are but words enough in it—and I am allowed to have the knack of saying more in a given time than any speaker in the society.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>I suppose you talk faster.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Exactly so, Sir.—But, à-propos, I can give you a specimen or two of our questions—Let me see, where are my memorandums—Oh, here! The questions to be debated, as they stand in order on our list, are; First—Is war or peace best for this country?—we were favour'd with this question by a <hi>navy agent,</hi> and we expect it will produce a warm debate.—Second in the list stands the question, Whether the lady who has <hi>black, blue,</hi> or <hi>grey eyes,</hi> is likely to make the best wife?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>A very instructive and amusing speculation—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>—Upon Charlotte's first introduction to Werter, did not she behave rather ungenteelly, in not offering him a dish of tea?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>Very material to be ascertained.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>The next—no, faith, the next question was debated last week, out of its turn, on account of its peculiar importance, and at the desire of several respectable members—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>What may that be?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Is the tinker, the taylor, or the lamplighter, the most useful member of society?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>"And how might it have been determined?"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>"Why, Sir—as our advertisement in the newspapers next day very properly stated—this
<pb n="15" facs="14"/>
question gave rise to a most important and interesting debate, in which instruction was mingled with amusement.—The arguments were, from time to time, enliven'd by the most brilliant flashes of wit and humour from several gentlemen of the first-rate abilities, who honour'd the question with their attention—(by the bye, <hi>I</hi> was prodigiously great that night)—with their attention.—But the variety of material points which presented for discussion protracting the debate to an unusual length, and the friends of the lamp-lighter (<hi>I</hi> supported him)—the friends of the lamp-lighter wishing for an opportunity of answering the arguments of their opponents, the debate was adjourned till next week."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>And, pray, young Mr. Bootekin, do you never touch on politics?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, Sir,—politics are my forte—we had a most glorious debate the other day—Whether some great men ought not to lose their heads for not doing something?—but, egad, I forget what—however I supported the question, and beat Dick Dab hollow, though he sported a dozen Latin mottos, which he stole from the Spectators and Tatlers the day before—I sat down amidst a thunder of applause from hands, feet, and sticks:—in short, the minister totter'd—when, within ten minutes of the debate closing, in came a posse of treasury-runners, as we suspect, who by dint of coughing, laughing, and hooting, put a stop to the debate—a battle ensued between two ladies—the <hi>moderator</hi> flew into a <hi>violent passion</hi>—constables were sent for—and the debate ended—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>As most political disputes end—neither party giving up the point.—Well, I must go
<pb n="16" facs="15"/>
and pay a few visits to some of my old acquaintance—and—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>You'll be back time enough for our Readings—what d' ye think of Bob—is not his conversation vastly amusing?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes—like the bells of a team of horses, it makes a pleasant jingling noise, though there is no meaning in it—He! he! he!—I don't mean to be severe, I assure you.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>I have got you plenty of company, however—and that's the principal part of the business.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>So it is—Well, and who are we to have, eh, Bob?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Faith, I don't know—they are of all sorts, like the county militia—however, you'll have enough of 'em—our great parlour will be so cramm'd that we sha'nt have room to stir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Odd's my life, that will be comfortable—"we'll shew old Mother Poplin what a rich man can do, tho' he is a vulgar fellow."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>"Nay, what's more, I have engag'd Sam Scrape, the fiddler, to touch up his catgut a little between the Readings—and his son will sing."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>"Thank ye, my dear Bob!—Odso, I am so overjoy'd"—But what will you read to them?—suppose you give them a touch from Burn's Justice, or the Parish Laws.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Oh Lord, no, uncle;—here, I have made out a bill of the evening's entertainment.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Let's see it—why, what the devil is all this?—Overture for <hi>two orchestras</hi>—Sam Scrape.—John Gilpin from <hi>Sterne,</hi> by Mr. Bootekin.—'He gave them hail-stones for rain'—Grand chorus—by a young gentleman, accompanied on the fiddle by Sam Scrape.—Zounds! Bob, what the devil is this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Fashion, Sir, fashion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Fashion!—But what's the reason?</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it, Sir—I have every respect for the gentleman's abilities; and, I am sure, Mr. Bootekin, your candour and goodsense will lead you to adopt a scheme which will shew Mr. Robert Bootekin's superior talents to advantage."</p>

<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>And so she has chosen you to negociate a peace, because your trade is war—a devilish

<sp>
<speaker>Wilmot.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>A dev'lish good thought, i'faith—I'll meet the lady, Captain—let her chuse her subject, from Johnny Gilpin up to Milton—prose, rhyme, or blank verse, all the same to me—I read 'em all alike.—Pray now, my dear uncle, consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Well, Bob, please yourself, and you'll please me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>I'll do more, I'll please the whole company.—Captain, we'll be with you—give me your hand!</p>

from those who do understand me, and those who don't understand me!—</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Spatula, I suppose you have heard the whole story."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spatula.</speaker>
<p>"Yes, I find that young couple have agreed to take a compound of Hymen's comforts—Ah, Madam, if you would but suffer your humble servant to make up a <hi>draught</hi> of <hi>ditto</hi> for you."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Poplin.</speaker>
<p>"Whenever I take that medicine, Mr. Spatula, you may depend upon not being my apothecary."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stately.</speaker>
<p>"Never mind 'em, Spatula—you can still be Romeo's apothecary.—You had better go on with the play, and sell the poor lad some rats-bane.—Ah, Bootekin, if you had not been a vulgar man, this wou'd not have happen'd to you."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p><stage>[To Wilmot]</stage> And you promise to make a gentlewoman of Charlotte, and that she shall take place of Mrs. Poplin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Wilmot.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I'll introduce your daughter to all the people of rank in the country—"she shall dance with a peer at the next race ball; and make such a figure that Mrs. Poplin shall break her heart with vexation in a fortnight."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Give me your hand.—Here, Charlotte—I forgive all that's past.—Bob, you're a blockhead—Mother Poplin, I begin to think you are a cursed <hi>low woman</hi>—Old Spatula, you shall dine with me now and then, I shall want somebody to laugh at.—As for you, Jack Stately, I'm resolv'd to unburthen my conscience—you are a d—d fool—I've long'd to tell you so for ten years past, and now I have done it—so you may leave my legacy to the parish.</p>

<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>And what's to become of me, uncle?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bootekin.</speaker>
<p>Go to town, and make speeches.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bob.</speaker>
<p>Faith I'll take your advice, and strive to lose my disappointment in the sweet intoxicating draught of public approbation.—Those who, like me, have been honour'd with its genial influence, can alone judge of the feelings excited by the <hi>applause</hi> of an <hi>audience.</hi></p>
