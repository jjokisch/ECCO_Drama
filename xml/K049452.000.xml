<stage>A Room in Mr. <hi>DU-CHESNE'S</hi> House.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ROSALIE, LAURETTA <hi>following.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>YES, terrible as the idea is, I believe I shall prefer a convent to your brother, my dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>I believe you will not, my dear.—My brother has chiefly resided in his native province, has been several times in Spain, and is lately come to Paris, the intrigues of which have been most tremendously described to him—His head is whimsical, but his heart is good.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="6"/>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>You have almost as much reason to fear his jealous caprices as I have.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>More—The excellence of your principles, and propriety of your conduct when married will soon cure him of suspicion; but I am in instantaneous danger; he insists on my immediate marriage with that ridiculous Spanish doctor, Don Decrepito.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>And you are in love with this Englishman, the generous Sidney.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>Hush! Not so much as a whisper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>Why so? The Englishman is even a better match.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> DU-CHESNE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Who? What Englishman?—Who is a better match?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>The—The—Pshaw—What is the title of that—my Lor Anglois, my dear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>Lackland.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>True—my Lord Lackland would be a better match for Mademoiselle—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="7"/>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>My Lord, and Mademoiselle—Subterfuge! Pretext.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>My good brother—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Intrigues!—You are breathing the licentious air of Paris—the seat of falsehood, art and libertinism.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA</speaker>
<stage><hi>(to</hi> DU-CHESNE).</stage>
<p>Do you know, sir; I think you have taken very strange fancies?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Blame the place, blame the people, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>Why then did you come here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>To meet my friend, marry my sister, and get married myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>With my consent, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>That you had kindly granted, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>You rely, perhaps, on the commands of my family; but those would be ineffectual, I assure you, Sir, if I did not persuade myself your present humour would be of short duration.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="8"/>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>I was generous enough, Madam, to rely on yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>And why not rely on me too, brother?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>I have my reasons.—Every man in Paris is by profession a lover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>Yes, it is really a charming place.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>It shall be my care, however, that none of them shall enter this house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>It will be your care, I'm afraid, to make yourself their jest. Virtue, Sir, is a better security than prisons.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE</speaker>
<stage>(Aside).</stage>
<p>I will have both securities.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>In the space of four and twenty hours many strange things happen in this great town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>To the credulous and unwary I grant, but not to the prudent and the wise.—I will therefore instantly take every precaution. Antoine! Picard! <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="9"/>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>This good jealous brother of yours is really to be pitied.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>Trick'd, thou meanest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>I wish it with all my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>We will cure him, I hope, girl.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> PICARD.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>Now, Picard; whither in such haste?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PICARD.</speaker>
<p>Must not tell, Madam.— <stage>(Going, turns back at seeing <hi>Rosalie</hi> take out her purse.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you may.— <stage>(Gives him a crown piece.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PICARD.</speaker>
<p>Lord, Madam, you have such winning ways—I am going for the <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Mason</hi>—hush!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>So, so!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>Let me know when they come.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PICARD.</speaker>
<p>Must not, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="10"/>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>Pho! I tell you once more you may. <stage>(Gives him another crown piece.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PICARD.</speaker>
<p>Lord, Madam, you have such convincing reasons. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>Why do you wish to know?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>Because I should not wonder if my enamoured Englishman, and his crafty valet, La-fourbe, were themselves to personate this Smith and Mason; I will watch for them through the window.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>Ay, indeed! How can they gain intelligence?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>You see the mercenary temper of Parisian servants, and know their unconquerable propensity to tattle and intrigue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and your brother knows it too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>Sidney has planted his emissaries, by whose aid he gains intelligence, not only from my maid Marinette, whenever she can find opportunity, but from this Picard, and his fellowservant, Antoine, of every thing that passes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="11"/>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>That I may aid you more effectually, you must instruct me how I may become acquainted with your lover.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>I will find some means of sending him to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>I think you had better not; I shall perhaps prefer him to this jealous brother of yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>I do not fear you, girl—I flatter myself, he sincerely loves me. Besides, he is an Englishman, and piques himself on his fidelity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>
<p>Then he has not been long at Paris. However rich in money, and sincerity, your prodigal Englishmen may come to this city, they generally return bankrupts in both. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> DU-CHESNE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Where does this fellow stay?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<stage>Enter PICARD.</stage>
<stage>(Speaks aside to his master, but loud enough for <hi>Rosalie</hi> to hear.)</stage>
<p>The Smith and Mason are waiting at the street-door. May they come in, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="12"/>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Hush! No, blockhead! Hav'n't I told you no man must enter the house under any pretence whatever?—Fetch my keys!—Stay—I will go myself. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PICARD.</speaker>
<p>Fine doings, Madam!—My master has placed Antoine at the door, with a double-loaded, double-barrell'd musquet on his shoulder, to shoot any man that wants to come in—but hush! <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> DU-CHESNE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>I very well perceive, Rosalie, you think my conduct strange.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>Lord, brother, how is that possible? I am delighted with your bolts, bars, bullets, centinels, spring-guns, and man-traps.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>I wish you were delighted with your future husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>What, my dear Doctor Decrepito!—Oh! the charming Adonis—His nine hairs on each side his bald pate, so bepowdered; his sallow face, grisly beard, and bristly eyebrows, are all so bewitching! So gallant too in his dress! Disdaining flannels, and shivering in summer silks.—Such easy elegance of carriage, his gait so upright,
<pb n="13" facs="13"/>
his manners so polished, and his language so eloquent. Oh! the delightful creature!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Suffer me to tell you, sister—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>Oh yes—a prodigy of wisdom, as is evident in his determination to take unto himself a wife, and in selecting me, happy woman, to be the partner of his joys.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Look ye, Rosalie; I shall not waste time in reasoning; I have given my promise, and am determined. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>No, brother, I am determined, and will lose no time either. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>ROSALIE.</speaker>
<p>I must be gone; my brother is coming; but take that direction to my friend Lauretta, and consult what is best to be done. <stage>(Putting down the sash.)</stage></p>

<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>One moment, my angel!</p>

<stage>Enter <hi>DU-CHESNE</hi> (from the House).</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Who are you, friend?—What do you want there?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>Want, sir?—I, sir—I—I—I am the smith, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>And I the mason, at your service, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Oh!—But why were your eyes fixed on that window?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>Why, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Ay—Why?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>Lord, sir, my master—that is, my neighbour, here, knows there are a great many cheats, impostors, and house-breakers, in this town—some steal your goods, some your money, some your wives, some your daughters.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Very true, friend; 'tis a damn'd wicked town, and my stay in it shall be short.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="15"/>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>What then, sir, you are a stranger? Ah! 'tis a wicked town indeed; if you did but know all its tricks.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir, I was meditating within myself whether it might not be possible for one of these tricking fellows to get in at that window.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>To prevent which, friend, I have sent for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>You did right, sir—My master's your man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Your master!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir, yes; I call him my master, 'tis a way I've got—he's such a master of his business.—He's as honest a fellow as any in Paris. <stage>(Clapping Sidney on the shoulder.)</stage></p>

<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>What, sir, you have some bird, I suppose, which you are afraid should fly away? <stage>(Significantly.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Why look you, my honest friends, I'll be sincere with you: <stage>(to La-fourbe)</stage> I have an unmarried sister.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>Have you, sir? I warrant then that is her window? <stage>(Looking up.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>It is, and I have sent for you to fasten it up; and for you <stage>(to La-fourbe)</stage> to wall up the garden gate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I'm your very humble servant; but I have not the least inclination to be hang'd in your service.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Hang'd!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="17" facs="17"/>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>'Tis a sign you are a stranger, sir—Why, sir, it was but last week there was a placard posted on every wall, by which it is death to nail up windows, or wall up doors, for the purpose of imprisoning wives, sisters, or daughters.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Surely, friend!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>'Tis very true, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>I never saw any such placard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>That may be, sir.—But hark ye—this way—by the same edict, if we do not inform against you, for making this proposal, we may both be sent to the <hi>Gallies.</hi></p>

<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! I never heard of so strange an edict!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>Ah, sir! strange indeed! But you are a stranger in Paris.—You see that fellow?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Well, what of him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>I know him; I speak him fair, because he's a sorry knave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Aye, indeed! You speak him fair, because he's a sorry knave?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="18" facs="18"/>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>Oh! yes! I don't mind affronting an honest fellow, but I always speak fair to a knave—Take my advice; give him a louis, or two, hush money.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Why—but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>Justice is very secret—and very sudden here—Tried and executed before you can well say your prayers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE</speaker>
<stage>(aside).</stage>
<p>The fellow may be a sorry lying knave himself; however, it is better to make sure—Well, well, friend, I don't mind a louis. <stage>(Offers money to Sidney)</stage> Here.</p>

<p>Sir!</p>

<p>None in the world, sir.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>None in the world, sir, from my neighbour, here—but—</p>

<p>But what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE</speaker>
<stage><hi>(following</hi> Du-chesne).</stage>
<p>Why, sir, as two of us were privy to the fact—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Well—What then, friend?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>Tho' I have a very good opinion of myself—I dare not be answerable for too much. Man is frail; I might forget how generous you had been to my neighbour, here—not having any thing to remember you by myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>I think, friend, you told me there were plenty of cheats, and rogues, in this town.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>How dare you, sirrah—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>Don't be in a passion, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>Are not you afraid of broken bones?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>Not in the least, sir—You Englishmen threaten, but take care not to beat your servants.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>And how so, sirrah?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>Because, in your sulky land of liberty, if you beat them, they are apt to run restive, face about, and beat you; though egad they are beginning to do that here, in Paris.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>

<speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, sir, to business. Have you procured the pedlar's parcel for me, and the Scotch disguise?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>LA-FOURBE.</speaker>
<p>La Ruse is waiting with it, at yonder cabaret, sir.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTOINE.</speaker>
<p>I cannot tell, sir. You know I am not to stir from my post—but I heard them talk of blood, and gunpowder, death and destruction; and 'tis my belief they are going to come to blow up the house, and murder I.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Cowardly booby!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>ANTOINE.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I am certain I heard them talk of either a hundred, or a hundred thousand, Savoyards?</p>

<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Keep your post, poltroon, and let no man enter at your peril.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>ANTOINE.</speaker>
<p>Lord, sir, though I have a double barrel gun; what can poor I do against a hundred thousand Savoyards?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Mind my orders, or beware—I believe they were two lying, designing villains; but this city swarms with such—I must look to my sister. If any of them get her from this house, till she

and I being less inquisitive did not question her <hi>circumstantially</hi>—But even if I had invented the story, can you suppose me simple enough to betray myself in so palpable a manner?—If you either love your sister, your honour, or your peace of mind, be more generous, and less jealous.</p>

What am I doing?—How do I know that this is the brother of my noble friend?—It may be a trick.—I'll order him out of the house—Yet, what rashness!—Should it really be his brother!—With how many cares am I distracted!—I begin to fear I have vainly undertaken an impossible task, that of encountering the wit of woman, and all the arts of this infernal town!—Shew me to the gentleman.— <stage><hi>(Exeunt</hi> Du-chesne <hi>and</hi> Picard.)</stage></p>

<p>I went into a shop as I pass'd through the Rue St. Honoré, and I recollect I laid it on the counter, and this brat of Bellona, though he knows what a waike mimory I have—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>DU-CHESNE.</speaker>
<p>Be not too rash, sir. What have you lost?</p>

<p>I have just receiv'd a letter from Sir Patrick O'Dogherty, informing me that he is coming to Paris, and that he has written by the same post to your brother; your brother's letter is this moment come, and Picard has taken it to him.</p>

<p>Quick, then; this letter, I see, is a double one; take away the cover, and it may have been written to any body else—convey it to Sidney—if we can accomplish that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LAURETTA.</speaker>

<p>Well, I take it for granted you are so—and, to say the truth, I begin to admire you, myself; for you have imposed upon me, tho' I doubled all the precaution which habit had already made natural to me.—I will enquire further when my mind is cool, but with a full determination, after embroiling myself to no purpose with masons, men-milliners, Scotch pedlars, and Irish captains—never more to be SUSPICIOUS.</p>
