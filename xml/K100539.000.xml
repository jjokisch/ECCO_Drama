<p>WHEN I inscribe this Tragedy to you, I mean to pay myself a very high compliment; the utmost I could possibly say of you, would by no means extend your Reputation; but it will do me much honour to declare, that so celebrated a writer has distinguished CLEMENTINA with the most essential attention; and that so valuable a man has given me leave to sign myself, what I truly am,</p>

<p>THE Author of this Tragedy has printed several lines for the Closet, which, in the Representation, were omitted for the sake of brevity.—The chief business of this advertisement, however, is to acknowledge his obligations to the inimitable performance of Mrs. YATES, and to thank Mr. BENSLEY, Mr. SAVIGNY, and Mr. WROUGHTON, for their great good-nature, in undertaking their respective characters at the short notice of a week, when Mr. Ross unexpectedly returned the part of <hi>Anselmo</hi><note n="*" place="foot">This circumstance obliged Mr. BENSLEY, who was cast for <hi>Palermo,</hi> to undertake Mr. SAVIGNY'S part, which was originally <hi>Granville</hi>—Mr. SAVIGNY taking <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and Mr. WROUGHTON, <hi>Palermo.</hi></note>, which had been in his possession above a fortnight, and left it no more than barely possible for the utmost diligence of these Gentlemen, to exhibit a piece, which the public have since been kindly pleased to honour with the most generous approbation.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE,</head>
<byline>By GEORGE COLMAN, <abbr>Esq</abbr></byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. BENSLEY.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>IN these, our moral and religious days,</l>
<l>Men dread the crying sin of writing Plays;</l>
<l>While some, whose wicked wit incurs the blame,</l>
<l>Howe'er they love the trespass, fly the shame.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>If, a new holy war with Vice to wage,</l>
<l>Some preacher quits the pulpit for the stage,</l>
<l>The Rev'rend Bard, with much remorse and fear,</l>
<l>Attempts to give his Evening-Lecture here.</l>
<l>The work engender'd, to the world must rise;</l>
<l>But yet the father may elude our eyes.</l>
<l>The parish on this trick of youth might frown,</l>
<l>And thus, unown'd, 'tis thrown upon the Town.</l>
<l>At our Director's door he lays the sin,</l>
<l>Who sees the Babe, relents, and takes it in;</l>
<l>To swathe and dress it first unstrings his purse,</l>
<l>Then kindly puts it out to You—to nurse.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Should some young Counsel, thro' his luckless star,</l>
<l>By writing Plays turn truant to the Bar.</l>
<l>Call'd up by you to this High Court of Wit,</l>
<l>With non <hi>inventus</hi> we return the writ.</l>
<l>No <hi>latitat</hi> can force him to appear,</l>
<l>Whose failure and success cause equal fear,</l>
<l>Whatever fees his clients here bestow,</l>
<l>He loses double in the Courts below.</l>
</lg>
<notatedMusic/>
<lg>
<l>Grave solemn Doctors, whose prescribing pen</l>
<l>Has in the trade of Death kill'd many men,</l>
<l><pb n="x" facs="6"/>With vent'rous quill here tremblingly engage</l>
<l>To slay Kings, Queens, and Heroes, on the stage.</l>
<l>The Great, if great men write, of shame afraid</l>
<l>Come forth <hi>incog.</hi>—and Beaux, in masquerade.</l>
<l>Some Demireps in wit, of doubtful fame,</l>
<l>Tho' known to all the town, withhold their name.</l>
<l>Thus each by turns ungratefully refuse</l>
<l>To own the favours of their Lady-Muse;</l>
<l>Woo'd by the Court, the College, Bar and Church,</l>
<l>Court, Bar, Church, College, leave her in the lurch.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>'Tis your's to-night the work alone to scan;</l>
<l>Arraign the bard, regardless of the man!</l>
<l>If Dulness waves her poppies o'er his play,</l>
<l>To Critic fury let it fall a prey;</l>
<l>But if his art the tears of Pity draws,</l>
<l>Ask not his name—but crown him with applause!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>CLEMENTINA.</speaker>
<l>DISTRACTION! here so soon?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>This very hour—</l>
<l>Your good, your noble, yet misguided father,</l>
<l>This moment chill'd me with the hated tale;</l>
<l>Then seizing eagerly my trembling hand,</l>
<l>"Tell Clementina, tell your stubborn friend,"</l>
<l>Cry'd he, in accents positive and stern,</l>
<l>"That brave Palermo, just return'd from chains,</l>
<l>"Chains greatly purchas'd in his country's cause,</l>
<l>"Must now receive such welcome, such affection,</l>
<l>"As suits her virtue, and Anselmo's daughter.—</l>
<l>"Tell her, my word's irrevocably giv'n,</l>
<l>"And bid her guard the honour of her father."</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEMENTINA.</speaker>
<l><pb n="2" facs="9"/>Why let the storm exert its utmost rage,</l>
<l>And burst in thunder on my wretched head!</l>
<l>Let this severe, this unrelenting father,</l>
<l>Cast me a houseless wand'rer on the world,</l>
<l>Yet shall my soul with unabating firmness</l>
<l>Deny her sanction to Palermo's claim.</l>
<l>O Elizara, you who know the cause,</l>
<l>The endless cause of Clementina's tears,</l>
<l>Who saw the awful, tho' the secret rite</l>
<l>That gave this hand, now widow'd, to Rinaldo;</l>
<l>Is there, in all the various rounds of woe,</l>
<l>A curse so great, a pang so exquisite,</l>
<l>As this poor breast is singled out to feel?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>Indulge not thus a painful recollection!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEMENTINA.</speaker>
<l>Oh memory! ev'n madness cannot lose it!</l>
<l>Mangled with wounds, amidst unnumber'd foes;</l>
<l>My hapless husband for his country fell!</l>
<l>Yet, the sad story of our loves conceal'd,</l>
<l>I was allow'd no privilege of tears,</l>
<l>But doom'd to hide the anguish of my heart.—</l>
<l>And now, in all the fulness of despair,</l>
<l>To have another forc'd upon me! horror!</l>
<l>It is not to be borne!—But I'm resolv'd,</l>
<l>And will devote the remnant of my life</l>
<l>To lost Rinaldo's memory, or die</l>
<l>Some little hour before my griefs would end me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>Alas, I feel the sorrows of your bosom,</l>
<l>With all the ardent sympathy of friendship;</l>
<l>And know how souls so delicate as yours,</l>
<l>Must spurn th' idea of a second lord.</l>
<l>Yet blame no more the sternness of Anselmo;</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="10"/>The antient hate too long, too idly cherish'd,</l>
<l>Between your angry father and Rinaldo's,</l>
<l>First urg'd the measure of a private union.</l>
<l>A stranger therefore to your grief, Anselmo</l>
<l>Claims but the right which custom, and which nature,</l>
<l>Have long giv'n parents o'er their children's hearts.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEMENTINA.</speaker>
<l>What claim, what right, misjudging Elizara,</l>
<l>Can tyrant custom plead, or nature urge</l>
<l>To force the free election of the soul?</l>
<l>Say, should affection light the nuptial torch,</l>
<l>Or should the rash decision of a father</l>
<l>Doom his sad race to wretchedness for ever?</l>
<l>No, Elizara; custom has no force,</l>
<l>Nature no right, to sanctify oppression;</l>
<l>And parents vainly tell us of indulgence,</l>
<l>When they give all but happiness to children.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>True—yet a cruel crisis in your fate,</l>
<l>Has much to offer for the good Anselmo.</l>
<l>He fondly thinks his daughter disengag'd;</l>
<l>Believes too, fondly, that Palermo's merit</l>
<l>Must touch the gentle bosom of my friend:</l>
<l>If then determin'd to reject his choice,</l>
<l>At once throw off constraint—at once be open,</l>
<l>And seal his lips for ever on the subject,</l>
<l>By a frank mention of your fatal story.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEMENTINA.</speaker>
<l>What! and expose my dear Rinaldo's kindred</l>
<l>To all the fury of enrag'd Anselmo,</l>
<l>The now acknowledg'd ruler of the state;</l>
<l>Who, tho' renown'd for wisdom and for justice.</l>
<l>Yet in the points, the cruel points of honour,</l>
<l>Is rigid, stern, and fatally severe?</l>
<l>No, Elizara; tho' these fading eyes</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="11"/>No more must hope to gaze upon Rinaldo,</l>
<l>Tho' the soul-swelling language of my woes,</l>
<l>Falls unregarded on the silent tomb,</l>
<l>And boasts no pow'r to call my slaughter'd hero</l>
<l>From the dark, dreary mansions of the dead;</l>
<l>Still let me guard whatever he held dear,</l>
<l>Nor pluck down added ruin on his house!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>Anselmo's justice will o'ercome his hatred—</l>
<l>Were he inclin'd to make his will his law,</l>
<l>Or wish'd for means to gratify resentment,</l>
<l>He has the pow'r already; but his mind,</l>
<l>Superior ever to the thought of wrong,</l>
<l>Can feel no passion to disgrace his virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEMENTINA.</speaker>
<l>The best may err, nor will I tempt his rage;</l>
<l>The mighty measure of my woe is full—</l>
<l>Why then, when fate's unmerciful decree</l>
<l>Has curs'd me up to such a height of ill,</l>
<l>Why should I shudder at the gathering storm,</l>
<l>Or seek for shelter in another's sorrow?</l>
<l>I now have no asylum but the grave:</l>
<l>Tho' did peace court me from the bow'rs of bliss,</l>
<l>My soul would scorn to hear the charmer's voice,</l>
<l>If she requir'd me to perform a deed,</l>
<l>That either shock'd my justice, or my honour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>Then summon all your firmness, Clementina!</l>
<l>For here Anselmo comes, and brings Palermo;</l>
<l>O that your terrors for Rinaldo's kindred,</l>
<l>May stiil subside, and hear the voice of reason!</l>
<l>Your soul is ill adapted to disguise;</l>
<l>And without cause to disappoint his views,</l>
<l>Must be as fatal as to tell him all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEMENTINA.</speaker>
<l><pb n="5" facs="12"/>They're here—let us retire—Palermo's presence</l>
<l>Is now a thousand deaths—and tho' prepar'd</l>
<l>With fortitude to act—still, Elizara,</l>
<l>While I can shun the conflict, let me spare,</l>
<l>Spare ev'n the feelings of a cruel father! <stage>[Exeunt.</stage> </l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>ANSELMO</hi> and <hi>PALERMO.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Gone so abruptly!—gone at our approach!—</l>
<l>And yet, my son, the crimson hue of virtue</l>
<l>Will always deepen at a lover's sight,</l>
<l>Who comes to ask his certain day of transport,</l>
<l>And knows the hour of apprehension o'er.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>'Tis just, my lord—But still however lovely,</l>
<l>The soft emotion of these gentle terrors,</l>
<l>Spreads in the blooming daughters of perfection,</l>
<l>Still Clementina might have kindly giv'n</l>
<l>A long lost lover welcome from his bonds;</l>
<l>And nobly told him that his ruin'd fortunes</l>
<l>Were ev'n deem'd merit with Anselmo's daughter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Think not, Palermo, of your ruin'd fortunes;</l>
<l>My Clementina, with her father's eyes,</l>
<l>Regardless looks on dignity and wealth;</l>
<l>And holds the mind pre-eminent in both,</l>
<l>That boasts a bright pre-eminence in virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>When sharp adversity has stung the mind,</l>
<l>It makes us doubly conscious of neglect:</l>
<l>And sure a soul less sensible than mine</l>
<l>Had room to start at Clementina's coldness.</l>
<l>Judge then by all that headlong fire of youth</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="13"/>Which once swell'd up your own impassion'd breast,</l>
<l>If I could let indifference pass unnotic'd?</l>
<l>He never lov'd that bore a slight with temper,</l>
<l>Nor ever merited a worthy heart,</l>
<l>Who meanly stoop'd, contented with a cold one.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>No more, my son!—This day rewards your suff'rings,</l>
<l>For Clementina shall to-day be yours;</l>
<l>And while love courts you with his ripest roses,</l>
<l>The golden sun of honourable greatness</l>
<l>Shines out to crown you with his warmest beams—</l>
<l>Our native land—but what exceeds all price,</l>
<l>Our native liberty shall soon be ours;</l>
<l>And soon Palermo nobly shall revenge</l>
<l>On haughty Ferdinand, that scourge of earth,</l>
<l>The wrongs ill-fated Venice has sustain'd,</l>
<l>The wrongs which heedless of a soldier's glory</l>
<l>Th' imperial plund'rer on my son himself</l>
<l>So poorly, meanly, infamously heap'd,</l>
<l>When in a base exaction for his ransom,</l>
<l>He seiz'd his all, nor left th' indignant warrior</l>
<l>A home to rest in from the weight of chains—</l>
<l>Our French ally, the nobly-minded Lewis,</l>
<l>This hour dispatches an embassador,</l>
<l>To give our country renovated being,</l>
<l>And burst asunder ev'ry yoke of Spain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>The glorious news o'erpays an age of bonds!</l>
<l>O for a curse, a quick dispatching curse,</l>
<l>To blast the ruthless tyrant on his throne,</l>
<l>And mark him out thro' all succeeding ages,</l>
<l>A dread example to despotic kings!</l>
<l>But say, and bless me with some certain hope;</l>
<l>On what foundation does the royal Lewis,</l>
<l>Bid us thus boldly, considently look</l>
<l>For instant vengeance, and for instant freedom?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l><pb n="7" facs="14"/>That I am yet to learn.—But noble still</l>
<l>I ever found him in our various treaties;</l>
<l>And therefore cannot, will not, doubt him now.</l>
<l>Sunk by his late distresses, Ferdinand</l>
<l>Now mourns his dreams of universal empire,</l>
<l>And shrinks in secret at the arms of France.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>Eternal praises to the God of battles!</l>
<l>Yes, scepter'd savage, we may reach you yer,</l>
<l>And boldly tell you in the face of nations,</l>
<l>That royal robbers from unerring justice</l>
<l>Demand a double measure of perdition!—</l>
<l>The needy ruffian, in his hour of hunger,</l>
<l>Has some excuse for prowling on his neighbour;</l>
<l>But when the arm, the mighty arm of kings,</l>
<l>That shou'd protect all mankind from oppression;</l>
<l>Is stretch'd to seize on what it ought to guard,</l>
<l>Then heaven's own brand, in aggravated fire,</l>
<l>Shou'd strike th' illustrious villain to his hell;</l>
<l>And war in mercy for a groaning world.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Oh, nobly said!—Our cause is just, and heaven</l>
<l>Fights on our side: for late, the Spanish troops</l>
<l>In two great fields were wholly overthrown,</l>
<l>And fill'd the plains with myriads of their dead.</l>
<l>Our navies too, tho' some Venetian cities</l>
<l>Lye humbled still beneath the tyrant's yoke,</l>
<l>Fill Spain with constant and with just alarms;</l>
<l>For such a blaze of unexampled glory</l>
<l>Has crown'd the fleets entrusted to my care,</l>
<l>That tho' depriv'd of more than half our realm,</l>
<l>We still remain a formidable foe,</l>
<l>And rule triumphant o'er the boundless wave.</l>

<l><pb n="8" facs="15"/>How the bright prospect bursts upon my view,</l>
<l>And lifts me up in fancy to the stars!</l>
<l>O did the fair, the matchless Clementina,</l>

<l>This one blest hour had madden'd me with rapture.</l>

<l>Again, Palermo?—But I cease to chide,</l>

<l>If I know aught of Clementina's heart,</l>
<l>'Twill beat in honest unison to mine,</l>

<l>Nay, no thanks!</l>
<l>The man who bears not to a friend distress'd</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>AND is it possible? Do I once more</l>
<l>Behold Rinaldo?—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>Yes, my Elizara;</l>
<l>Yet oh take heed, sweet maid, alone to know me</l>
<l>For what I seem—Th' ambassador of France.</l>
<l>As such alone Anselmo has receiv'd me,</l>
<l>And such my king confirms me.—But declare,</l>
<l>How fares my Clementina?—How does she</l>
<l>Support the oft proclaim'd, the general tale,</l>
<l>That now six moons has rank'd me with the dead?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>She bears it like a wife that truly lov'd—</l>
<l>But by what miracle again restor'd</l>
<l>Acquaint me!—for concurring multitudes</l>
<l>Beheld your fall in battle, and reported,</l>
<l>That in a pile of greatly-slaughter'd heroes,</l>
<l>A Gallic squadron bore you from the field.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>I fell indeed amidst the gen'ral carnage,</l>
<l>And lay some hours among the honour'd dead;</l>
<l>For whom the vanquish'd, France's gen'rous sons</l>
<l>Made one bold effort to obtain a grave:</l>
<l>Here a brave youth of that exalted nation,</l>
<l><pb n="14" facs="21"/>Close by whose side with emulative fire</l>
<l>I sought for Venice on that hapless day;</l>
<l>Beheld the man he deign'd to call his friend,</l>
<l>And by a kind of miracle restor'd me.—</l>
<l>Then to the king in terms of warmest weight,</l>
<l>Proclaim'd my fancied merits.—Royal Lewis</l>
<l>Received the story with a gracious ear,</l>
<l>And pour'd profuse, his favours on Rinaldo.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>Why then, O why, distinguish'd thus, thus honour'd,</l>
<l>Did not Rinaldo sooth his sorrowing friends,</l>
<l>And ease the torments of a wife's despair?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>O Elizara! how my soul has felt</l>
<l>For all the anguish she was doom'd to suffer,</l>
<l>That heaven, which knows the greatness of my love,</l>
<l>Alone can witness.—But the conquering arms</l>
<l>Of widely wasting Ferdinand, cut off</l>
<l>Our commerce with the world—and had not fate,</l>
<l>In two late fields propitious smil'd upon us,</l>
<l>Rinaldo yet, distracted and forlorn,</l>
<l>Had drag'd a chain of miserab'le being;</l>
<l>Nor known, as now he shall, th' extatic bliss</l>
<l>Of speaking peace to weeping Clementina.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>But whence this transformation?—Why conceal'd</l>
<l>Beneath the garb of France, does brave Rinaldo</l>
<l>So closely seek to hide himself in Granville?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>For ends of moment.—If the charge I bear</l>
<l>Meets, as I hope, and as I think it ought,</l>
<l>A warm reception from Anselmo—Then</l>
<l>I come determin'd to avow my marriage;</l>
<l>And gracious Lewis will, I trust, remove</l>
<l>The fatal feuds that shake our angry houses.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l><pb n="15" facs="22"/>But shou'd Anselmo disapprove your charge,</l>
<l>What measure then remains to be pursu'd,</l>
<l>And what becomes of weeping Clementina?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>There my disguise is suited to assist me;</l>
<l>Shou'd he refuse to join the views of France,</l>
<l>My orders are that instant to return,</l>
<l>And my design, to bear off Clementina.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>You talk, Rinaldo, with an air of triumph;</l>
<l>Think you the first of our Venetian daughters,</l>
<l>Can in a moment thus be borne away;</l>
<l>Borne from her palace compass'd round with guards,</l>
<l>Surrounding virgins, and a watchful father?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>My name conceal'd and all my train instructed,</l>
<l>My king's credentials bearing but the title,</l>
<l>Which he himself has giv'n me, and which yet</l>
<l>Has reach'd no ear of Venice but your own,</l>
<l>Can there exist a doubt of my success?</l>
<l>Unknown—unnotic'd—unsuspected quite,</l>
<l>A trusty friend shall lead her to the beach,</l>
<l>If Clementina, like myself, disguis'd</l>
<l>Will venture aught to bless her faithful husband.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>Rinaldo shou'd pursue a diff'rent course,</l>
<l>A course more suited to his worth and honour.</l>
<l>Now independent, now so rais'd in France,</l>
<l>What can you dread from Venice or its leader?</l>
<l>Your fortunes now are equal to your birth.</l>
<l>Shou'd then your embassy displease Anselmo,</l>
<l>Act like yourself!—throw off this dark disguise,</l>
<l>And nobly claim your wife.—You know his justice,</l>
<l>And know besides he cannot hate you farther.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l><pb n="16" facs="23"/>Fain, gentle maid, wou'd I pursue this counsel,</l>
<l>And in the face of day assert my right;</l>
<l>But if the purport or my public business,</l>
<l>Which heaven avert! shou'd raise Anselmo's anger,</l>
<l>My life, once known, must expiate my crime.</l>
<l>I come, I hope, to blese the state of Venice,</l>
<l>But I come also, with a foreign ruler—</l>
<l>This, you know well, is death by law declar'd,</l>
<l>Nor cou'd th' ambassador of France, preserve</l>
<l>Th' offending subject from the stroke of justice.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ELIZARA.</speaker>
<l>May heaven indulgent smile upon your hopes!</l>
<l>But oh! I dread, I dread a disappointment.</l>
<l>And see, impatience frowning on his brow,</l>
<l>Hither Anselmo comes.—Let me fly hence,</l>
<l>And bless my friend, with tidings of her lord! <stage>[Exit.</stage> </l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>ANSELMO,</hi> with Papers.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Well, Sir, the views of Lewis are at length</l>
<l>Reveal'd; and here, I see, he speaks them plainly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>Why, sage Anselmo, this offended brow?</l>
<l>I trust my master's offers have deserv'd</l>
<l>Your highest approbation; for they breathe</l>
<l>Nought but attachment, and regard for Venice.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Is this the basis of his love for Venice?</l>
<l>Has he stood forth a champion for our freedom,</l>
<l>Merely himself to tread us into slaves?</l>
<l>And sav'd us from the arm of haughty Spain,</l>
<l>To make us bear his own oppressive yoke?</l>
<l>Go tell your king, and tell him from Anselmo,</l>
<l><pb n="17" facs="24"/>That France and Venice can be friends no more;</l>
<l>Tell him, to us, all tyrants are the same;</l>
<l>Or if in bonds the never-conquer'd soul</l>
<l>Can feel a pang more keen than slav'ry's self,</l>
<l>'Tis when the chains, that crush us into dust,</l>
<l>Are forg'd by hands from which we hop'd for freedom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>And what idea does my business raise,</l>
<l>Of slaves or tyrants, servitude or chains?</l>
<l>'Tis true, the gracious Lewis has propos'd</l>
<l>To take the state of Venice to his care,</l>
<l>If sage Anselmo, her illustrious leader,</l>
<l>Approves the scheme of well-concerted empire—</l>
<l>He sees with deep, with nobly-minded sorrow,</l>
<l>How, still expos'd to ev'ry pow'rful neighbour,</l>
<l>You fall a victim to alternate spoilers;</l>
<l>Hence, with paternal tenderness, he wishes</l>
<l>T' enroll your sons among the sons of France,</l>
<l>And make the subjects of his diff'rent realms,</l>
<l>One equal, common, and united people.</l>
<l>If this be slav'ry—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>'Tis the worst of slav'ry,</l>
<l>Tamely to bend Our necks beneath the yoke,</l>
<l>And suffer fraud, to talk us out of freedom.—</l>
<l>If we must yield before superior force,</l>
<l>Let us at least deserve the name of men;</l>
<l>Let us fall nobly, if we are to fall,</l>
<l>And give the world in characters of blood,</l>
<l>Eternal causes to lament our fate,</l>
<l>But never one occasion to despise us!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>Far from my bosom be the abject thought!</l>
<l>To stoop the servile minister of greatness,</l>
<l>Or crouch the advocate for lawless pow'r:</l>
<l>The heir myself of heav'n-descended freedom,</l>
<l>I wish the same bright heritage to all.</l>
<l><pb n="18" facs="27"/>And inly scorn a brotherhood with slaves.</l>
<l>Yet sure, some form your government must know;</l>
<l>The reins of state must somewhere be devolv'd;</l>
<l>And he who holds them, name him as you please,</l>
<l>Must be your prince, and you must be his subjects,</l>
<l>Why then, if Lewis solemnly shall swear,</l>
<l>To hold your rights inviolably sacred;</l>
<l>Still to maintain the spirit of your laws,</l>
<l>And never know another line of action;</l>
<l>Why should you turn indignantly away,</l>
<l>And slight the offer of a mighty monarch,</l>
<l>Who knows that form of government is best,</l>
<l>Which best secures the welfare of the people?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Because your monarch, in this very offer,</l>
<l>Seeks to subvert our glorious constitution;</l>
<l>Seeks to erect hereditary rule,</l>
<l>Where virtue only, gives superior rank;</l>
<l>And where the genius of descended Rome,</l>
<l>Has levell'd all distinctions but in goodness.</l>
<l>What is his promise to maintain us free?</l>
<l>Sir, we'll maintain that freedom for ourselves;</l>
<l>And to maintain it, we reject your master.</l>
<l>The pow'r, so safe in his benignant hand,</l>
<l>Is safer still, retain'd within our own;</l>
<l>We know the worth of liberty too well,</l>
<l>Ever to cast the blessing basely from us,</l>
<l>Or still more basely to survive our honour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>You need not cast the mighty blessing from you.—</l>
<l>The king my master, wishes for no more,</l>
<l>Than such mere title to the realms of Venice,</l>
<l>As to his subjects and the world may warrant,</l>
<l>A warm exertion of continual care</l>
<l>For this his dear ally.—And mark, my lord; <stage>[shewing a paper.</stage> </l>
<l><pb n="19" facs="28"/>The moment Venice owns him for her sovereign,</l>
<l>This instrument confirms the viceroy's office,</l>
<l>With all the active rule, to great Anselmo</l>
<l>And his heirs for ever.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Am I awake?</l>
<l>Or can I trust my reason?—Patience—Patience!</l>
<l>Are all the bright atchievements of my life</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>No more, my lord! my king I see has err'd,</l>
<l>In off'ring peace and happiness to Venice.</l>
<l>Yet let me mourn for you, her wretched race!</l>
<l>Her slaughter'd sons, and violated virgins;</l>
<l>For you, her shrieking matrons; and for you,</l>
<l>O ye unconscious, wnoffending babes,—</l>
<l>Driv'n from your humble yet your chearful homes,</l>
<l>To timeless graves, or everlasting exile!</l>
<l>Anselmo dooms you to this dreadful fate,</l>
<l>And spurns the friendship offer'd to preserve you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Eternal curses on the baleful friendship,</l>
<l>That seeks to cheat us of our native justice!</l>
<l>And did your mean, your poorly-thinking prince</l>
<l>Suppose Anselmo would betray his country,</l>
<l>Hang up his name to everlasting scorn.</l>
<l>And sell the brightest birthright of a people,</l>
<l>To gain a robber's portion of the plunder!</l>
<l>What cou'd repay me for internal peace,</l>
<l>Or give distinction where I sold my honour?</l>
<l>The wildest prodigal the world can know,</l>
<l>Is he who madly casts away his virtue;</l>
<l><pb n="20" facs="29"/>And tho' he gains a sceptre in return,</l>
<l>He's still a wretched loser by the change—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GRANVILLE.</speaker>
<l>Enough, my lord; we end our conf'rence here.—</l>
<l>Venice, 'tis true, admires the good Anselmo,</l>
<l>And trusts her present safety to his wisdom;—</l>
<l>Yet if his fellow-citizens shall hear,</l>
<l>How light their happiness is held, when weigh'd</l>
<l>In glory's grand, tho' too romantic scale,</l>
<l>Well may they mourn this honourable madness,</l>
<l>This dread, thro' bright, delirium of the mind,</l>
<l>Which seeks for safety in assur'd destruction,</l>
<l>And blindly murders nations to preserve them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Whene'er they shew such turpitude of soul,</l>
<l>Make them again an offer of your chains!—</l>
<l>But now, the purport of your business o'er,</l>
<l>And public character thrown wholly off,</l>
<l>In the plain province of a private man,</l>

<l>He'll not disdain the dwelling of Anselmo!</l>

<l>From Ferdinand!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>From him, Adorno.—But observe his words!—</l>
<l>"Touch'd with the various miseries of Venice,</l>
<l>The first of Europe's kings salutes the senate;</l>
<l>And offers peace, nay friendship to their realms,</l>
<l>Peace uncondition'd, and eternal friendship."</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADORNO.</speaker>
<l>What! has the royal ruffian been inform'd</l>
<l>That France has sued us to become her subject;</l>
<l>And does he, fearful of our base assent,</l>
<l>Fearful his rival shou'd obtain our homage,</l>
<l>Give up his own despotic claim upon us,</l>
<l>And rather choose to set us wholly free,</l>
<l>Than see his foe acknowledg'd for our master?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Too plain.—Perdition on his recreant head!</l>
<l>His motive may be seen.—Too plain, his fears</l>
<l>Wou'd now usurp the guise of high-soul'd virtue:</l>
<l>But tho' we know the source of this proposal,</l>
<l>Tho' we are certain that his late defeats,</l>
<l>Join'd to his dread of our receiving Lewis,</l>
<l><pb n="25" facs="34"/>Have dragg'd the trembling tyrant from his throne,</l>
<l>To dastard supplication—still his offers</l>
<l>Demand our prompt acceptance—he consents</l>
<l>To yield up all our towns—our captive sons—</l>
<l>To cease for ever his detested claim,</l>
<l>And treat us henceforth, as a sep'rate nation,</l>
<l>A dear ally, but independent people.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADORNO.</speaker>
<l>But say, my lord, what minister he sends,</l>
<l>To sign these terms of unexpected peace?</l>
<l>Fraud and the royal hypocrite are one;</l>
<l>Nor can we trust securely to his word,</l>
<l>When once his int'rest urges him to break it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>That very int'rest is our hostage now—</l>
<l>And here too, conscious of our glad concurrence,</l>
<l>He speeds his Alva to confirm the treaty;</l>
<l>Who comes beneath safe-conduct from Colonna,</l>
<l>(Supplying now my absence in the fleet)</l>
<l>And will arrive at Venice ere the eve.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADORNO.</speaker>
<l>So soon?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>So says the letter.—But, my friend,</l>

<l>Within an hour I'll meet them at Saint Mark's;</l>
<l>There, when our peace is happily restor'd,</l>

<l>Joy to my son!—to Venice boundless joy!—</l>

<l>An angel's tongue.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l><pb n="26" facs="35"/>And I have news, that howl'd</l>
<l>In deepest hell, wou'd make the demons tremble.—</l>
<l>Clementina—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Ha! what of her, Palermo?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>Is false, persidious—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>How?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>Doats on another!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Beware, Palermo, this capricious temper!</l>
<l>Doubt seldom lodges in a noble mind;</l>
<l>And he scarce merits to be treated justly,</l>
<l>Whose jealous soul, on light foundation, questions</l>
<l>Th' unsullied lustre of another's virtue—</l>
<l>Retract then quick this hasty accusation,</l>
<l>And kindly say my hapless child is dead,</l>
<l>But dare not once to tell me she is worthless!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>On light foundation did I doubt, my lord,</l>
<l>This sharp reproach had been indeed deserv'd;</l>
<l>But if incessant coldness, if contempt,</l>
<l>If open insult for protesting love,</l>
<l>And ev'n a noon-day fondness for a stranger,</l>
<l>Are honest grounds of rational suspicion,</l>
<l>Then have I cause for rage and indignation—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>By heav'n, 'tis false! nor shall my child be wrong'd</l>
<l>By any coinage of a dotard's madness;</l>
<l><pb n="27" facs="36"/>Her soul, superior to the sland'rous charge,</l>
<l>Has prov'd its worth to more than Roman greatness;</l>
<l>And if she meant not to accept your vows,</l>
<l>Her sense—her pride—her virtue had repuls'd them</l>
<l>—Fond of a stranger—Tell me, Sir—what stranger,</l>
<l>What mighty object has alarm'd your fears,</l>
<l>And kindled hell's most fiercely blazing fire,</l>
<l>The fire of groundless jealousy within you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>Why will Anselmo treat me with contempt,</l>
<l>And wound the wounded with the darts of scorn?</l>
<l>Think you I rave, or that my restless brain,</l>
<l>Ingenious, seeks out sources of misfortune?</l>
<l>But what if hid within yon secret arbour</l>
<l>You shou'd yourself detect them—what if there</l>
<l>You knew them long conceal'd? What if you saw</l>
<l>Her alabaster arm, as I have seen it,</l>
<l>O damning sight! thrown round the happy villain,</l>
<l>Wou'd you not then with me conclude her lost,</l>
<l>And think this ample evidence to prove</l>
<l>The plain perdition of her monstrous falshood?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>And were you, Sir, like me, a father,</l>
<l>Like me, a doating father—had your child</l>
<l>Thro' life maintain'd an unsuspected honour,</l>
<l>And rose in virtue as she rose in beauty;</l>
<l>Wou'd you believe, at reason's full meridian,</l>
<l>A maid thus pure, thus eminently spotless,</l>
<l>Cou'd plunge at once in infamy eternal,</l>
<l>And set fame, fortune, happiness at nought,</l>
<l>Thro' instant passion for a total stranger?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>My Lord, I come not with an idiot's tale,</l>
<l>Or wish Anselmo in an angry mood</l>
<l>Shou'd, as an insant, chide a thoughtless daughter:</l>
<l><pb n="28" facs="37"/>No; I disdain the thought—I come to guard</l>
<l>No less his honour than my own—to shew</l>
<l>Our mutual danger—and advise, that Granville</l>
<l>May be this moment order'd to his France—</l>
<l>As yet, tho' highly erring, Clementina</l>
<l>Cannot be compleatly guilty—Send, then,</l>
<l>Her new-found fav'rite instantly from Venice—</l>
<l>She still is undestroy'd; and Granville,</l>
<l>Tho' thrice my sword avengingly was drawn,</l>
<l>Safe from this arm, enjoys the law of nations.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Rash—desp'rate youth, forbear to urge my temper—</l>
<l>Or, by yon heav'n, the friendship which I hold you,</l>
<l>No more o'erlooks this treatment of my child—</l>
<l>She false—She shameless—Kneel, blasphemer, kneel,</l>
<l>Fall at her feet, and own you've lost your reason;</l>
<l>For nought but madness can excuse the wound,</l>
<l>Which virtue feels in injur'd Clementina.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>They're in the arbour yet—convince yourself—</l>
<l>And see how far I wound the cause of virtue,</l>
<l>In this report of faithless Clementina.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>I will this instant—But remember, Sir,</l>
<l>Unless your charge proceeds from some mistake</l>
<l>Of probable appearance—unless it springs</l>
<l>From some plain source of obvious misconception,</l>
<l>The purpos'd union never shall take place—</l>
<l>I prize my child's repose too dearly, Sir,</l>
<l>To trust it with a madman—Nor will she</l>

<l>Polluted, stain'd, nay prostitute before me?</l>
<l>Do I not take, O torture! to my arms,</l>

<l>Of flaming will, and burning expectation?</l>
<l>Will not this fiend, damnation on him, Granville,</l>
<l>Will he not dart like light'ning to her memory,</l>
<l>And fire her fancy ev'n—O hold my brain—</l>
<l>Let me avoid the mere imagination—</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>WELL, my Palermo—this unlook'd-for rival</l>
<l>Ploughs back his way to France.</l>
<l>I saw his canvass whitening on the breeze,</l>
<l>As well to know him certainly departed,</l>
<l>As to restrain the fury of the people,</l>
<l>Who, fir'd with honest, tho' misguided zeal,</l>
<l>Forgot his sanctity of public character,</l>
<l>And rav'd for vengeance on a foe to freedom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>The people's voice, howe'er it sometimes errs,</l>
<l>Means always nobly, and is rais'd by virtue;</l>
<l>Their very faults, illustrious from their motives,</l>
<l>Demand respect, nay, ask for admiration,</l>
<l>And soar, at least, half sanctify'd to justice—</l>
<l>There—hear their voice—'tis now swell'd up with rapture,</l>
<l>Alva, the welcome minister of peace,</l>
<l>Excites their joy, and ev'ry order hails</l>
<l>The white-wing'd moment, that preserves the state,</l>
<l>And crowns the gen'rous labours of Anselmo.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>He comes, e'en earlier than my utmost hope,</l>
<l>And proves how much his sovereign was alarm'd</l>
<l><pb n="39" facs="48"/>At the now lucky embassy from Lewis—</l>
<l>Come, my Palermo, let us hasten hence!</l>
<l>And shew due honour to the noble Alva!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>Fain would I greet him; but alas, my gloom</l>
<l>Would chill the pleasure which it meant to grace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Remain then here—I wou'd not have it said</l>
<l>That aught cou'd wound a citizen of Venice</l>
<l>Who liv'd to see his liberty restor'd.</l>
<l>I am the father of that wretched girl,</l>
<l>Who clouds your brow with grief and disappointment;</l>
<l>I am, and feel her conduct like a father:</l>
<l>But when I think upon the countless millions,</l>
<l>Which this unlook'd-for providence of heav'n</l>
<l>Designs to bless, I cast away my griefs,</l>
<l>And in my country, strive to lose my daughter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>Your spirit fires me—I adopt its justice,</l>
<l>And will attempt, if possible, myself</l>
<l>To loose all memory of this sweet deceiver.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Do—and be dearer to my heart than ever—</l>
<l>Your worth first made you mine; the same, that worth,</l>
<l>Shall keep you—Clementina now is sunk</l>
<l>Below your thought; to wed her would be baseness.</l>
<l>Despise her, therefore, as you prize my friendship,</l>
<l>And know I'd scorn to give a shameless woman,</l>
<l>Tho' ten times mine, to any man of honour. <stage>[Exit.</stage> </l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>He's right—he's right—I were a slave indeed,</l>
<l>A soul-less slave, to prostitute a thought,</l>
<l>A single thought, on such a woman longer—</l>
<l>Were she as fair as luxury has painted</l>
<l><pb n="40" facs="51"/>The nymphs of Paradise to Eastern minds,</l>
<l>I ought to spurn her now—Her heart is lost—</l>
<l>'Tis all debas'd by this licentious passion,</l>
<l>And he who weds the object of his scorn,</l>
<l>May boast of love, but never talk of honour— <stage>[Exit.</stage> </l>

<sp>
<speaker>ADORNO.</speaker>
<l>Now is the time, my friends, to press him close,</l>
<l>And make him wholly sov'reign of the state;</l>
<l>Which his great talents and unequal virtue</l>
<l>Have thus so happily, so nobly sav'd—</l>
<l>The nations round us, owe their chiefest strength</l>
<l>To regal government—How were we torn</l>
<l>With jarring int'rests till the rule supreme,</l>
<l>To one great arm was trusted—to Anselmo!</l>
<l>France—Ferdinand—and ev'ry pow'rful neighbour,</l>
<l>May still divide us with their sep'rate factions:</l>
<l>But if we choose a monarch of our own,</l>
<l>His and the public welfare must be one.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>First <hi>CITIZEN.</hi></speaker>
<l>Is he acquainted with our views, Adorno?</l>
<l>Have you inform'd him of our grateful purpose?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADORNO.</speaker>
<l>No—For I fear'd his stern disapprobation,</l>
<l>And only hope the people's gen'ral voice</l>
<l>Will now induce him to accept a throne.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Second <hi>CITIZEN.</hi></speaker>

<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l><pb n="41" facs="52"/>Well, my brave countrymen!</l>
<l>I once more see you free; the solemn league</l>
<l>Is happily concluded; and to heaven</l>
<l>Our deepest thanks we gratefully must pour</l>
<l>For life, for peace, for liberty immortal!</l>
<l>Here now my labour and commission end.</l>
<l>This sacred sword, the badge of sov'reign pow'r,</l>
<l>Which in the storms and perils of the state,</l>
<l>Your gen'ral voice entrusted to my care,</l>
<l>And bade me carry as your common leader,</l>
<l>'Till death or freedom finish'd my command,</l>
<l>This sacred pledge becomes your own again—</l>
<l>Here to your use I solemnly resign it,</l>
<l>And sink with transport, to a private station;</l>
<l>More proud the subject of a free-born state,</l>
<l>Than if I rul'd a universe of slaves—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADORNO.</speaker>
<l>My lord Anselmo, your applauding country</l>
<l>Gives back the sword to that experienc'd hand,</l>
<l>Which crowns her sons with liberty and peace:</l>
<l>Thro' me she offers you a crown, a throne,</l>
<l>And hails her monarch, in her great preserver.</l>
<l>Start not!—with me the gen'ral voice cries out,</l>
<l>Long live our king—long live the good Anselmo. <stage>[A flourish.</stage> </l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Shall I with thanks, or deep-struck indignation,</l>
<l>With grateful heart, or justly kindled ire,</l>
<l>Receive this flatt'ring instance of your favour?</l>
<l>Warm to the voice of virtuous approbation,</l>
<l>I feel a joy beyond the pow'r of words,</l>
<l>To find my actions honour'd with your praise:</l>
<l>But in the rising raptures of the man,</l>
<l><pb n="42" facs="53"/>The honest citizen must do his duty;</l>
<l>He must refuse, resentingly refuse,</l>
<l>Th' unthinking bounty, which to pay his service,</l>
<l>Wou'd plunge his country in immediate bondage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADORNO.</speaker>
<l>This self-denying dignity of soul,</l>
<l>Serves but to shew the wisdom of our choice,</l>
<l>And proves how safe a confidence repos'd,</l>
<l>Will lodge in hands so worthy as Anselmo's.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Long, my brave friends, against the Spanish tyrant,</l>
<l>Have the exalted citizens of Venice</l>
<l>Fought the great cause of justice and mankind:</l>
<l>And will you now, triumphant over force,</l>
<l>From downright gratitude embrace a chain?</l>
<l>What has your glorious, fortitude effected,</l>
<l>If in the full fraught transport of your souls,</l>
<l>You lift the man you fondly call deliverer,</l>
<l>To sov'reign rule, and crown him for your master?</l>
<l>In such a case your blessing is your, bane,</l>
<l>And Spain, a foe less deadly than Anselmo.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADORNO.</speaker>
<l>Does not the use which you have made of pow'r,</l>
<l>Proclaim how much, how amply we shou'd trust you.</l>
<l>Have you employ'd it, but for public good,</l>
<l>Or wish'd to keep it, when that good was answer'd?</l>
<l>Hear then your grateful countrymen, and know</l>
<l>Adorno speaks the wishes of the people,</l>
<l>The people's wishes joyfully conven'd,</l>
<l>Who with one voice now offer you a kingdom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>I scorn the kingdom that can court a tyrant,</l>
<l>And while I live my country shall be free.</l>
<l>If then my voice deserves the least attention,</l>
<l>Let me exhort, nay, shame you from your purpose.</l>
<l><pb n="43" facs="54"/>I fought to save you from despotic pow'r,</l>
<l>Not, giddy men, to be myself your lord:</l>
<l>You may forget your duty to the state,</l>
<l>But I'll remember mine, and keep all equal,</l>
<l>Tho' I myself am singled out for master.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>First <hi>CITIZEN.</hi></speaker>
<l>We'll urge the point no more.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADORNO.</speaker>
<l>I ne'er had urg'd it,</l>
<l>But for the public welfare, from belief,</l>
<l>That all rewards were properly his due,</l>
<l>Whose arm and wisdom had preserv'd our freedom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Rewards, Adorno! talk not of rewards—</l>
<l>The man is half a traitor to the state,</l>
<l>Who only serves it from a sordid motive—</l>
<l>Yet, if too warm, too rude in my refusal,</l>
<l>I give offence to any son of Venice,</l>
<l>Here I abjure th' intention of offending,</l>
<l>And beg my kind, my too indulgent friends,</l>
<l>May now disperse, and seek their several homes—</l>
<l>Who most loves freedom, will keep order most;</l>
<l>And know, the best way each can serve his country,</l>
<l>Is to hold tumult in a deep abhorrence,</l>
<l>And labour closely in his private station.</l>

<l>Lo there—the phrenzy of a nation's virtue!</l>
<l>Who cou'd abuse their elevated weakness?</l>
<l>Curse on the despicable slave that cou'd!—</l>
<l>Curse on the slave, however he possesses</l>
<l>A nation's confidence, whose grov'ling interest,</l>
<l><pb n="44" facs="55"/>Or abject pride, can tempt him to betray it!</l>
<l>The more his weight, his merit with a country,</l>
<l>The more he's bound, by ev'ry tye of honour,</l>
<l>To guard the laws; and he's a double villain,</l>
<l>When once he vilely turns that very power,</l>
<l>Which he derives from popular esteem,</l>
<l>To sap the bulwarks of the public freedom.</l>
<stage>Enter an Officer.</stage>

<speaker>OFFICER.</speaker>
<l>To tell my lord Anselmo,</l>
<l>That Granville's vessel, which so late you forc'd</l>
<l>To sea, has unexpectedly borne back,</l>
<l>And seems to steer directly for the point</l>
<l>Which bounds the palace-garden from the surge—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Where is my daughter?—Where is Clementina?</l>
<l>I've scarcely left a soldier at the palace,</l>
<l>Sole tho' it stands, and sep'rate from the city—</l>
<l>Hence quick, and seize on Granville, if he lands.</l>
<l>Take ample force—My soul forebodes his purpose— <stage>[Exit Officer.</stage> </l>
<l>Yet shou'd he dare—by heaven's high host he dies—</l>
<l>No character can sanctify such outrage—</l>

<l>Nay, for your own sake, give me up, Palermo;</l>
<l>Give me again my former peace of mind,</l>
<l><pb n="45" facs="56"/>Give me again, my father's dear regards,</l>
<l>Of which your fatal passion has depriv'd me:</l>
<l>O prideless lord, tho' dead to my repose,</l>
<l>At least reflect and tremble for your own.</l>
<l>What peace, what comfort ever can you hope</l>
<l>From one, not only sickening at your sight,</l>
<l>But hear, and fly me—doating on another—</l>
<l>To madness doating—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>O, I know it well—</l>
<l>Your once-seen Granville, light capricious beauty!</l>
<l>And seen too, while your plighted vow to me</l>
<l>Was yet all warm, and flying up to heaven!</l>
<l>For him you trampled on your sacred promise;</l>
<l>For this light Frenchman, in a single moment,</l>
<l>Broke ev'ry rosy nicety of sex,</l>
<l>And at a word, a glance—nay, without either—</l>
<l>Lost a whole life of innocence and honour.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEMENTINA.</speaker>
<l>Licentious railer—therefore give me up!</l>
<l>Nought but contention, wretchedness, and shame,</l>
<l>Can wait a union circumstanc'd like ours:</l>
<l>Thro' life our fiend-like fury to each other,</l>
<l>Must make our home the dwelling of despair;</l>
<l>And after death, our still opposing spirits,</l>
<l>If after death our enmity can live,</l>
<l>With those in story of the Thaeban brothers,</l>
<l>Will shun all commerce, and as hating here,</l>
<l>Diffuse their hate throughout the whole hereafter.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PALERMO.</speaker>
<l>Swell not the picture with a needless horror,</l>
<l>Nor once imagine that my soul requires</l>
<l>Such striking pleas to shun an obvious baseness—</l>
<l>Think you I mean, persisting in my claim—</l>
<l>To seize a hand that justice bids me scorn;</l>
<l>No: I despise the meanness, and intend</l>
<l><pb n="46" facs="57"/>Not to assert my title, but resign it;</l>
<l>I am a lover,—yet I'm still a man;</l>
<l>Acquainted therefore with the blotted mind,</l>

<l>And wed distraction sooner than dishonour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEMENTINA.</speaker>
<l>Blest may you be for this exalted scorn,</l>
<l>This noble warmth of manly indignation,</l>
<l>Dearer to me than all the melting strains</l>

<l>Lose the poor comforts of a wife's attendance?</l>
<l>Where is the mighty freedom of your state,</l>
<l>Where your strict love of liberty and justice?</l>
<l>Why, say, O why, ye too benignant pow'rs!</l>
<l>Did you from ruin snatch this barbarous realm,</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANSELMO.</speaker>
<l>Blaspheming monster—stop that impious tongue,</l>

<l>At my request, th' assembling senate now</l>
<l>Prepare to hear his crime, and will pronounce</l>

<l>Stay, Anselmo, stay—</l>

<l>If I reveal him—Which way shall I act?</l>
<l>The lab'ring globe convulsing to its base,</l>

<l>I did—I did—and felt it most severely—</l>

<l>Stood desperately fix'd, while on each cheek,</l>
<l>Each pallid cheek, a single tear hung quiv'ring,</l>
<l>Like early dew-drops on the sick'ning lily,</l>

</sp>

<l>I'll see her once again—for when I weigh</l>

<l>Nor wou'd the Tour of <hi>Europe</hi> prove our shame,</l>
<l>Cou'd every <hi>Macaroni</hi> do the same.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The City's self—a wonder, all agree—</l>
<l>Appears to spring, like <hi>Venus,</hi> from the sea.</l>
<l>Founded on piles, it rises from the strand,</l>
<l>Like Trifle plac'd upon a silver stand:</l>
<l>While many a lesser isle the prospect crowns,</l>
<l>Looking like sugar plums, or floating towns.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Horses and mules ne'er pace the narrow street,</l>
<l>Where crouded walkers elbow all they meet:</l>
<l>No carts and coaches o'er the pavement clatter;</l>
<l>Ladies, Priests, Lawyers, Nobles,—go by water:</l>
<l>Light boats and gondolas transport them all,</l>
<l>Like one eternal party to <hi>Vauxhall.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now hey for merriment!—hence gries and sear!</l>
<l>The jolly Carnival leads in the year;</l>
<l><pb n="66" facs="79"/>Calls the young Loves and Pleasures to its aid;</l>
<l>A three-months jubilee and masquerade!</l>
<l>With gaiety the throng'd piazza glows,</l>
<l>Mountebanks, jugglers, boxers, puppet-shows:</l>
<l>Mask'd and disguis'd the ladies meet their sparks,</l>
<l>While <hi>Venus</hi> bails the mummers of <hi>St. Mark's.</hi></l>
<l>There holy friars turn gallants, and there too</l>
<l>Nuns yield to all the frailties—"Flesh is heir to."</l>
<l>There dear Ridottos constantly delight,</l>
<l>And sweet Harmonic Meetings ev'ry night!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Once in each year the <hi>Doge</hi> ascends his barge,</l>
<l>Fine as a <hi>London</hi> Mayor's, and thrice as large;</l>
<l>Throws a huge ring of gold into the sea,</l>
<l>And cries—"Thus We, thy Sov'reign, marry thee.</l>
<l>Oh may'st thou ne'er, like many a mortal spouse,</l>
<l>Prove full of storms, and faitbless to thy vows!"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>One word of politics—and then Pve done—</l>
<l>The state of <hi>Venice</hi> Nobles rule alone.</l>
<l>Thrice happy <hi>Britain,</hi> where with equal band</l>
<l>Three well pois'd states unite to rule the land!</l>
<l>Thus in the theatre, as well as state.</l>
<l>Three ranks must join to make us bless'd and great.</l>
<l>King, Lords, and Commons, o'er the nation sit;</l>
<l>Pit, Box, and Gallery, rule the realms of wit.</l>
