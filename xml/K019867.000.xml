<p>THE spectator and reader of the following performance, will find the manners and customs of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> introduced, as appertaining to the <hi>first discovered natives</hi> of the western world.—This deviation afforded the author an opportunity of introducing manners and customs, more congenial to dramatic use, and more particularly of presenting from MARMONTEL'S INCAS, the pathetic tale of <hi>Cora</hi> and <hi>Alonzo.</hi></p>
<p>To MR. HARRIS, the author offers his acknowledgments for the extreme attention he has paid to this performance, and the magnificent decorations he has bestowed on it.</p>
<p>For the zeal and talent, manifested by the performers, the author's best thanks are due.—</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>WRITTEN BY W. T. FITZGERALD, ESQ. SPOKEN BY MR. HOLMAN.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>WHEN famed Columbus nobly dared to brave,</l>
<l>The untry'd perils of the Western wave;</l>
<l>Ten thousand dangers in his passage lay,</l>
<l>Dark was his night, and dreary was his day!</l>
<l>The rude companions of his bold design,</l>
<l>Fatigued with toil, against their chief combine:</l>
<l>When sudden—bursting on th' astonish'd view!</l>
<l>A world discovered, proved his judgment true.—</l>
<l>"Yet black ingratitude, the Great Man's fate!</l>
<l>"Pursued Columbus with envenomed hate;</l>
<l>"But minds like his a base degenerate race,</l>
<l>"Might meanly persecute—but not disgrace:</l>
<l>"The noble soul its energy maintains,</l>
<l>"In spite of dungeons, tyranny, and chains."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The sons of Europe found a guileless race,</l>
<l>No fraud was veiled beneath the smiling face;</l>
<l>Their manners, mild, benevolent, and kind,</l>
<l>Pourtrayed the cloudless sunshine of the mind:</l>
<l>Bless'd in their Prince's patriarchal reign,</l>
<l>Whose power relieved, but ne'er inflicted pain,</l>
<l>Their placid lives no fancy'd evils knew;</l>
<l>Their joys were many, and their wants were few.</l>
<l>One custom with their virtues ill agreed,</l>
<l>Which made Humanity with anguish bleed;</l>
<l>Compelled at Superstition's shrine to bow,</l>
<l>The hapless victims of a cruel vow!</l>
<l><pb facs="5"/>Their sweetest maids were often doomed to prove,</l>
<l>No joy in friendship, nor no bliss in love!</l>
<l>Yet love and nature cannot be supprest,</l>
<l>The sigh will heave, and palpitate the breast;</l>
<l>For spite of vows, which Heaven's wise laws disown,</l>
<l>Love sits triumphant on the heart—his throne!</l>
<l>And breaks those fetters bigots would impose,</l>
<l>To aggravate the sense of human woes!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The rigid laws of time, and place, our bard,</l>
<l>In this night's drama, ventures to discard:</l>
<l>If here he errs—he errs with <hi>him</hi> whose name,</l>
<l>Stands without rival on the rolls of Fame;</l>
<l><hi>Him</hi> whom the passions own with one accord,</l>
<l>Their Great Dictator, and despotic Lord!</l>
<l>Who placed aloft on Inspiration's throne,</l>
<l>Made Fancy's magic kingdom all his own,</l>
<l>Burst from the trammels which his muse confined,</l>
<l>And poured the wealth of his exhaustless mind!</l>
<l>Though SHAKSPEARE'S flight no mortal shall pursue—</l>
<l>COLUMBUS' story patronized by you,</l>
<l>Will yield an off'ring, grateful to his dust—</l>
<l>A British laurel on a hero's bust!</l>

<head>ACT I.</head>
<div3 n="1" type="scene">
<head>SCENE I.—</head><stage><hi>On one side of the stage a flight of steps, with a Portico leading to the Temple of the Sun.—In the background the sea. Time, sun-rise.</hi></stage>
<stage>Catalpo <hi>and Priests from the Temple, who range themselves—then enter</hi> Orozimbo—<hi>they bow to him as he passes.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>OROZIMBO</speaker><stage>, <hi>prostrating himself to the sun.</hi></stage>
<p>SOUL of the universe, who from they glittering throne beamest immortal splendour, as thou hast permitted the stars for their appointed hour to bespangle the veil of night, now o'erwhelm all manner of glories in the greatness of thy effulgence, and be once more welcom'd by thy devoted servants to delight and bless the world!—Catalpo, conduct hither the virgin destined to receive a priestess' sacred office.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="2" facs="8"/>CATALPO <hi>exit, and re-enters with</hi> SOLASCO, <hi>leading in</hi> CORA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Solasco </speaker>
<stage>(kneels.)</stage>
<p>Mighty chief!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimba.</speaker>
<p>Rise, good Solasco.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Solasco.</speaker>
<p>I here present the darling of my age to be devoted to the service of our god. It will be worse than parting with my life to lose the comforts of her dear society—but the bright sun, our glorious deity, demands such excellence to be consigned alone to do <hi>him</hi> honour.—Pardon, my king, an old man's tears; but nature will not always, without a struggle, yield to duty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>Thou hast, indeed, devoted to thy god a precious treasure; but tell me, Cora, can thy youthful mind freely resign the livelier joys of social life, and rest contented in seclusion and tranquillity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cora.</speaker>
<p>My father's will has ever sway'd my thoughts, from the first hour that infant sense cou'd learn obedience:—Should he doom my death, his mandate would be met with equal resignation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>Thy pious mind, which knows to yield such duty to a father, will well befit the service of thy god.—But hear the sacred tenour of the law which binds a priestess to her duty.— Should the heart, to heaven devoted, become the prey of sacrilegious love, our law consigns its priestess, and the accomplice of her guilt, to instant death. Her parents and their offspring are pledges for her faith, and should her flight elude offended justice, their forfeit lives must expiate her crime. <stage>[Cora <hi>bows to the sun.</hi>]</stage> Now to the altar, and record your vows; then, as our custom is, come forth to shine Queen of this festive day,
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>the last you are to know exempt from sacred duty.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exeunt</hi> Cora, Solasco, <hi>and</hi> Priests, <hi>to the Temple.</hi></stage>
<stage>During the latter part of this scene the sun becomes obscured by clouds, and thunder and lightning issue from them—the sea much agitated.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Catalpho.</speaker>
<p>Great chief, behold what envious clouds obscure the glories of our god.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>Say, Catalpo, what mean these bodings! <stage>A ship appears from behind a projecting rock.</stage> And lo!—What monster's that, whose wings bear it buoyant on the angry main?</p>
</sp>
<stage>A cannon is discharged from the ship.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Catalpo.</speaker>
<p>See!—From its throat thunder and fire burst forth, seeming to brave high heaven.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>Be not dismay'd—summon our warriors. <stage>[<hi>to</hi> Cuto.]</stage> Catalpo, let the priests attend.</p>

<p>My people, we'll to the shore— Should they prove mortal foes, we'll meet their thunders, or if the engines of infernal power, what can virtue fear?—Trust me, the Deity we serve, will re-assume his splendour, and protect his chosen people.</p>

<head>SCENE IV.</head><stage><hi>The Sea Coast.</hi></stage>
<stage>Three Ships are seen at anchor, and Boats come to Shore with martial Music and Colours flying.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter from the Boat,</hi> Columbus, Alonzo, Roldan, Valverdo, Harry Herbert, <hi>and the rest of the Spanish Adventurers.</hi>—Columbus <hi>lands first, with his Sword drawn—he falls and embraces the Earth, during which Time there are three Cheers, and a discharge of Artillery; then the rest follow and come forward.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>First, to high Heaven, who thus, with never-fading honour, hath crown'd its poorest servant, let me pour forth a heart o'erwhelm'd with gratitude. And now begin the important work which heaven has delegated to us—Erect the sacred banner of our faith.</p>
<stage>The Cross is erected on one side of the stage.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Brave associates! join with me in praise of him, who hath atchiev'd what ignorance, with sapient shrug, and satisfied, benumbing prudence derided as the chimera of a madman's fancy: falling at his feet, let us be proud in being first to pay due homage to such surpassing excellence.</p>
<stage>They all kneel.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>Rise, rise;—rather, my Alonzo, in these arms receive my thanks, thou, next to heaven, my firmest friend. Ye men of Spain, let what has passed admonish you in what may be to come—keep in your minds the time when we had gained the course which shut out the eastern world; how you beat your breasts, oppressed
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>with fear and superstition—How, with womanish tears, you bade adieu to life, and blubbered out a requiem for your souls; then embracing desperation instead of fortitude, I was to be your sacrifice; and this body, which has been your conduct to wealth and honour, you would have given to the sea, and ignorance and cowardice would have triumphed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Valverdo.</speaker>
<p>Mighty Sir, forgive us!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>Freely, good Valverdo—Let the man stand forth, who, at a time so fraught with peril, first discovered land.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert. </speaker>
<stage>[Coming forward.]</stage>
<p>It was my good fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>Thou art not a Spaniard.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>No, your Excellency, I am an Englishman; and tho' we Englishmen are an odd, whimsical set of fellows, yet we generally contrive (and I trust ever shall) to keep a good look out a-head when our superior is in danger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>Tell me your fortunes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>My name is Harry Herbert; I am descended from as respectable and independent an ancestor as the world can boast, — an English yeoman; but the civil wars leaving my family little, which my imprudence soon made less, I thought that, altho' King Henry was deprived of the honour of this enterprize, that did not preclude his subjects; so I shipped myself off for Castille, where I had just time and cash enough to fall a dozen times in love, and into other serapes, before I had the honour of embarking on board your Excellency's squadron.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>Herbert, thou dost honour to thy country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Then, Sir, I am glad, that for once I
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>am even with it; for I am sure my country does honour to me.</p>
<stage>Indian music without.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>Behold a crowd of people, many of whom seem clad in sacred vestments—Their dress and standards bespeak them greatly civilized, and full of wealth.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter in procession Indian Warriors, bearing a Standard of the Sun</hi>—Orozimbo, Cora, &amp;c.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo. </speaker>
<stage>[Descends from his car.]</stage>
<p>Strangers, who seem to be above the race of mortals, instruct us how to honour you—If you be children of the Sun, behold our priests, who with perfumes and libations, will welcome you to his holy temple; or, if human, here are fruits to feed you, dwellings to shelter you, and garments to clothe you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>Chief, you behold in us the children of mortality; but the power we serve, in his high mercy, has bestowed upon us superior gifts; thus, thro' unknown seas to brave the imperious surge, and to construct engines which can sweep thousands from the earth—But that Deity commands us to proclaim his name with peace—The King, our master, wishes to enrich thee and himself —this hardy metal, useful in all the purposes of life, he will exchange for those thy country may produce.</p>
<stage>Presents a hatchet.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>'Tis very strange—Thy King much wrongs himself—all we have to render is our gold, but that we find so yielding, and so useless, it were an injury to offer it—Indulge the curiosity of a stranger.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Orozimbo, <hi>with</hi> Columbus, Roldan, Herbert, Nelti, Catalpo, <hi>&amp;c. move up the stage.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Oft has a tender glance escap'd my eye, impell'd by Beauty's power, and from my bosom
<pb n="7" facs="13"/>the soft sigh instinctively has stolen—Many a fair Castilian has enforced this test of admiration, but now my every sense seems drawn by power magnetic to that lovely saint—Permit me, fairest creature, to express my admiration at the charms which now present themselves—tho' all the wonders of a new discovered world display their rival novelties, yet, now that I behold its first of wonders, all else exacts from me as little notice, as I, I fear, have power or merit to command from you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cora.</speaker>
<p>Strange you wrong yourself, and hold me unskilful to distinguish, when you suppose desert like yours can pass unnoticed—Your praises of the humble Cora, tho' they have caused no vain emotion, yet ever will the mind receive with pleasure, praise e'en unmerited, when 'tis bestowed by those who claim our admiration.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>All that the warmest fancy can depict in the bright colours of ideal excellence, can never reach that exquisite perfection nature exhibits —how must I bless my happy fortune, that bore me to a clime which boasts an ornament like thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cora. </speaker>
<stage>[Aside.]</stage>
<p>What new emotion rises in my breast—I fear to ask my heart from whence it springs. Oh, Cora! think of thy sacred duty— think of the vow which pass'd thy lips so lately.— Stranger, tho' sacred hospitality commanded me to pay this courtesy, yet now a higher duty enjoins me to desist from further converse.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Let me entreat one instant—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cora.</speaker>
<p>It must not be—my conduct is controlled by rigid laws. Farewell.—Oh Cora, what days of wretchedness art thou doom'd to suffer!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Aside, as she retires to the priests. Alonzo.</stage>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>What cou'd she mean? "Her conduct is controlled by rigid laws"—If she be destined to another, my lot is misery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo</speaker>
<stage>[with <hi>Columbus,</hi> coming forward.]</stage>
<p>In harmony and peace I rule a free and happy people, and I were unworthy of my kingdom, did I not endeavour to the utmost to convert the name of stranger into friend.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>[Exeunt</hi> Orozimbo <hi>and</hi> Columbus, <hi>hand in hand; Priests follow; then</hi> Alonzo, Roldan, Valverdo, &amp;c. <hi>and the Spanish and Indian soldiers —One party bow to the cross, the other to the sun.]</hi></stage>
<stage><hi>Manent</hi> Herbert <hi>and</hi> Nelti.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>And so, my pretty Indian, you live very happily.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Yes, all the day long.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>And have you no monks who pray for you, dispute with you, and burn you alive when you don't think as they do?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Oh! no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Poor devils, what a way they must be in.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Don't you come from the other world?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>What, you see something angelic about me, eh!—Yes, my love, I come from a little paradise, call'd England.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Is England a world?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>A bit of one; but, little as it is, it somehow contrives to manage all the rest.— Shou'd you like to live in England?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>O yes; I suppose English women, arm'd with spears made of that pretty, hard iron, climb the mountains, and destroy the wild bull.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Destroy the wild bull! No, my dear; our English women find prettier amusement in
<pb n="9" facs="15"/>encouraging the breed of horned cattle—the use of the pretty, hard iron is confined to the men, and no great favourite there; for I know many flourishers of spontoons, who have a cursed antipathy to cold iron.—Who is that elegant creature you were conversing with?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Her name is Cora; she was this day admitted a priestess of the Sun.—The handsomest virgins are always selected to sustain that sacred office.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>The handsomest! you were then, on that account, not—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Did I say the handsomest? Oh dear, I mean they select the most sedate—for, from this day she must never leave the temple, or converse with any except the priests.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Except the priests! Go where you will, you find those gentlemen always contrive to be well taken care of—would you like to become a priestess?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti </speaker>
<stage>[sighing.]</stage>
<p>Last night perhaps I should.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Charming sensibility! and may I, my sweet girl, interpret that sigh in my favour?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Ah, you will not love me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Not love thee!—By Magna Charta, I'll resign my life, fortune, and liberty to thee.— besides, I'll bring thee beads, cloathes, music—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Ah, that is not love.—They only try to please the eye, who find their actions cannot touch the heart.—no presents or toys could influence Nelti.—no, not if you were to give her an iron javelin and a tame tiger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Indeed!—very delicate presents for a young lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti </speaker>
<stage>[aside.]</stage>
<p>I wish I cou'd make him love me— how do women in England gain their lover's hearts?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Generally by using them like dogs.— for, when a woman studiously avoids looking at
<pb n="10" facs="16"/>a man, abuses him on all occasions, and is kind to every one else, we naturally conclude they love each other to distraction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti .</speaker>
<stage>[aside]</stage>
<p>I never can find in my heart to use him ill—What ugly thing is that?</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Dolores <hi>and</hi> Bribon, <hi>from a boat.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>A doctor of physic, who having killed all his patients in the old world, except his wife, who wou'd never take his medicines, has ventured hither, in pursuit of new patients, new fees, and perhaps a new bed-fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>And what's the other?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>A lawyer and a coxcomb.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>What's a coxcomb?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>A reptile, my dear, that is found in abundance in all countries, and yet is not easily described—it is a kind of mongrel, which men drive from them, because they hardly consider it as belonging to them, and the women won't receive, because they think it won't breed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>All seems pretty quiet.—I say, Bribon—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>What do you say, Doctor Dolores?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>This seems cursed mild, wholesome, unprofitable air for a physician.—But heaven is merciful, wherever I go, patients increase.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>There seems plenty of gold, and plenty of gold, plenty of law, follows as naturally as a bill of costs.—I say, Doctor, do you see that sweet, pretty, wealthy-looking girl—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>I fancy I shall have some pretty female practice here.—I was a great favourite in Spain; for my maxim was, always to stick to my friends to the last.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Doctor, welcome to the new world.— So, you kept on board till all was quiet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="17"/>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>To be sure—consider the importance of my life to you all; but my chief reason was, that the famous astrologer, Doctor Diego Diablasco, told me something ill would happen if I were rash—but there seems no danger—that's a very pretty girl, and I love a fine young girl, almost as much as I do fine old gold</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>And have you, Doctor, so soon forgot your old helpmate in Valladolid?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Ah, poor old Dorothy! But, Lord, I hate constancy as much as I hate health <stage>[addressing Nelti.]</stage> Permit me, sweetest of savages, to enquire after the state of your health—how is your pulse? let me feel how it beats—beats.—</p>
<stage>Takes her hand.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Feel how it beats? Perhaps it beats harder than you think</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Then there's the more necessity I should feel it, my pretty, pretty—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>There, then.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Strikes him.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! a dozen such patients wou'd do for me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Doctor, I hope to be honoured with the <hi>hand</hi> of this charming girl.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Oh, with all my heart—I'm sure <hi>I've</hi> had enough of it—but you can't marry her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Why, thou professor of the glorious art of manslaughter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Because the Pope allows no religious ceremonies with hereticks—all dealings with them must be in the way of plunder and glorious intrigue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>The Pope! pshaw—I shall sit down here for life, contented with a little—I'll build a neat, convenient house, after the fashion of the country, with a plain silver door, and a diamond knocker. The apartments shall be merely lined
<pb n="12" facs="18"/>with plates of gold, neatly carved—the sophas of silver tissue, and stuffed with the down of humming-birds —As for fresco-work of emeralds, rubies, pearls, amethysts, and such nicknacks, my wife may ornament her dairy and dressing-room with them—in short, I'll have every thing in a snug, comfortable way, without shew or expence</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Without shew or expence!—Pray, great Sir, —will you allow a poor man to gather up the chips, and now and then take a peep into your <hi>golden</hi> apartments?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Why, Dolores, by the time I build, I fancy you'll have a snug <hi>leaden</hi> apartment of your own—so, go count beads instead of ducats, and try not to cheat <hi>young</hi> Harry out of his mistress, but <hi>old</hi> Harry out of your soul.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>UNGRATEFUL men, thus, in a moment, to destroy my brightest hopes.—see them closely guarded.</p>
<stage>Exeunt Soldiers, guarded.</stage>
<p>Roldan, would thou think it, those wretches (dead to prudence as to honor) have damn'd the name of Spaniard, they have reviled the Indian priests, and with unmanly outrage, have torn away the golden ornamen's that decked the lovely breasts of innocence.—The men, exasperated, call to the Cacique for vengeance; I, at the hazard of my life must follow, and appease his just resentment.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Valverdo.</speaker>
<p>Shall then a brave Castilian be disgraced with bonds, for shewing disrespect to vile idolatry?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>No, Valverdo.—Soon shall this upstart Genoese, Columbus, feel the just vengeance of insulted Spain <stage>[shewing a paper].</stage>—My brother in ambition, look on this paper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Valverdo.</speaker>
<p>What's this—the royal signature?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>Mark me.—When our gracious Queen embraced the fortunes of this foreign Viceroy,
<pb n="14" facs="20"/>even proffered her regal ornaments to equip his fleet, the minister, Fonesca, jealous of the fame that might attend this enterprise, worked on the fears of the suspicious Ferdinand, to execute this commission of control, which, now Columbus' conduct gives pretence, arrays me with the power of crushing his authority, and with disgrace returning him to Spain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Valverdo.</speaker>
<p>Glorious hearing!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>Do thou, Valverdo, tamper with the troops, —press on their superstitious minds the injury our faith will suffer by winking at idolatry; tell them, the way to sudden wealth is easy, had they a fit commander—insinuate—but we waste words—about it, good Valverdo.</p>

<sp who="#alonzo">
<p>The fatal wound is given to all my hopes—what years of bliss had my soul fondly pictured as Alonzo's lot—Oh, lovely Cora, must then thy beauties never more beam their bright radiance on me? —Had'st thou been doom'd to fill another's arms, I had indeed been cursed, but not so deeply; for I might still have gazed upon thy heavenly form —have listened to the sweet melody of thy loved voice, and known delight even in misery—But all is gloomy horror now before me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>I hope I not untimely interrupt your meditations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Roldan, the conduct of these Indians obscures our European virtues, and we are come to be instructed, not to teach—The good Columbus has appeased their just resentment, and, at the request of Orozimbo, consents to liberate the prisoners.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="21"/>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>'Tis well <stage>[shews a plan of attack]</stage> but as we must secure a place of safety (for it were madness to repose confidence in savages) here have I drawn a plan which must render the town an easy capture.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>The town a capture!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>

<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>There is no safety but in their destruction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Roldan, thou surely can'st not be so damn'd as think it—What, stab the fond heart which overflows with love and adoration for thee— trample down sacred hospitality, and erect the throne of treachery and murder—by the great God of justice, first thro' this body thou must force thy way, thou traitor to humanity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>Soft-hearted fool, these mawkish virtues have ever been the sainted garb of cowards.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>Fortune permits thee now to school me—but, boy, thou shalt feel my power; go to the Viceroy, tell him that Roldan lacketh brotherly affection for the poor Indians, and add (for by the power of vengeance it is true) that Roldan is his covenanted foe—that he hath given
<pb n="16" facs="22"/>freedom to those Castilians he dared disgrace with bonds, and that, by thee, he greets his Excellency with defiance and contempt.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit Roldan.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Perfidious, bloody villain! Oh, my friends, dangers I fear await you—I blush to say we have among us those whose vileness your pure nature cannot image. Let us prepare to meet the worst—summon your warriors, while I instruct them how best to guard each place of 'vantage—and should this Roldan attempt to execute his villainous intent, depend on the protection of Columbus.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>All happiness is mingled with alloy— I've triumphed over every opposition malice and folly raised to check my glory—I, now, in Europe's eye shall stand arrayed in all the honours which success commands— those, who if accident had thwarted my reason-founded schemes would with important ignorance have scoffed at the silly vague projector—will now, with panegyric full as thoughtless, admire my courage, and applaud my prescience—yet, when I have attained the summit of my wishes, when I shou'd give some little rest to my care-worn mind, which long has struggled with adversity; when I might contemplate with joy, the virtues I have found in this new world, virtues more rare than all the riches it abounds in, —I sind I have conducted to this hapless spot, hearts black with discontent, and factious jealousy, thirsting for plunder and for blood! But if determined rigour—virtuous example—</p>

<sp>

<p>May it please your Excellency—I beg your excuse;—but I am so choaked with rage, and breathless with running, that I have scarce power to tell you—your troops have mutinied.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>Mutinied! Explain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Roldan, Sir, that—but I know a soldier's duty too well, to speak ill of a superior officer, or I'd tell your Excellency what a cursed inhuman scoundrel I think him—Their villainy and ingratitude is beyond belief—they murmur that you won't give them leave to cut the throats of these innocent Indians—They call for Roldan to head them, and I'll do him the justice to say, he would let them indulge in such pretty, harmless diversion, as long as there was a throat left in the country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>This demands my instant presence— Herbert, in half an hour, attend me at the camp.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Oh, if I had that Roldan in England, I'd hang him up without judge or jury—tho', on recollection, I have fixed on the worst place in the world for hanging folks up, because a great man like me wills it—but now for vengeance— and yet I don't know how it happens, that altho' in some things I am a tolerably active, industrious fellow, yet when I have to seek revenge, I grow so infernally lazy I can scarce find in my heart to set about it.</p>

<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>May I trust that look propitious—Oh, let thy words confirm it—how hast thou prospered with the soldiers?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Valverdo.</speaker>
<p>They more than met my wishes, and the dastard few, whom conscience kept in doubt, I soon won over by the stimulus of plunder, spiced with our Church's dispensation—in a word, they have all sworn, that on a signal given, they will desert Columbus.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>And in an hour, to a fairer promiser, wou'd they abandon <hi>me.</hi>—It mads me that I must climb the heights of proud ambition on the shoulders of such a crew of mongrels.—My design is to send Columbus, loaded with chains and accusation, a prisoner to Spain, and with him, those hen-hearted fools, whose superstitious scruples might prove troublesome.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Valverdo.</speaker>
<p>With deference to your happier policy, do you not risk by this the wrath of Isabella?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>Not a whit. For, unless Valverdo, thou hast made some saint thy enemy, who, in mere spite, may work for them a miracle, they'll not fatigue the royal ear with much complaining. —To be plain, the vessel which shall convey them hence, is so strained, crazy, and unfit for service, she cannot weather out the slightest storm, therefore, the first rude wind that blows, will send them to explore <hi>another</hi> world.—But hark, that trumpet speaks Columbus.—Now, fortune, be my friend.</p>

<stage><pb n="19" facs="25"/><hi>Enter</hi> Columbus, Moscoso, <hi>and Troops.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>Roldan, what means this outrage, this treason to thy King? Why spur on to desperation and rebellion, your few mistaken followers, whom my power, did I not abhor revenge, could in an instant sweep from the earth?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>Columbus, on <hi>thee</hi> let me retort the name of traitor.—I stand here, chosen by the general voice, the avenger of their wrongs.— 'Tis thee they charge with treason to their King, assert thou wink'st at heresy, and hast made them the slaves of savages.—How dost thou answer?</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Herbert.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>Answer to thee?—Roldan, press not my patience farther.—But to convince thee, traitor, how false are thy aspersions, and that I reign sovereign in my people's love—mark me, be this the test. <stage><hi>[Takes a spear from one of the soldiers, and throws it between him and</hi> Roldan, <hi>dividing the stage.]</hi></stage> Let all, who do not in their hearts believe I mean them fairly, and judge thee worthier to command them, pass that javelin without fear or doubt.—Be that the barrier betwixt my influence and thine.</p>
</sp>

<p>Much it glads me thou hast proffered so fair a trial; and I swear, if they approve thee, I will resign into thy hand my sword and life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>Now, my brave soldiers, hear my firm intent; I will lead you on to wealth, but not by massacre; I'll make you all, the wonders of the world, rich and beloved.—Then, without controul, decide your fate; but, remember, —you have but one step to make from honor to disgrace.</p>

<p>Now, Columbus, look on that paper; by it thou'lt find thy King distrusted thee <stage>[giving the paper.]</stage> And pray you all remember, I exerted not the high authority of which my sovereign thought me worthy, 'till he was deserted, and despised.</p>

<p>And think'st thou, villain, the subtilest inquisitor, who has out-damn'd his fellows in inventive cruelty, could give a pang like that I feel, in seeing thee possessed of power to make the happy wretched?—Oh my poor Indians, who shall now defend you, when this traitor, fit leader of his band of daemons, like the arch-fiend, new lighted on a world of innocence, shall diffuse his devilish spirit, and extend hell's empire.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>What means this strange appearance?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you—that cannibal, Roldan, was, I believe, a little inclined to be dainty, and, wishing for a choice bit, consigned me over to Valverdo, who stood man-cook on the occasion— he ordered me to be scored like pork, and then to be roasted; and the humane priest remarked, there was not so excellent a receipt for insuring the love of heaven, as taking half a dozen hereticks and broiling them gently over a slow fire— Acknowledge Roldan Viceroy, says he—I'd see you damn'd first, says I—so, watching my opportunity, I gave the priest a Cornish hug, shewed his scullions a specimen of English wrestling, and off I came, trussed for dressing, as you see me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Well, my brave friend, thou then wilt aid our cause?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Do you suppose that I, who had my forefathers chopped to atoms in deciding the preference between a red rose and a white one, will stand idle in the cause of humanity?—No, give me a sword, and if I don't, without benefit of clergy, execute that priest, Valverdo, whom the devil has sent hither as his plenipotentiary, make me commander in chief to all the cowards in Europe.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>MATCHLESS infamy! how could the villain Roldan think so poorly of me? the tender of his friendship was sufficient insult, without the terms on which he offers it. Resign thee to him! purchase by treachery the friendship of a traitor, —and for what? Had he the power to raise me above all the glories ambition ever coveted, should I not, after such a crime, sit pining 'midst my splendour, the victim of accusing conscience, finding a curse in every blessing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>My heart burns with impatience to lead your valiant troops to just revenge—but let vigilance and caution guide us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>My friend, do thou direct us at thy will—<stage>[to the priests]</stage>—prepare the rites, the sacrifice for war, and let the priestess who was last received a servant of the Sun, approach the altar with her sacred present.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>The priests range round the altar—folding-doors open, and priestesses enter and range on each side</hi>— Cora <hi>enters, bearing offerings in a golden basket.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<pb n="27" facs="33"/>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>'Tis she—'tis Cora—support me, heaven—this unexpected sight o'erpowers me.—</p>
<stage>[Aside.]</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cora.</speaker>
<stage>[not seeing <hi>Alonzo,</hi> advances and kneels at the altar.]</stage>
<p>Thou, glorious Sun, accept our humble offerings—receive with favour the righteous homage of our grateful hearts—If thy children e'er have broken the laws of hospitality, if ever they have failed to greet a stranger with a brother's love, they nor deserve, nor dare to hope thy fatherly protection—but if they have not merited the wrongs they suffer, preserve—protect them!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>[Priests and priestesses prostrate themselves;—</hi> Catalpo <hi>takes from the altar an Indian weapon, and gives it to</hi> Cora.]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Catalpo.</speaker>
<p>Priestess, bear to our chief this consecrated weapon, it shall defend the Sun's insulted glory, our sovereign's, and his people's rights.</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Cora <hi>receives the weapon, and in bearing it to</hi> Orozimbo, <hi>sees</hi> Alonzo—<hi>exclaims,</hi> —"Oh, heavens!"—<hi>drops the weapon, and faints—</hi> Alonzo <hi>endeavours to assist her.]</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Catalpo. </speaker>
<stage>[to Alozo.]</stage>
<p>Forbear—the proffered kindness claims our thanks; but thy unhallowed hand wou'd be a profanation to a priestess' sacred person.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>What means this tremor?—What shock so suddenly has struck that lovely frame?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cora.</speaker>
<p>I know not—a momentary weakness—</p>
</sp>
<stage>[Cora <hi>is borne off by the priestesses.</hi></stage>

<head><hi>SCENE II.</hi></head><stage>An Indian Town.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Dolores <hi>and</hi> Bribon.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>I tell you, this new world is crammed with wizzards and astrologers, that whiz about in the night time, raising storms, tempests, and mischief; and can tell the day a man is to die, with as much certainty as—as—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>As you can the death of your own patients.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>And can prolong your life year after year as easily—as you can a law-suit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>But what cursed luck it is to be cooped up here with a parcel of savages, who know as much of litigation, as I do of the war-whoop— here I see gold enough to make me a judge; but I can't get a bit big enough to buy a scrap of parchment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Curse the new world, I say—there is not a man in it wants a physician but myself— If I cou'd but have gone back with Columbus— he must by this time be near Spain, and perhaps old Dorothy's dead.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Nelti.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti </speaker>
<stage>[sighs.]</stage>
<p>Shall I never see my dear Englishman
<pb n="29" facs="35"/>again? He pleases my heart when present, but ah, how he plagues it when absent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>Singular case—always plagued my wife when present, pleased her when absent.— <stage>[addressing Nelti]</stage> Most amiable and wealthy savage, behold a lawyer and a christian, who will give you the fee simple of his heart, and receive in return, all your love, and <stage>aside]</stage> all your money.—Doctor, I wish to join issue here—I'll employ you as counsel, —say something for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>I will—I will— <stage><hi>[apart to</hi> Nelti.]</stage> My dear, beautiful goldfinch, that fellow is a wicked, cheating lawyer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>I see he's doing my business for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Look with an eye of commiseration on one who loves thee.—Oh, how I long to kiss those pouting lips.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>You ugly creature, if you touch me, I'll cry out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores. </speaker>
<stage>[aside.]</stage>
<p>Cry out, ha, ha!—when a woman declares she will cry out, and when I say I will give a man a ducat to save him from starving, I believe we are both apt to be cursedly worse than our words—come, one buss—Oh lud, oh lud! how much in love I am!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>You old propagator of poisons, is this the way you plead my cause? By heaven, my dear, that old assassin has killed more than all the bravoes in Spain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Is a Doctor a bravo?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my dear, with an university education—why, you old idol of grave-diggers, have not you confounded all distinction between a preseription and a death-warrant—had not you a regular
<pb n="30" facs="36"/>annuity from the undertakers—have not you cheated me out of thousands, by making people die so fast, I had not time to make their wills?—here's a pretty fellow to make love to a sweet girl—Why, he's as blind as justice, as unfeeling as a whipping-post, as diseased as a lazaretto, and as old as a chancery suit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you Janus-faced villain—What, traduce my fame?—was not I always a favourite with the women?—when their husbands were ill, did not the dear creatures always send for me? —had not I the honour of receiving a gold medal from the inquisition for keeping a man alive nine days, during the most excruciating torture?— and did not I cure you of a crick in the neck, which you got by standing in the pillory, you one-ear'd rascal?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Yonder I see Herbert, and shou'd he find you here—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>He, I suppose, wou'd make his cane join issue with my head—I abscond.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you cowardly villain! what, run away—egad, I'll be off too.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti. </speaker>
<stage>[alone]</stage>
<p>Now I'm alone, I'll practice such behaviour as, I am told, the women in the other world use, that I may win the heart of my dear Englishman.—First then, I must avoid him— certainly—but that I'll do some other time—then I must abuse him—true, but how!—Oh, were it my task to praise, how prodigal would this heart be in pouring forth its store, which niggard now, will not afford one harsh idea. But I must try— ah, yonder he comes—well, I'm quite indifferent
<pb n="31" facs="37"/>whether I see him or not—I'll not walk in his way, I'm determined.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Retires up the stage.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Herbert.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>It's always my infernal luck to be in a rage—to think that these innocent people, who lived as happily before the Spaniard's came, as the people in a village do before an attorney comes among them—should now have gridirons for beds—and what they think worse—the Spaniards place on their bodies, which were as free as Englishmens—an indelible mark of slavery.— Oh, I hope nobody will contradict me to day—I wish I could see Nelti—her soothing fondness would—</p>
<stage>Nelti passes him [singing.]</stage>
<p>Ah, Nelti, how do you do? <stage>[loud.]</stage>—My love! my love!!</p>
<stage>[louder.]</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Is it you? I declare I did not observe you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>No—what might you be thinking of, my dear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>That superior being, the elegant Alonzo.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>You were? and pray what might induce you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Heigho!</p>
<stage>[sighs.]</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>My sweet girl, I'll tell you what. I have been in a most infernal rage, and I am not sure it is quite abated—so, to prevent mistakes, kiss me, —and, if you please, we'll have no jokes at present; for, tho' I love joking pretty well, I love kissing a devilish deal better.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti. </speaker>
<stage>[apart]</stage>
<p>What a charming effect unkindness
<pb n="32" facs="38"/>has—I'll even give him plenty on't—really, Sir, you must possess a considerable share of vanity, in supposing there is no object worthy my regard but you—don't deceive yourself—you, —whom Dolores says, kicked the women, and were kicked by the men.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>He said that, did he? When I have the honour of meeting him, I'll try whether I have forgot my kicking. But—zounds, did not you tell me you adored me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>But then I had scarcely seen the elegant Alonzo, the sage Dolores,—besides, that was some time ago.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Whew !!! Oh, there must be some mistake—certainly one of the wizards old Dolores talks of must have been busy here—but come, Nelti, have done with folly, and tell me you love me sincerely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>I wish I cou'd—but—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Damn your <hi>buts,</hi> yon imp of mischief, what do you mean?—have you encouraged me one day, to make my mortifications greater the next? have I left the jilts of one world to find the same whirligig tricks in another— don't provoke me, or, by St. George and his dragon, I'll—damnation, that a man can't, with honour, beat any woman but his wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear, I have gone too far—Harry, Harry!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Keep out of my way, or by all the heroes in England I shall never contain myself— don't come near me, talk of me, or think of me— Go to Alonzo, —go to the doctor, or go to the devil; and as long as you are as miserable as I wish you, dam'me if I care where you go—</p>

<p>Our commander Roldan, must not think of sharing in this treasure—damn subordination—are not we Christians superior beings? and have not we a right to murder as many Indians as we think fit?</p>

<p>I won't—I tell you what, Viceroy, my
<pb n="34" facs="40"/>maxim is this, —always to obey my commander to the last drop of my blood, while he lets me have my own way—why, you are not in Spain! by St. Lucifer, I won't part with the gold, so, what signifies opposition, when you know you can't help yourself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Roldan.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Columbus, how fully art thou now revenged— <stage>[aside]</stage>—execrable wretch!—but we are friends—the common safety requires obedience, and only to preserve you all from death, I venture to oppose your wills.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Moscoso.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, I am satisfied—I am of a sweet disposition—I have murdered many a man without bearing him the least ill will.</p>

<p>Doom'd to the cruell'st lot of human misery, hear all the horrors of my fate—when I, with heart which ne'er had felt one sense of passion which it glows with now, gave up my future days to holy solitude, that I by such a sacrifice, might heap more honours on a father's head than e'en his virtues could procure him—I then (Oh, heaven) should love e'er prove my conqueror, consigned myself to death, e'en thee, Alonzo, that rash oath condemned thee too.</p>

<p>What dost thou utter?—Am I—am I the author of such direful ruin—am I the murderer of thy guiltless race?—did not affection check my ireful arm—did not my love command me to exist to share thy doom, whatever fate decree it, no longer wou'd I struggle with the horrors that I feel, but part with life and misery together.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Forgive thee, my angel—name not the word—I like a woman to be a little whimsical in trifles, as long as she has the stamina of affection at bottom—I am for none of your still, quiet, good sort of women, that make a man's life one continued dead calm— no—no—refreshing breezes for me—when one is sure not to be driven by them on the rocks of aversion, they render the voyage of life free from languor and insipidity—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Rest assured every future breath of mine shall speak only affection and esteem—but, my Herbert, to owe my life to thy protecting arm, is such joy, as makes me, spite of its awful horrors, bless last night, which thus restor'd thee to my aching heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>My charming girl! Egad, I thought it was all over with us.</p>

<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Herbert! what uneasy hours have I passed, and what melancholy thoughts have been put into my head—look here—</p>

<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Who gave you this—what do you call it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>One of our necromancers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Necromancers—ha! ha! ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Every body believes in them—they say they can raise storms and thunder—can tell whose lives are joined together—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Lives joined together—a curious doctrine—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>But I'll never trust them again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>No, my dear, trust only to me, and you'll certainly not have to deal with a <hi>conjuror.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Here come those frights, Dolores and Bribon—I shou'd like to plague 'em dearly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>Shou'd you, you rogue.—Egad, what you have told me about necromancers, and the strange opinion of your country, that people's lives are joined together, has given me an idea which will plague them confoundedly, for their credulity in astrology is equal to their professional ignorance.—This way, and I'll explain.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Retire up the stage.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Dolores <hi>and</hi> Bribon, <hi>quarelling.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Why do you keep following me, and chattering your cursed jargon—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>I'll walk where I like, and talk what I like—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>"Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Very true—as nature here asserts her rights, of course monkies have privilege to chatter without fear of correction, but to
<pb n="43" facs="49"/>compare your paltry profession with the noble art of healing?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>Why, to say the truth, Doctors do put people out of their misery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Come, that's better than lawyers, who put them into misery, and leave them there.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>Call in a physician, he kills, or nature cures.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>True; but call in a lawyer, and egad, kill or cure, right or wrong, is equally fatal— <stage><hi>[seeing</hi> Herbert.]</stage>—Zounds! there's Herbert— tush, be quiet—let's listen.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Herbert <hi>and</hi> Nelti <hi>come forward.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>You amaze me! Can it be possible that your necromancers are so very potent?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>True indeed, my love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>This union of lives is very wonderful, and doubtless very true—If old Dolores knew that his life depended on another's fate, how anxious wou'd he be to know whose—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Dolores <hi>and</hi> Bribon <hi>run forward, and interrupt him.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>I am very anxious.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>I'd give half my estate to know it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Lives linked together!—oh! I've heard of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>So have I—it's a wonderful discovery!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>To be sure it is.—Why, it accounts at once for those cursed unprofitable apoplexies, What's that cat-o-nine tails?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="44" facs="50"/>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>These varied coloured braids explain every thing as your books do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>By these knotty hieroglyphics, the necromancers expound the decrees of fate—Observe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Keep off—I would not touch it for the world—the idea makes me paralytic. I hope my partner for life is one of these fine healthy Indians—long life to the worthy creatures —I love them in my heart, and so I ought —are not all mankind a kin to one another?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>So Roldan and his crew seem to think, for they treat the Indians exactly like poor relations.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>I'm exceedingly alarmed—wonder who they could find to couple with a lawyer's soul.— Sweetest of women—if you would condescend to enquire.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Oh, if you would obtain from the necromancer one of these conjuring things, to inform me who is interested in my unhappy lot, I'd pray for you—I'd go to the devil for you— I'd—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>And never again teaze me with love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>Never—never.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>I'll hate you as long as I live.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Then meet me presently—you see yonder cave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>That's the dwelling of the necromancer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>I won't go there—I would not see his devilship for the fame of AEsculapius.</p>

<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>Nor I, to be the Lycurgus of the new world.</p>

<p>Well then, I'll take care you shall not see him—so, follow me, and I'll get you information will set your hearts at ease.</p>

<p>I declare, what she has said, has made me so ill, I can scarce stand—Oh, lord, I am afraid my accomplice is going.</p>

<speaker>Dolores.</speaker>
<p>Come, Bribon, forget and forgive— <stage>[gives him a phial]</stage> and, as you are ill, there's a pretty, tasteless medicine that I'm sure will do you good, my dear friend—Dam'me, but there's a dose for you, however.</p>

<p>And does that old fool think I'd ensure death by taking his cursed potions— ah, Sir, there is no way to deal with doctors.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Herbert.</speaker>
<p>I beg your pardon, give them fees while you are well, and nothing when you are ill, and they are not the mischievous animals you think them.</p>

<p>If the necromancer will but speak the truth—</p>

<stage>Exit.</stage>

<p>Ha! ha! already I've perform'd a miracle—for there go a physician and a lawyer, wishing to sind among men health and sincerity— This partnership of liver is a whimsical kind of doctrine, and yet, absurd as it seems, I feel it not altogether untrue, for were my Nelti to die, I believe, Herbert, thy life wou'd not be worth many days.</p>

<p>Sweetest messenger of fate, tell me the name of him, the chords of whose heart are so twisted with mine, that one crack will dissever both.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nelti.</speaker>
<p>Now attend—I said to the necromancer, Most profound and learned sage, on whose life depends that of old Doctor Dominic Dolores? says he, Has he not a decrepid form—withered face—sunk eyes—pug-nose—paper lips—leather cheeks—straggling teeth—says I, the description suits exactly—He then gave me this, which informs me your life is joined to—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Bribon.</speaker>
<p>I hope some rascal, who will be hang'd in a week.</p>

<p>STILL must I wander near these awful walls, uncertain of my fate.—Though days and weeks pass on, yet nought I gain from lengthened time, but added woe.—Still, still I tremble for her life!

<p>Her absence from the temple was discovered.—She was seen with thee.—She begged

<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Stay, stay I charge thee.</p>
</sp>

<p>I have performed my office; urge not my stay, for I have feelings hard to be suppressed, and which, if not suppressed, might wound thee.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>What can now wound me more?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Solasco.</speaker>
<p>We thought thee perfect, we adored thee with reverence, fit only for the power whose worship thou hast violated.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Forbear old man; cease thy untimely chidings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Solasco.</speaker>
<p>My woes may surely justify my chidings. — I, who behold a race, in which each virtue heaven could give, all honour human power could bestow, has bloomed for ages, blasted with infamy, with infamy by thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>"Forbear, forbear."—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Solasco.</speaker>
<p>I, who am doomed to view the dearest object of my doating fondness, whose goodness oft' has steeped these aged eyes in tears of joy, to see her branded with guilt, devoted to destruction.—Have not I full cause, thus loudly to complain, and to upbraid thee, —I, her hapless father?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Father say'st thou? <stage>[falling on his knees]</stage> Thou, the father of my Cora.— Oh forgive me; yet how can'st thou forgive the murderer of thy child? Strike, strike this weapon in my guilty breast—Oh give me death; it will at once to thee be vengeance, and to me be mercy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="53" facs="59"/>
<speaker>Solasco.</speaker>
<p>I seek not vengeance; vengeance is for weaker woes.—But tell me, how could'st thou heap such anguish on a heart that never injured thee?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Oh father, let me call thee so— wring not my soul thus—I love thy daughter with a flame pure as her virtues; think then what I must feel, and even thou may'st pity me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Solasco.</speaker>
<p>If thou dost truly love my hapless child, e'en in the midst of all my woes, my bosom owns one pang for thee—The torments of my Cora soon must end.—Thine, alas!—but let me not encrease the sorrows I could wish to soothe —Farewell—obey my dying child, and grant her all the joy she now can taste—to know that thou art safe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Think'st thou I am base enough to live the monument of her destruction, and my own disgrace.—No, if <hi>my</hi> life cannot alone appease your violated laws, let me at least partake my Cora's doom, and in a fond embrace expiring, I'll bless the fate, that e'en in death unites us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Solasco.</speaker>
<p>Our law allows no partial mitigation— leave her to meet the doom thou can'st not save her from; and do thou bear life a little longer, to give unhappy Cora, in her dying pangs, one ray of comfort.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Oh my father!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>Alonzo, thy aid is now our chief reliance—Roldan prepares to attack us; and since the good Columbus left our coast, thro' many tedious months of care and danger, thy counsel and thy valour, still have been defence and safety to us. But, why droops the brave Alonzo?— If any tender scruple of shedding native blood now check thy wonted ardour, freely avow the generous weakness, —On thee depends our fate— yet would I welcome the loss of empire and of life, rather than save them by Alonzo's misery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>No—With honest zeal I draw my sword against the enemies of innocence, tho' the same clime hath bred us.—He who regards his country's real honour, owns for his countrymen, none but the virtuous.—Yet, Orozimbo, this heart is bursting with its anguish.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>Thy sorrows, tho' I am unconscious of the cause, have found their way into my kindred breast.—Tell me thy griefs, that I may soothe, perhaps relieve them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Thou, thou alone hast power to do it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>Then, by my kingdom, thou shalt find relief.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>

<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<stage>[Points to the Temple]</stage>
<p>Behold those walls! does thy exalted mind, which owns the noblest energies of reason, does it approve that structure, reared by mistaken zeal, to glorify the Deity, by the dire sacrifice of all his dearest blessings?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="55" facs="61"/>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>Say on.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>Does she, who, in the prime of youth, when every fine affection of the soul glows with its noblest fervour, when all the joys of life seem decked with magic splendour, does she deserve the punishment of guilt, who, buried in yon' ruthless prison, casts a fond thought on the delights she has lost, dares to condemn the tyranny which binds her, and claims her right to liberty and love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>I would aspire to reign beyond the limits of weak prejudice; but reflect, Alonzo, how sacred are a country's customs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>There, there's the source of half the misery of human kind—custom is the vile confounder of virtue and of vice.—It checks the operation of our godlike reason, and makes the greatest glory of creation, a being void of will— Oh, Orozimbo, soar superior to the mists of error —when thy great soul displays unmanacled its glorious attributes—thou'lt cease to think that God delights in cruelty, whose blest infusion in the human heart breathes mercy and benevolence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orozimbo.</speaker>
<p>Oft have I admired thy wisdom and thy virtue; but, now methinks, in thee I hear the voice of heaven, and it shall be obeyed.— But I must praise thy wonderous goodness, which can thus plead for other's misery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alonzo.</speaker>
<p>There I am unworthy of thy praise— mine is a selfish zeal—I've sued for one whom I adore; nay for myself I've sued.—Oh, Orozimbo, in the repeal of an inhuman law, thou hast restored my forfeit life—nay more—the life of her I love.</p>

<p>One moment stay.—Lest the fell chance of war (which, heaven avert) shou'd leave my lovely Cora without the generous friend she has found in thee; first let me bear your royal mandate to the temple, strictly commanding, (whatever fate may in the battle wait us) pardon and liberty for her.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Catalpo.</speaker>
<p>Tho' I receiv'd, with all apparent reverence, the mandate of the King, to spare the impious priestess, I but dissembled, to preserve our sacred rites inviolate—had I opposed the hated order, his power would have rescued from our grasp, the object of our vengeance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Priest.</speaker>
<p>But, say, Catalpo, does no doubt remain of this young priestess' crime! For, by our chief's command to spare her life, he surely deems her innocent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>"Catalpo.</speaker>
<p>There can exist no doubt—On the morn which followed that dreadful night, when the dire war of elements diffused such general horror, Blessco, whose truth none yet e'er doubted, beheld her conducted to the temple by one of these hated strangers, with whom she parted
<pb n="59" facs="65"/>with every mark of fond endearment—Long he concealed this, till at length his conscience sorely wounded by the guilt he secreted, he on his oath declared to me this profanation. Instant conduct the offender to her doom.</p>

<stage><hi>Enter priests, conducting</hi> Cora <hi>in procession, with archers and</hi> Solasco.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Solasco. </speaker>
<stage>[falling on his knees.]</stage>
<p>Oh, reverend priest, on my devoted head let fall the vengeance of the offended law—the crime was mine; I heeded not the tears which trickled down my Cora's angel-face; I listened not to the reproving sighs, which forced their way from her lamenting bosom; but, deaf to nature's voice, compelled her to dedicate her youth to solitude and misery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Catalpo.</speaker>
<p>Hence, nor offer further insult to offended heaven, by pleading for a wretch who braves its laws.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Solasco.</speaker>
<p>Sure heaven will pardon a poor old man, who pleads for mercy to his child—the offence was mine, then take my forfeit life, but save, O save my Cora.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Catalpo.</speaker>
<p>Retire; for tho' no pray'rs shall urge me to neglect the duty which I owe to heaven, I do not wish a father's eyes to view the shedding of his daughter's blood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Solasco.</speaker>
<p>And does thy piety, thy filial love, then doom thee to destruction? Cursed Solasco! how worthless art thou of thy child—thy injustice devoted her to misery, and in return she dooms herself to death, to save her cruel father's life.</p>

<p>The arm of heaven was surely stretched to save me—I forced my way thro' the opposing multitude, and seeing all was lost, I came once more to view this precious treasure, and die defending it—here I met death in all his direst horror, cloathed in the garb of priestly cruelty, not even thy command—their king's decree, could stop the torrent of their barbarous zeal.</p>

<speaker>Columbus.</speaker>
<p>Alonzo, my wrongs were enviable— captivity was triumph — When amidst the applauding shouts of thousands, I approached the royal presence, the suffering monarch shrunk from the fight, and threw his mantle o'er his face, crimsoned with shame; then raised me to his arms, still my pride sustained me; but when I beheld the beauteous Isabella, try to force from their dire grasp my galling chains, and on each wound drop a balmy tear, loyalty and love ruthed on my soul, I embraced her royal feet, and gave her tears for thanks; then all the pride of pageantry was decreed, but my soul languished for

Oh, were I satisfied no future Roldans would alarm your peace, I should be blest indeed.—Had I earlier known that Englands monarch would have graced my fortunes with his victorious banner, then would your freedom been firmly sixed.—They only, who themselves are free, give liberty to others.</p>

<l>To your support alone he trusts his cause,</l>

<l>"You'll prove my torment—you've proved mine already.</l>
<l>"To guard my rights, my Lord, I must endeavour—</l>
<l>"You're always out—and you are out for ever—</l>
<l>"Then both I trust are happy, <hi>sposo caro</hi>— <stage>with ironical tenderness)</stage></l>
<l>"You throw at <hi>hazard,</hi> and I punt at <hi>pharo;</hi></l>
<l>"Each have their object—so resentment smother—</l>
<l>"Hold out the olive <hi>branch,</hi> or wear another."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Suffice this raillery—enough to prove,</l>
<l>Our noblest conquest, is our own self-love;</l>
<l>The Author, who to night has greatly dar'd,</l>
<l>To brave the issue of your high award;</l>
<l>Tho' old, the legend whence his scenes he drew,</l>
<l>Humbly presumes, the inserence may be new;</l>
<l>Should then the efforts of his untaught muse,</l>
<l>By just, tho' small desert, his flights excuse;</l>
<l>Let him enjoy, for all his anxious toils,</l>
<l>That bright reward—the triumph of your smiles.</l>
