<head>To the Right Honourable ARTHUR Lord <hi>ALTHAM,</hi> BARON of <hi>ALTHAM,</hi> In the Kingdom of IRELAND.</head>
<opener><salute>My LORD,</salute></opener>
<p><hi>POetry,</hi> in its first Institution, was principally design'd to Correct, and rectify Manners. Thence it was that the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Athenian Stages</hi> were accounted Schools of Divinity and Morality; where the Tragick Writers of those Days inspired their Audiences with <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Heroick Sentiments,</hi> and the <hi>Comick</hi> laugh'd and diverted them out of their <hi>Vices;</hi> and by rediculing <hi>Folly, Intemperence,</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi>
<pb facs="4"/>
gave them an Indignation for those Irregularities, and made them pursue the opposite <hi>Virtues.</hi></p>
<p>This caus'd the <hi>Dramatic Poets,</hi> in ancient Times, not only to be reverenc'd by the lower sort of People, but highly Esteem'd and Courted by Persons of the first Rank; and tho' the Writers of latter Ages, have, in a greater Measure, not to say in a scandelous Manner, deviated from the Foot-steps, and Examples of their Predecessors; yet have they found Protection and Favour with those, who have been so Generous as to ascribe the Faults of the <hi>Poets</hi> to the Degeneracy of the <hi>Age</hi> wherein they liv'd.</p>
<p>This consideration, <hi>my Lord,</hi> has imbolden'd me to this Address, for tho' on the one Hand I am sensible, that the following Piece does little Merit your <hi>Lordship</hi>'s Patronage; yet your innate Goodness and Generosity give me hopes, that your Lordship will Pardon this Intrusion, in
<pb facs="5"/>
which I have the Examples of all those that <hi>wrote</hi> before me to bear me out. I heartily wish this Play were more worthy of your <hi>Lordship</hi>'s Acceptance: Yet so much, I hope, will be forgiven to the fondness of a Mother for her Production; if, I say, in its Favour, that through the whole Piece, I have had a tender regard to good Manners, and by the main Drift of it, endeavour'd to Redicule and Correct one of the most reigning Vices of the Age. I might say, as many of my <hi>Brethren</hi> have done upon slighter Grounds, that this Play has had the good Fortune to Please and Divert the Nicest, and Politest Part of the Town; but I should set little Stress on their Applause, had I not some reason to depend upon your <hi>Lordship</hi>'s Approbation, whose Judgement, Penetration and Discernment, are alone sufficient to do full Justice to a performance of this Kind.</p>
<p><pb facs="6"/>
And now, my <hi>Lord,</hi> if I follow'd the beaten Road of Dedicators, it would naturally Engage me in a <hi>Panegirick,</hi> upon your Lordship's Personal Virtues, and those of your <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Pious Family;</hi> but I shall purposely decline a Talk to which I freely own my Ability is Unequal, and which, tho' manag'd by a <hi>Masterly Pen,</hi> would make your Modesty suffer. Therefore I shall conclude, with begging your <hi>Lordship</hi>'s leave to Subscribe my self, with all imaginable Respect and Sincerity.</p>
<closer><salute>My LORD,</salute>
<signed>Your Lordship's most Obedient, and most Devoted Humble Servant,</signed></closer>

<head>PROLOGUE</head>
<stage>Spoke by Mr. <hi>Penkethman.</hi></stage>
<l>IN all the Faces that to Plays Resort,</l>
<l>Whether of Country, City, Mob or Court;</l>
<l>I've always found that none such hopes Inspire,</l>
<l>As you—dear Brethren of the Upper Tire.</l>
<l>Poets in Prologues, may both Preach and Rail,</l>
<l>Yet all their Wisdom, nothing will avail,</l>
<l>Who writes not up to you, 'tis ten to one will fail.</l>
<l>Your thundring plaudit 'tis that deals out Fame,</l>
<l>You make Plays run, tho' of themselves but Lame:</l>
<l>How often have we known your Noise Commanding,</l>
<l>Impose on your Inferior Masters Understanding;</l>
<l>Therefore, Dear Brethren, (since I am one of you)</l>
<l>Whether adorn'd in Grey, Green, Brown or Blue,</l>
<l>This day stand all by me, as I will fall by you,</l>
<l>And now to let—</l>
<l>The poor Pit see how Pinky's Voice Commands,</l>
<l>Silence—Now rattle all your Sticks, and clap your grimy Hands▪</l>
<l>I greet your Love—and let the vainest Author show,</l>
<l>Half this Command on clearer Hands below,</l>
<l>Nay, more to prove your Interest, let this Play live by you.</l>
<l>So may you share good Claret with your Masters,</l>
<l>Still free in your Amours from their Disasters;</l>
<l>Free from poor House-keeping, where Peck is under Locks▪</l>
<l>Free from Cold Kitchings, and no Christmas Box:</l>
<l>So may no long Debates i'th' House of Commons,</l>
<l>Make you in the Lobby Starve, when hungar Summons:</l>
<l>But may your plentious Vails come flowing in,</l>
<l>Give you a lucky hit, and make you Gentlemen;</l>
<l>And thus preferr'd, ne'er fear the World's Reproaches,</l>
<l>But shake your Elbows with my Lord, and keep your Coaches:</l>

<head>EPILOGUE</head>
<stage>Spoke by Mr. <hi>Esthcourt.</hi></stage>
<l>THis goodly Fabrick to a gazing Tarr,</l>
<l>Seems Fore and Aft, a Three Deckt-man os War.</l>
<l>Abaft, the Hold's the Pit, from thence look up,</l>
<l>Aloft! that Swabber's Nest, that's the Main-Top.</l>
<l>Side-boxes mann'd with Beau, and modish Rake,</l>
<l>Are like the Fore-castle, and Quarter-Deck.</l>
<l>Those dark disguised, advent'rous, black-nos'd few,</l>
<l>May pass for Gunners, or a Fire-ship's Crew.</l>
<l>Some come like Privateers a Prize to seize,</l>
<l>And catch the <hi>French</hi> within the Narrow Seas.</l>
<l>The Orange-Ladies, Virgins of Renown,</l>
<l>Are Powder-Monkies running up and down.</l>
<l>We've here our Calms, our Storms, and prosp'rous Gales,</l>
<l>And shift our Scenes as Seamen shift their Sails.</l>
<l>The Ship's well mann'd, and not ill Woman'd neither,</l>
<l>So Ballast'd and Stow'd, my Lads, she'll bear the Weather.</l>
<l>But greater Dangers ventring Players alarm,</l>
<l>This Night's Engagement's worse than any Storm.</l>
<l>The Poet's Captain, but half dead with fright,</l>
<l>She leaves her Officers to maintain the Fight;</l>
<l>Yon'd middle Teer with Eighteen Pounders mauls us,</l>
<l>That Upper-Deck with Great and Small-Shot gauls us.</l>
<l>But from this Lower-Teer most Harm befals,</l>
<l>There's no opposing their prevailing Balls.</l>
<l>As either Foe or Friend their Chain-shot flies,</l>
<l>We sink or swim, we Conquer, Fall or Rise.</l>
<l>To fit and rig our Ships much Pains we take;</l>
<l>Grant we may now a Saving-Voyage make.</l>
<l>Here we're Embark'd, and as you Smile or Frown,</l>
<l>You are our Stars, by You we Live or Drown.</l>

<p>How long have you liv'd with your Lady?</p>

<p>A Month, too long by thirty Days, if this be her way of living; I shall be dead before the Year's out; she Games all Night, and Sleeps all Day.</p>

<p>As long as you sleep, what's Matter?</p>

<p>She has generally ill luck, yet her Inclination for Play is as strong as ever.—Did your Ladyship win, or lose, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>

<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>What does your Ladiship think of a Walk in the Park?—The Park is pleasant in a Morning, the Air is so very sweet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I don't think so; the sweetness of the Park is at Eleven, when the Beau <hi>Monde</hi> makes their Tower there, 'tis an unpolish'd Curiosity to walk when only Birds can see one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Bless me, Madam! Your Uncle—now for a Sermon of two Hours.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Sir <hi>Richard Plainman,</hi> in a Night-Gown as from Bed.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
<p>So Niece! I find you're resolv'd to keep on your course of Life; I must be wak'd at Four with Coach, Coach, Chair, Chair; give over for shame, and Marry, Marry, Niece.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Now would I forfeit the Heart of my next Admirer, to know the cause of this Reproach. Pray, Uncle, explain'd your self; for I protest I can't guess what Crime I have unhappily committed to merit this advice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
<p>How can you look me in the Face, and ask me that Question? Can you that keep a Basset-Table, a publick Gaming-House, be insensible of the shame on't? I have often told you how much the vast concurse of People, which Day and Night make my House their Rendevouze, incommode my Health; your Apartment is a Parade for Men of all Ranks, from the Duke to the Fidler, and your Vanity thinks they all pay Devoir to your Beauty—but you mistake, every one has his several end in Meeting here, from the Lord to the Sharper, and each their seperate Interest to Admire—some Fools there may be, for there's seldom a crowd without.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Malice—some Fools? I can't bear it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Nay, 'tis very affronting, truly Madam.</p>

<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Ay, is it not <hi>Alpiew?—</hi>Yet, now I think on't, 'tis the defect of Age to rail at the Pleasure's of Youth, therefore I shall not disorder my Face with a frown about it. Ha, ha, I hope, Uncle, you'l take peculiar care of my Cousin <hi>Valeria,</hi> in disposing of her according to the Breeding you have given her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
<p>The Breeding I have given her! I would not have her have your Breeding, Mistress, for all the Wealth of <hi>England</hi>'s Bank; no, I bread my Girl in the Country, a stranger to the Vices of this Town, and am resolv'd to Marry her to a Man of Honour, Probity and Courage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>What the Sea Captain, Uncle? Faugh, I hate the smell of Pitch and Tarr; one that can Entertain one with nothing but Fire and Smoak, Larboard and Starboard, and t'other Bowl of Punch, ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>And for every fault that she commits he'll condemn her to the Bilboes, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I fancy my Cousin's Philosophy, and the Captain's Couragious Bluster, will make Angelick Harmony.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Madam, sweeter Harmony than your <hi>Sept &amp; Leva</hi> Fops, Rakes and Gamesters; give me the Man that serves my Country, that preserves both my Estate and Life—Oh, the glorious Name of Soldier; if I were Young, I'd go my self in Person, but as it is—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>You'll send your Daughter—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Minx, and a good Dowry with her, as a reward for Virtue like the Captains.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>But suppose, Sir, Mrs. <hi>Valeria</hi> should not like him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
<p>I'll suppose no such thing, Mistress, she shall like him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Why, there tis now, indeed, Uncle, your're too positive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
<p>And you to Impertinent: Therefore I resolve to quit your House; you shan't keep your Revels under the Roof where I am.</p>

<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>I'd have you to know, Sir, my Lady keeps no Revels beneath her Quality.</p>

<p>Hold your Tongue, Mrs. <hi>Pert,</hi> or I shall display your Quality in its proper Colours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>I don't care, say your worst of me, and spare not; but for my Lady—my Lady's a Widdow, and Widdows are accountable to none for their Actions—Well, I shall have a Husband one of those days, and be a Widow too, I hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
<p>Not unlikely, for the Man will hang himself the next day, I warrant him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>And if any, Uncle, pretends to controul my Actions—</p>

<sp>

<p>He'd loose his labour, I'm certain—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>I'd treat him—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
<p>Don't provoke me, Houswife, don't.</p>

<speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>Lookee, Unkle, do what you can, I'm resolv'd to follow my own Inclinations.</p>

<p>Which infallibly carries you to Noise, Nonsence, Foppery and Ruin; but no matter, you shall out of my Doors, I'll promise you, my House shall no longer bear the Scandalous Name of a <hi>Basset Table:</hi> Husbands shall no more have cause to date their Ruin from my Door, nor cry there, there my Wife Gam'd my Estate away—Nor Children Curse my Posterity, for their Parents knowing my House.</p>

<p>For my good! Oh, mon cour? Now cannot I Divine what 'tis, that I do more than the rest of the World, to deserve this blame.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Nor I, for the Soul of me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Shou'd all the rest of the World follow your Ladyship's Example, the order of Nature would be inverted, and every good, design'd by Heaven, become a Curse, Health and Plenty no longer would be known among us.—You cross the purpose of the Day and Night, you Wake when you should Sleep, and make all who have any dependence on you, Wake while you Repose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Bless me, may not any Person Sleep when they please?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Lucy.</speaker>
<p>No, there are certain Hours, that good Manners, Modesty and Health require your Care; for Example disorderly Hours are neither Healthful nor Modest—And 'tis not Civil to make Company wait Dinner for your Dressing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Why, does any body Dine before four a Clock in <hi>London?</hi> For my part I think it an Ill-bred Custom, to make my Appetite Pendulum to the Twelfth hour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Besides, 'tis out of Fashion to Dine by Day light, and so I told Sir <hi>Richard</hi> yesterday, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Lucy.</speaker>
<p>No doubt, but you did, Mrs. <hi>Alpiew;</hi> and then you entertain such a Train of People, Cousin, that my Lady <hi>Reveller</hi> is as noted as a publick Ordinary, where every Fool with Money finds a Welcome.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Would you have me shut my doors against my Friends—Now she is jealous of Sir <hi>James Courtly.</hi> <stage>(aside.)</stage> Besides, is it possible to pass the Evenings without Diversions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>No certainly—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Lucy.</speaker>
<p>I think the Play-house, the much more innocent and commendable Diversion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>To be seen there every Night, in my Opinion, is more destructive to the Reputation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Well, I had rather be noted every Night in the front Box, then, by my absence, once be suspected of Gaming; one ruins my Estate and Character, the other diverts my Temper, and improves my Mind. Then you have such a number of Lovers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Oh <hi>Cupid,</hi> is it a Crime to have a number of Lovers? If it be, 'tis the pleasantest Crime in the World. A Crime that falls not every day, to every Womans Lot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Lucy.</speaker>
<p>I dare be positive every Woman does not wish it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Because wishes have no Effect, Cousin, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Methinks my Lord <hi>Worthy</hi>'s Assiduity might have banish'd the admiring Croud by this time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Banish'd 'em? Oh, Mon cour! what pleasure is there in one Lover; 'tis like being seen always in one Suit of Cloaths; a Woman, with one Admirer, will ne'er be a Reigning Toast.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="17"/>
<speaker>L. Lucy.</speaker>
<p>I am sure those that Encourage more, will never have the Character of a Reigning Virtue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I slight the malicious Censure of the Town, yet defy it to asperse my Verture; Nature has given me a Face, a Shape, a Mein, an Air for Dress, and Wit and Humour to subdue. And shall I lose my Conquest for a Name.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Nay, and among the unfashionable sort of People too, Madam; for Persons of Breeding and Quality will allow, that Gallantry and Virtue are not inseperable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Lucy.</speaker>
<p>But Coquetry and Reputation are, and there is no differerence in the Eye of the World, between having really committed the Fault, and lying under the Scandal; for, my own part, I would take as much Care to preserve my Fame, as you would your Virtue.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>A little pains will serve you for that, Cousin; for I never once heard you nam'd—A Mortification would break my Heart, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>L. Lucy.</speaker>
<p>'Tis better never to be nam'd, than to be ill spoke of; but your Reflections shall not Disorder my Temper. I could wish, indeed, to convince you of your Error, because you share my Blood; but since I see the Vanity of the attempt, I shall desist.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady,</speaker>
<p>I humbly thank your Ladiship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Madam, here's my Lord <hi>Worthy,</hi> Sir <hi>James Courtly,</hi> and Ensign <hi>Lovely,</hi> coming down; will your Ladyship see them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Now have I a strong Inclination to Engage Sir <hi>James,</hi> to discompose her Gravity; for if I have any Skill in Glances, she loves him—but then my Lord <hi>Worthy</hi> is so peevish since our late Quarrel, that I'm afraid to Engage the Knight in a Ducl; besides, my Absence, I know, will teize him more, therefore, upon Consideration, I'le retire. Cousin <hi>Lucy;</hi> Good Morrow. I'le leave you to better Company, there's a Person at hand may prevent your Six-a-Clock Prayers.</p>

<p>Ha! Sir <hi>James Courtly—</hi>I must own I think him agreeable—but am sorry she believes I do. I'le not be seen; for if what I scarce know my self be grown so visible to her, perhaps, he too may Discover it, and then I am lost.</p>

<p>Ha! was not that Lady <hi>Lucy?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ensign.</speaker>
<p>It was—ah, Sir <hi>James,</hi> I find your Heart is out of Order about that Lady, and my Lord <hi>Worthy</hi> languishes for Lady <hi>Reveller.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir James.</speaker>
<p>And thou art sick for <hi>Valeria,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Daughter. A poor distresled Company of us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ensign,</speaker>
<p>'Tis true, that little she-Philosopher has made me do Pennance more heartily than ever my sins did; I deserve her by meer Dint of Patience. I have stood whole hours to hear her Assert that Fire cannot Burn, nor Water Drown, nor Pain Afflict, and forty ridiculous Systems—and all her Experiments on Frogs, Fish—and Flies, ha, ha, ha, without the lcast Contradiction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ensign.</speaker>
<p>Contradiction, no, no, I allow'd all she said with undoubtedly, Madam,—I am of your mind, Madam, it must be so—natural Causes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir James.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, I think it is a supernatural cause which Enables thee to go thro' this Fatigue, if it were not to raise thy Fortune, I should think thee Mad to pursue her; but go on and prosper, nothing in my Power shall be wanting to assist you—My Lord <hi>Worthy—</hi>your Lordship is as Melancholy as a losing Gamester.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord.</speaker>
<p>Faith, Gentlemen, I'm out of Humour, but I don't know at what.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="19"/>
<speaker>Sir James.</speaker>
<p>Why then I can tell you, for the very same reason that made your Lordship stay here to be Spectator of the very Diversion you hate—Gaming—the same Cause makes you uneasy in all Company, my Lady <hi>Reveller.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord.</speaker>
<p>Thou hast hit it, <hi>James,</hi> I confess I love her Person, but hate her Humours, and her way of Living; I have some reasons to believe I'm not indifferent to her, yet I despair of fixing her, her Vanity has got so much the Mistress of her Resolution; and yet her Passion for Gain furmounts her Pride, and lays her Reputation open to the World. Every Fool that has ready Money, shall dare to boast himself her very humble Servant; 'ds Death, when I could cut the Rascal's Throat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir James.</speaker>
<p>your Lordship is even with her one Way, for you are as testy as she's vain, and as fond of an opportunity to Quarrel with her, as she of a Gaming Acquaintance; my Opinion is, my Lord, she'll ne're be won your Way.</p>
<l>To gain all Women there's a certain Rule,</l>
<l>If Wit should sail to please, then Act the Fool;</l>
<l>And where you find simplicity not take,</l>
<l>Throw off Disguises—and Profess the Rake;</l>
<l>Observe which Way their chiefest Humours run,</l>
<l>They're by their own lov'd, can't the surest Way undone.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord.</speaker>
<p>Thou'rt of a happy temper, Sir <hi>James,</hi> I wish I could be so too; but since I can't add to your Diversion, I'll take my leave, good Morrow, Gentlemen.</p>
<stage>(Exit.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir James.</speaker>
<p>This it is to have more Love than Reason about one; you and I <hi>Lovely</hi> will go on with Discretion, and yet I fear it's in Lady <hi>Lucy</hi>'s Power to banish it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ensign.</speaker>
<p>I find Mrs. <hi>Sago,</hi> the Drugsters Wife's Interest, begins to shake, Sir <hi>James.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir James.</speaker>
<p>And I fear her Love for Play begins to shake her Husband's Baggs too—faith, I am weary of that Intreague, lest I should be suspected to have a hand in his Ruin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="20"/>
<speaker>Ensign.</speaker>
<p>She did not lose much to Night, I believe; preethy, Sir <hi>James,</hi> what kind of a temper'd Woman is she? Has she Wit?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir James.</speaker>
<p>That she has—A large Portion, and as much Cunning, or she could never have manag'd the old Fellow so nicely; she has a vast Passion for my Lady <hi>Reveller,</hi> and endeavours to mimick her in every thing—Not a sute of Cloaths, or a Top-knot, that is not exactly the same with hers—then her Plots and Contrivances to supply these Expences, puts her continually upon the Rack; yet to give her her due, she has a fertile Brain that Way; but come, shall we go home and sleep two or three Hours, at Dinner I'll introduce you to Capt. <hi>Hearty,</hi> the Sea Officer, your Rival that is to be, he's just come to Town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ensign.</speaker>
<p>A powerful Rival, I fear, for Sir <hi>Richard</hi> resolves to Marry him to his Daughter; all my hopes lyes in her Arguments, and you know Philosophers are very positive—and if this Captain does but happen to Contradict one Whimsical Notion, the Poles will as soon join, as they Couple, and rather then yield, she would go to the Indies in search of <hi>Dampier</hi>'s Ants.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir James.</speaker>
<p>Nay, she is no Woman if she Obeys.</p>
<l>Women like Tides with Passions Ebb and Flow,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Buckle.</speaker>
<p>Good Morrow.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Good Morrow, good Morrow, is that all your business here; What means that Affected Look, as if you long'd to be examin'd what's the Matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buc.</speaker>
<p>The Capricio's of Love, <hi>Madamoselle;</hi> the Capricio's of Love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Why—are you in Love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buc.</speaker>
<p>I—in Love! No, the Divel take me if ever I shall be infected with that Madness, 'tis enough for one in a Family to Fall under the whimsical Circumstances of that Distemper. My Lord has a sufficient Portion for both; here—here—here's a Letter for your Lady, I believe the Contents are not so full of Stars and Darts, and Flames, as they us'd to be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>My Lady will not concern her self with your Lord, nor his Letters neither, I can assure you that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buc.</speaker>
<p>So much the better, I'le tell him what you say—Have you no more?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Tell him it is not my fault, I have done as much for his Service, as lay in my Power, till I put her in so great a Passion, 'tis impossible to Appease her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="22"/>
<speaker>Buckle.</speaker>
<p>Very good—my Lord is upon the Square, I promise ye, as much inraged as her Ladiship to the full. Well, Mrs. <hi>Alpiew,</hi> to the longest Day of his Life he fwears, never to forget Yesterday's Adventure, that's given him perfect, perfect Liberty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>I believe so—What was it, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buckle.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you; 'twas a matter of Consequence, I assure you, I've known Lovers part for a less Triffle by half.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>No Disgressions, but to the point, what was it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buckle.</speaker>
<p>This—my Lord, was at the Fair with your Lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>What of that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buckle.</speaker>
<p>In a Raffling-shop she saw a young Gentleman, which she said was very handsom—At the same time, my Lord, prais'd a young Lady; she redoubles her Commendations of the Beau—He enlarges on the Beauty of the Bell; their Discourse grew warm on the subject; they Pause; she begins again with the Perfections of the Gentleman; he ends with the same of the Lady; Thus they persu'd their Arguments, still finding such mighty Charms in their new Favourites, till they found one another so Ugly—so Ugly—that they parted with full Resolutions never to meet again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, pleasant; well, if you have no more to tell me, adieu.</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buckle.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my Lord—what, she'd not receive it then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buckle.</speaker>
<p>No, my Lord.</p>

<p>How durst you stay so long.</p>

<p>I beg your Lordship not to harbour an ill Opinion of me, I opposed her anger with my utmost Skill, prais'd all your Actions, all your Parts, but all in Vain.</p>

<p>Enough, Enough, Madam, she has taken the best method in the World—Well, then we are ne'er to meet again?</p>

<sp>

<p>I know not that, my Lord—</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Buckle.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage> Yes, so 'twas a sign by the pleasure you discover'd, in thinking she had writ to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord.</speaker>
<p>I suppose, she has entertain'd you with the Cause of this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>No, my Lord, never mention'd a Syllable, only said, she had for ever done with you; and charg'd me, as I valued her favour, to receive no Message nor Letter, from you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord.</speaker>
<p>May I become the very'st Wretch alive, and all the Ills immaginable fall upon my Head, if I speak to her more; nay, ever think of her but with Scorn—Where is she now?</p>

<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>I believe, my Lord, trying on a Mantua; I left her with Mrs. <hi>Pleatwell,</hi> and that us'd to hold her a great while, for the Woman is saucily Familiar with all the Quality, and tells her all the Scandal.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord.</speaker>
<p>And conveys Letters upon occasion; 'tis tack'd to their Profession—But, my Lady <hi>Reveller</hi> may do what she pleases, I am no more her Slave, upon my Word; I have broke my Chain—She has not been out then since she Rose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>No, my Lord.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if she has, or has not, 'tis the same thing to me; she may go the end of the World, if she will; I shan't take any pains to follow her—Whose Footman was that I met?</p>

<p>Ah! Madam, if you had seen him, you must have had Compassion; I would not have such a Heart of Adamant for the World; poor Lord, sure you have the strangest Power over him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Silly—one often Fanices one has Power, when one has none at all; I'll tell the <hi>Alpiew,</hi> he vex'd me strangely before this grand Quarrel; I was at <hi>Picquet</hi> with my Lady <hi>Love-Witt</hi> four Nights ago, and bid him read me a new Copy of Verses, because, you know, he never Plays, and I did not well know what to do with him; he had scarce begun, when I being eager at a Pique, he rose up, and said, he believ'd I lov'd the Musick of my own Voice, crying Nine and Twenty, Threescore, better than the sweetest Poetry in the Universe, and abruptly left us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>A great Crime, indeed, not to read when People are at a Game they are oblig'd to talk to all the while.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Crime, yes, indeed was it, for my Lady loves Poetry better than Play, and perhaps before the Poem had been done had lost her Money to me. But, I wonder, <hi>Alpiew,</hi> by what Art 'tis you engage me in this Discourse, why
<pb n="18" facs="27"/>
shou'd I talk of a Man that's utterly my Aversiou—Have you heard from Mrs. <hi>Sago</hi> this Morning?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, Madam, she never sails; she has sent your Ladiship the finest Cargo made up of Chocolate, Tea, Montifiasco Wine, and 50 Rarities beside, with something to remember me, good Creature, that she never forgets. Well, indeed, Madam, she is the best natur'd Woman in the World; it grieves me to think what Sums she loses at Play.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Oh fye, she must, a Citizen's Wife is not to be endur'd amongst Quality; had she not Money, 'twere impossible to receive her—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Nay, indeed, I must say that of you Women of Quality, if there is but Money enough, you stand not upon Birth or Reputation, in either Sex; if you did, so many Sharpers of <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and Mistresses of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, would not be daily admitted.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Oh! dear Cousin, don't stop me, I shall lose the finest Infect for Desection, a huge Flesh Fly, which Mr. <hi>Lovely</hi> sent me just now, and opening the Box to try the Experiment away it flew.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>I am glad the poor Fly escap'd; will you never be weary of these Whimsies?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Whimsies! natural Peilosophy a Whimsy! Oh, the unlearn'd World.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Ridiculous Learning?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alp.</speaker>
<p>Ridiculous, indeed, for Women; Philosophy Sutes our Sex, as Jack Boots would do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Custom would bring them as much in Fashion as Furbeloes, and Practice would make us as Valiant as e're a Hero of them all; the Resolution is in the Mind,—Nothing can enslave that.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>In my Conscience, <hi>Alpiew,</hi> this pritty Creature's spoil'd. Well, Cousin, might I Advise, you should bestow your Fortune in Founding a College for the Study of Philosophy, where none but Women should be admitted, and to Immortalize your Name, they should be call'd <hi>Valerians,</hi> ha, ha, ha.</p>

<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Well, but I'le convince you then, I have dissected my Dove—and positively I think the Vulgar Notion true, for I could find none.</p>

<p>Oh, Barbarous; kill'd your pritty Dove! <stage>[Starting.</stage></p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<p>Fy, fy, Sir, believe him not, I have a Passion, an extream Passion, for a Hero—especially if he belongs to the Sea; methinks he has an Air so Fierce, so Piercing, his very Looks commands Respect from his own Sex, and all the Hearts of ours.</p>

<p>Oh! ay, it is so pretty to have one's Husband gone Nine Months of the Twelve, and then to bring one home fine China, fine Lace, fine Muslin, and fine Indian Birds, and a thousand Curiosities.</p>

<p>Madam, here's Mr. <hi>Lovely;</hi> I have introduc'd him as One of my Lady's Visitors, and brought him down the Back-stairs.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>I'm oblig'd to you, he comes opportunely.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lovely.</speaker>
<p>Wonderful! but it Circulates prettier in this Fair Neck.</p>

<speaker>Lovely.</speaker>
<p>Prodigious! 'tis the Joint-Worm, which the Learned talk of so much.</p>

<p>Ay, the <hi>Lumbricus Latus,</hi> or <hi>Foescia,</hi> as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls it, or Vulgarly in <hi>English</hi> the Tape-Worm.<hi>—Thudaeus</hi> tells us of One of these Worms found in a Human Body 200 Foot long, without Head or Tail.</p>

<p>I think the First you show'd me the greatest Curiosity.</p>

<p>'Tis very odd, really, that there should be every Inch a Joint, and every Joint a Mouth.—Oh the profound Secrets of Nature!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lovely.</speaker>
<p>'Tis strangely Surprizing.—But now let me be heard, for mine's the Voice of Nature too; methinks you neglect your self, the most Perfect Piece of all her Works.</p>

<p>Why? What Fault do you find in me?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lovely.</speaker>
<p>You have not Love enough; that Fire would Consume and Banish all Studies but its own; your Eyes wou'd Sparkle, and spread I know not what, of Lively and Touching, o'er the whole Face; this Hand, when Press'd by him you Love, would Tremble to your Heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<p>Why so it does,—have I not told you Twenty Times I Love you,—for I hate Disguise; your Temper being Adapted to mine, gave my Soul the First Impression;—you know my Father's Positive,—but do not believe he shall Force me to any Thing that does not Love Philosophy.</p>

<p>Coud'st thou Infuse into me thy Temper, Sir <hi>James,</hi> I shou'd have thy Reason too; but I am Born to Love this Fickle, Faithless Fair—what have I not Essay'd to Race her from my Breast? But all in Vain; I must have her, or I must not Live.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>James.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, if you are so far gone, my Lord, your Distemper requires an Able Physician—what think you of <hi>Loveley</hi>'s bringing a File of Muscqueteers, and carry her away, <hi>Via &amp; Armis?</hi></p>

<p>That Way might give her Person to my Arms, but where's the Heart?</p>

<speaker>Lady <hi>Lucy.</hi></speaker>
<p>I thank Fortune I neither wish, nor need it, Sir <hi>James;</hi> I presume the next Room is furnish'd with Avarice enough to serve you in that Affair, if it is a Burden to you; or Mrs. <hi>Sago</hi>'s ill Luck may give you an Opportunity of returning some of the Obligations you lye under.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>James.</hi></speaker>
<p>Your Sex, Madam, extorts a Duty from ours,

<speaker>Lady <hi>Lucy.</hi></speaker>
<p>That Superfluity of good Manners, Sir <hi>James,</hi> would do better Converted into Charity; this Town abounds with Objects—wou'd it not leave a more Glorious Fame behind you to be the Founder of some Pious Work; when all the Poor at mention of your Name shall Bless your Memory; than that Posterity shou'd say you Wasted your Estate on Cards and Women?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>James.</hi></speaker>
<p>Humph, 'tis pity she were not a Man, she Preaches so Emphatically. <stage>[Aside.]</stage> Faith, Madam, you have a very good Notion, but something too Early—when I am Old, I may put your Principles in Practice, but Youth for Pleasure was design'd—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady <hi>Lucy.</hi></speaker>
<p>The truest Pleasure must consist in doing Good, which cannot be in Gaming.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>James.</hi></speaker>

<p>Right, Sir <hi>James—</hi>but all these things may be perveted—Cards are harmless Bits of Paper in themselves, yet through them what Mischiefs have been Done? What Orphans Wrong'd? What Tradesmen Ruin'd? What Coach and Equipage dismist for them?</p>

<p>But then, how many fine Coaches and Equipages have they set up, Madam?</p>
