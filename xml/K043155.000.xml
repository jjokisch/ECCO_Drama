<p>THE HUMOURS OF AN ELECTION. A <hi>FARCE.</hi> As it is performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN <hi>COVENT-GARDEN.</hi></p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by the AUTHOR,</byline>
<p>And spoken by Mr. WILSON.</p>
<sp>
<l>BEFORE we poll, the town I wish to sound,</l>
<l>And canvass for your votes and int'rest round:</l>
<l>No bribes I bring, to influence your voice,</l>
<l>Our Candidate aims at, being Freedom's choice;</l>
<l>If unsuccessful, he assures this borough,</l>
<l>He'll call no critic scrutiny to-morrow;</l>
<l>The public judgment, he abides with awe,</l>
<l>And owns your right to give the drama law.</l>
<l>Sir Listless Lounge, with well-bred yawn, declares,</l>
<l>He dreads encount'ring your election bears;</l>
<l>What with the toil of canvassing, he vows,</l>
<l>And making speeches when one's in the house,</l>
<l>So much of rights, and liberties they rave,</l>
<l>In these free states a man's a downright slave!</l>
<l>"Oh! keep one borough, says Paddy, to spare,</l>
<l>"To give Captain Moore a bit of a share,</l>
<l>"He bate four ships, joy, before he took one!</l>
<l>"And he and I came from the very same town."</l>
<l>May we, unblam'd, with Humour's lightest wing,</l>
<l>Thus touch the surface of pure Freedom's spring.</l>
<l>To treat of liberty, in our weak lays,</l>
<l>Is placing soil beneath the diamond's blaze.</l>
<l>Oh, may our arms to that bright gem restore</l>
<l>The splendor which it boasted long before!</l>
<l>Nor need we long despair to see that day,</l>
<l>When vengeance shall foul treachery betray,</l>
<l>Since Cornwallis commands, and Tarlton leads the fray.</l>
<l>Then peace once more shall rear her angel head,</l>
<l>Bright as the Phoenix, from her burning bed.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>YOU are a fool, Letty; you don't know what it is to be married to a parliment-man: he can do such things, child! lord, he can do any thing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Letit.</speaker>
<p>I confess, father, some parliment-men of late have proved they can do any thing. But surely, you can never think my booby cousin will cut any figure in the House of Commons.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Why not, why not, you satyrical baggage?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Letit.</speaker>
<p>He can't say boo! to a goose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>If he can nick the time to say aye, or no, he'll do more than a better orator.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Letit.</speaker>
<p>And to compleat the ridicule, his mother canvasses for him. Sure the spirit of absurdity has descended upon our family, and determined we should be a public laughing-stock. She would have me with her yesterday; and such a tramp as we had! She took me through all the filthy alleys in town; then we were obliged to kiss the children in every house we went into, be they never so dirty, and keep a pocket full of halfpence to slip into her hands; a proof, dear father, of what a bribe can do, when we can purchase nothing but a rattle with it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Why this was mere pastime to what I have gone through on my canvass. I went yesterday to solicit the vote and interest of old Smoke Jack, the chimney-sweeper, and found his whole family seated at a banquet of ox-cheek and bacon. I was pressed to eat you may be sure; so down I sat between his two eldest boys, as he called them, so black! that they looked more like two organized bags of soot than human beings. I sat clear for some time, 'till one of the lads reaching his brother the bread across me, black'd all the side of my coat, which, as ill-luck would have it, happened to be cream-coloured. His father, mad at his ill manners, got up to strike him; when the boy, in striving to escape, threw me and his brother down, and before I got up I was black enough to pass for one of the family.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Letit.</speaker>
<p>And wasn't this sufficient to give you a surfeit of canvassing?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>What, getting a dirty coat? no, no, I never mind dirt in serving my country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
<speaker>Letit.</speaker>
<p>Ah, sir, how happy were we before you took this notion in your head! I then had hopes my dear Belfield would be mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Why he takes pains to provoke me; he has set up in opposition to George; has open'd a house, writes ballads, gets drunk, and is rising every day into consequence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Letit.</speaker>
<p>O, heavens! if he should be return'd, perhaps then, sir, you would relent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Zounds, don't make me mad! he shan't be returned: George shall carry you and his election together.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Letit.</speaker>
<p>He may be returned for the borough of Bribewell, but Belfield has an interest in my heart, which no venal candidate can rob him of.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Letitia.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Grumble as much as you please, ma'am, but I am determined your marriage articles, and the writs for the new parliment, shall be returnable together. I fancy there are sew who can say as much for themselves as Joe Parmazan. I was bred a cheesemonger, 'tis true, but what of that? when I have a son in the house, his cloquence will pare off the rind of my obscurity. I hope, like his father, be'll have all the blue mold of patriotism about him. Let me see, how stand my morning expences, <stage>(<hi>Pulls the different articles out of his pocket as he names them</hi>)</stage> I have above three hundred pounds worth of goods in my pockets, that at a just appraisement would not be valued at twenty shillings; but election wares are ticklish articles, and whilst the fair lasts, keen chapmen will
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>have their prices. Here's a piece of gingerbread that cost me five guineas, that I could have bought for a penny at any baker's in London, but no price is thought too high for real parliment cakes. A child's trumpet too! a pretty play-thing this for a man of my age! It cost me two guineas, and I must wait 'till my grandson is born to blow me a tune upon it. Here's fifty pounds slap in a case of razors. These razors may shave keen, but I think they never will cut so close as the fellow who sold them. Here's a toothpick-case, cost me twenty pounds. If a man was to pay every day in the same proportion for his dinner, he might soon shut up his mouth, and give his teeth a holiday! But oh, monstrous! in this paper I have a hundred hob-nails, for which I paid a hundred pounds down upon the nail; I was nail'd hard in that bargain. Here is some Scotch snuff, and some court sticking-plaister, which cost me very dear; but I don't mind that, as they are articles which will be of great use to the Member when he gets into the house.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Servant.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Canvass, fir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Shew him in.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Servant.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Canvass.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>My deat Canvass, how do you go on?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Can.</speaker>
<p>Swimmingly, swimmingly, sir. I have secured all Corruption-row, Bribewell-alley, and Guzzledown-street, to a single elector.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Was my sister with you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Can.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but she did me more harm than good: she's too old to have any interest with the men, and the elector's wives like to be kissed by the canvasser.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Ecod, so they do, and if possible I should have undertaken the whole canvass myself; but as I am rather too old now for so much business, my dear boy, don't spare yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Can.</speaker>
<p>There's Full Bottom, the barber, what have you done with him? I understand that he can command two votes besides his own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Lord! he's one of us. 'Twas I set him up; he's only a housekeeper three days. He lived in a dark hole he called a shop, at the sign of <hi>Gentlemen shaved for a penny,</hi> upon a paper lanthorn. The other two votes are his journeymen, fellows who have been all their lives garret-housekeepers; but I have given security for a quarter's rent to qualify them.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Servant.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Serv.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Goose, the taylor, sir, has just rode up to the door, and desires to speak with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Bid him come in.</p>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Servant.</stage>
<p>This is one of our sheet-anchors; he lives about seven miles off, and has great interest among the farmers and alehouses. Go you instantly to the Committee, and see that nothing is neglected.</p>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Canvass.</stage>
<p>I have bespoke five suits of clothes of this Goose, and yet the fellow has the impudence to talk of his conscience, and refusing a bribe.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="6" facs="9"/>
<hi>Enter</hi> Goose, <hi>booted and spurred.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Dear Mr. Goose, I have been just wishing for you. Come, sit down, sit down, and tell us the news.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>I have rode hard, Mr. Parmazan, to serve you, and as I take no bribes, I hope my horse hire will be paid for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>You shall have the best gelding in my stable.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>I can't take it; my conscience is buckram to a bribe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>But, my dear friend, consider that you gave me your vote and interest, before I made this offer. Why, if one friend cannot make another friend a present now and then, without incurring the censure of corruption, there's no friendship lest in the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Not a shred. Friendship's like broad-cloth, it wears well in all weathers. But I have had a sad journey of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>I am sorry for that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>The fright, I believe, was the worst of it; for you must know, that this was the first time I ever mounted any thing but a shop-board.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>You must want some refreshment‚ÄîHere, get some wine.‚ÄîWhich do you choose, red or white?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>I have no choice. Good cloth's never of a bad colour.</p>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Servant <hi>with wine.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Then put that pint bottle of the choice Madeira on the table. That bottle, I assure you, is twelve years old.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Mercy on us! it's the littlest thing of its age I ever saw.</p>
<stage>(Taking up the bottle, and looking at it archly.)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Come, George's health to the bottom of your glass.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>I'll not leave a remnant behind me. <stage>(Drinks.)</stage> I made his first suit; who wou'd have thought I was taking measure of a Parliament Man?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Now let us proceed to business.‚ÄîYou must know, my worthy friend, I intend you for a leading man in my committee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>You don't say so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>There's something so consequential in your countenance, so manly in your manner, spite of your profession, that you must command great respect in a croud.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Odzookers, what must I say to them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Huzza! as often as possible. Cry no bribery, no corruption, no hired mob; and if our party meetmuch opposition, cry, no Scotchmen, and it will do wonders.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Aye, damn the Scotch with all my heart; they are no friends to our trade; I hear as how one half of them wear no breeches.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Off to the committee then immediately, and be sure to cry loudly for liberty and property, and the constitution.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Goose.</speaker>
<p>Friend Parmazan, the skirts of the constitution are grown too long. The lappells and buttons are increasing, and they ought to be cut short after a new fashion.</p>
<stage>Exeunt.</stage>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> George <hi>and Mrs.</hi> Highflight.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Hig.</speaker>
<p>Now I shall instruct you in the duty you owe your constituents.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>Why I thought I owed no duty but to father and mother.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Hig.</speaker>
<p>There is a confusion, George, in your ideas, that makes me tremble for your success as a speaker in the House of Commons.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>Sure they won't make me speaker of the House the first time I go in? I can speak to be sure, but I must be a little us'd to my company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Hig.</speaker>
<p>Has your oratorical preceptor been here yet?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>My roar-otorical preceptor, you should call him, for he makes me bawl 'till I am hoarse again. What do you think, mother, he would hav me clap two pebbles in my mouth to make me talk clear. He told me De‚ÄîDe‚ÄîDe, something, a great Grecian parliament man, didn't speak a jot better than me, till he used these pebbles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Hig.</speaker>
<p>I have tried the pebbles myself, child, and I find they wonderfully assist me.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="9" facs="12"/>

<p>Mr. Mac Rhetorick.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mac Rhetorick.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Rhet.</speaker>
<p>I hope I have the honor to find your Ladyship in parfect health. I staid beyond my oor, but I have so many young members from my ain country to instruct for the new Parliment, that I have scarce a minute on my hands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Mac Rhetorick, I have one question to ask you, I never ask'd before. I hope no offence?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rhet.</speaker>
<p>I attend your commands, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>How the dickens can you come to teach me English, when you can't speak it yourself? It is for all the world as if a blind man should go to teach a young horse his paces.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Hig.</speaker>
<p>George, George, I do not like this spirit of opposition.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rhet.</speaker>
<p>He will ken better, Madam, when he is in the hoose. He will then find the value of a Caledonian preceptor.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Parmazan.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Come, bustle, bustle, is our young Candidate almost ready? Yonder go the mob, shouting most delightfully. Banners flying, girls giggling; every thing alive expecting the candidates on the hustings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Rhet.</speaker>
<p>I am very glad, Mr. Parmazan, you are come to be a watness of our young orator's progress in the most noble and perswasive art of eloquence, but do not expect all the flower of a Ceecero from him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Flower! damme, do you think I'd have him a mealy-mouthed speaker?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. High.</speaker>
<p>Brother, your ignorance shocks me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>They are falling out about me; but I'll be shot if I know why; for between my mother's high larning, and my master's broad Scotch, I may as well be amongst the wild Irish, for what knowledge I get.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. High.</speaker>
<stage>(To Mac Rhetorick)</stage>
<p>My brother, Sir, does not expect from your tyro‚Äî</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. High.</speaker>
<p>His tyro.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Where the devil did you get that word? it's not English.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Hig.</speaker>
<p>It's originally Latin, and signifies a young student.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>A young student! it's a better name for a young pointer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>But when am I to speak my speech? I shall forget it. I never can keep one above two hours in my head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rhet.</speaker>
<p>Pegin as soon as you please, Sir, ‚Äî"Consid√™re duces", Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, I do consider the use of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>He shall stand in my great chair, with the back facing us, and he shall have a pillow for a cushion to thump, if he's afraid of his knuckles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>What shall I do? I don't remember a word of what he wrote down for me. <stage>(The chair brought forward)</stage> Ecod, I have a mind to make a speech of my own; I am sure I can do it as well as my master.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Hig.</speaker>
<p>Before, child, you ascend this humble rostrum‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>Lord, mother, what signifies preaching Parson Palmer so often? I have hard words enough in my speech.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. High.</speaker>
<p>Let grace be your grand object.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>How often, mother, have you called me graceless!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rhet.</speaker>
<p>Do not forget your action, ‚Äîaction is the life and soul of oratory, for as Demosthenes‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>That's the man that swallowed the pebbles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parma.</speaker>
<p>Zounds! let the boy speak, we don't want to hear you make speeches.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>No more we don't, uncle, so here goes; but before I begin, I have carried my election, for I am chaired already.</p>

<p>Begin, Sir.‚ÄîGentlemen‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Geo.</speaker>
<p>I think I had better say, neighbours, I'm sure it's more friendly. But if it must be so, ‚ÄîGentlemen, tho' my mother's one of the company, I say, gentlemen, I am your own town's boy, born and bred amongst you.</p>

<p>No, I'll be sworn, for it's English, bad as it is.</p>

<p>You know I am, by prosession, a wine merchant, but, by trade, a justice of peace; therefore, I think I may venture to promise you all my bad debts, and every poor housekeeper in my district.</p>

<p>Nothing like what I had, I scarce sell a dose of physic in a weck; never called up a-nights, except by the mob breaking my windows; no chance customers dropping in for a dose of salts, or to

<p>Mr. Bustle, how do you stand for votes?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bust.</speaker>
<p>Why, let me see‚Äîthere's Will Cogdie, the keeper of the EO table in Black-ball Alley, and his interest; then there's the landlord of the Blue Bear, the Black Horse, the Green Man, and, my bosom friend, Love Frolic, that was put in possession of the round-house last night; all these I can promise, to a certainty, as good reputable votes, besides two Irish cousins of my wife, that at any time are ready to be qualified.</p>

I then give my vote as a plumber and glazier; next as a barber, next as a baker, and last of all in the character of Ned Proteus, an humble retainer to the law, ignominiously distinguished by the name of a pettifogger.</p>

<p>This popular assembly is a glorious sight to a patriotic soul! Here we may behold old Rome again.</p>

<p>Damn old Rome, say I! what's old Rome to Old England?</p>

<speaker>Mrs. Hig.</speaker>
<p>Brother, brother, remember and venerate the race of heroes that sprung from that antique stock.</p>

<speaker>Parm.</speaker>
<p>You are a very antique stock yourself, and you have not produced a justice of peace yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Hig.</speaker>
<p>Remember Regulus, who nobly sacrificed himself for the people, and returned to Carthage; call to mind the Brutus who slew Tarquin, and freed his country; reflect on the conduct of Curtius, who voluntarily jumped into the fiery gulph to close it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Parm.</speaker>
<p>I wish to the Lord somebody would jump into your fiery gulph and close it. 'Sdeath, you'd make a man mad! Instead of jabbering so much about old Rome, and old fellows nobody cares twopence about but yourself, why don't you exert your interest among the electors, and try how many of these honest fellows you can get to give you plumpers.</p>

<p>When Titus Vespasian sat down before the walls of Jerusalem, a Roman matron brought her son to him, a fine youth, as my George may be; I, like the venerable matron, married for the good of the state; so take the offspring of a patriotic Hymen into your service.

<p>Gentlemen, before I go any farther, I beg leave to take up the lady, but all in the way of good manners, for I know she can take me down again if she pleases. 'Tis true, I am by birth an Irishman, but I was bred and born in England, and I believe I am the first of my countrymen who ever met opposition from a lady. I could say a great deal to her upon liberty, and the enjoyment of a free trade; but whenever an Irishman talks upon the subject, he's struck dumb.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I solicit your support, this day, to be returned one of your representatives; because I consider the confidence of the people to be the highest poslible honour an Englishman can boast. It is reposing the most sacred trust in him; from the moment he receives it, he becomes guarantee to the people for the safety of their dearest rights; and cannot neglect or betray them without criminality. If he acts the faithful servant, his wages will be precious; for he will be paid with the love of his country.
<pb n="33" facs="36"/>Whatever my ability be, it shall be exerted in your service; no private views, of interest or ambition, should influence the servant of the people; he should drop <hi>self,</hi> and all the meanness of its dependant passions; and feel, think, and act only for the good and prosperity of the commonweal. If chosen, by your free voices, I pledge myself to act upon this broad scale of honour and truth; and though my talents may want splendor to dazzle in my country's cause, the integrity of my heart shall remain its incorruptible champion.</p>
