<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. MOSSOP.</stage>
<lg>
<l>BESIDE his native Thames our poet long</l>
<l>Hath hung his silent harp, and hush'd his song.</l>
<l>Kind Commerce whisper'd. "See my blissful state,</l>
<l>"And to no smiles but mine resign thy fate.</l>
<l>"Beneath the pregnant branches rest awhile,</l>
<l>"Which by my culture spread this favour'd isle;</l>
<l>"On that fair tree the fruits of ev'ry coost,</l>
<l>"All, which the Ganges and the Volga boast,</l>
<l>"All, which the sun's luxuriant beam supplies,</l>
<l>"Or slowly ripens under frozen skies,</l>
<l>"In mix'd variety of growth arise.</l>
<l>"The copious leaves beneficence diffuse,</l>
<l>"Which on affliction drops restoring dews,</l>
<l>"And birds of hope among the loaded sprays</l>
<l>"Tune with enchantment their alluring lays</l>
<l>"To cheer despondence and th' inactive raise.</l>
<l>"Rest here, she cry'd, and smiling time again</l>
<l>"May string thy lyre, and I approve the strain."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>At length his muse from exile he recalls,</l>
<l>Urg'd by his patrons in Augusta's walls.</l>
<l>Those gen'rous traders, who alike sustain</l>
<l>Their nation's glory on th' obedient main,</l>
<l>And bounteous raise affliction's drooping train.</l>
<l>They, who benignant to his toils afford</l>
<l>Their shelt'ring favour, have his muse restor'd.</l>
<l>They in her future fame will justly share,</l>
<l>But her disgrace herself must singly bear;</l>
<l><pb facs="3"/>
Calm bours of learned leisure they have giv'n,</l>
<l>And could no more, for genius is from heav'n.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>To open now her long-hid roll she tries,</l>
<l>When vary'd forms of pictur'd passions rise.</l>
<l>Revenge and pride their furies first unfold,</l>
<l>By artless virtue fatally controll'd.</l>
<l>Scenes wrought with gentler pencils then succeed,</l>
<l>Where love persuades a faithful wife to bleed;</l>
<l>Where, join'd to publick cares, domestic woe</l>
<l>Is seen from manly fortitude to flow.</l>
<l>But if her colours mock the candid eye</l>
<l>By spurious tincts, unmix'd with nature's dye,</l>
<l>Ye friendly hands, restrain your fruitless aid,</l>
<l>And with just censure let her labours fade.</l>

<speaker>DUMNORIX</speaker>
<stage> <hi>to the Ambassador.</hi></stage>
<l>You come to offer terms. Stand forth and answer.</l>
<l>Did not Prasutagus, her dying lord,</l>
<l>On your insatiate emperor bestow</l>
<l>Half of his rich possessions, vainly deeming,</l>
<l>The rest might pass unpillag'd to his children?</l>
<l>What did you then, ye savage sons of rapine?</l>
<l>You seiz'd the whole inheritance by force,</l>
<l>Laid waste our cities, with the servile scourge</l>
<l>Disgrac'd a royal matron; you deflow'r'd</l>
<l>Her spotless daughters, stole our noblest youth</l>
<l>To serve your pride and luxury in Rome;</l>
<l>Our priests you butcher'd, and our hoary elders,</l>
<l>Profan'd our altars, our religious groves,</l>
<l>And the base-image of your Caesar thrust</l>
<l>Among the gods of Britain: and by heav'n</l>
<l>Do you repair to these victorious tents</l>
<l>With proffer'd peace and friendship?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROMAN <hi>Ambassador.</hi></speaker>
<l>Yes, to treat,</l>
<l>As faith, benevolence and justice dictate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DUMNORIX.</speaker>
<l>How shall we treat with those, whose impious hands</l>
<l>Have rent the sacred bands of mutual trust?</l>
<l>How shall we treat with those, whose stony hearts</l>
<l>Compassion cannot melt, nor shame controll,</l>
<l>Nor justice awe, nor piety restrain,</l>
<l>Nor kindness win, nor gratitude can bind?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

No pillager, like Catus, but a soldier,</l>
<l>To calm and sober discipline inur'd,</l>
<l>He would redress, not widen your complaints.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>DUMNORIX.</speaker>
<l>Can he restore the violated maid</l>
<l>To her untainted purity and fame?</l>
<l>Can he persuade inexorable death</l>
<l>To yield our slaughter'd elders from the grave?</l>
<l>No, nor by soothing tales elude our vengeance.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROMAN <hi>Ambassador.</hi></speaker>
<l>Yet hear us calmly, e'er from yonder hills</l>
<l>You call the legions of imperial Rome,</l>
<l>And wake her eagles, which would sleep in peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOADICIA.</speaker>
<l>Begone, and bear defiance to your legions.</l>
<l>Tell them, I come, that Boadicia comes,</l>
<l>Fierce with her wrongs, and terrible in vengeance,</l>
<l>To roll her chariot o'er their firmest ranks,</l>
<l>To mix their soaring eagles with the dust,</l>
<l>And spurn their pride beneath her horses hoofs.</l>

<l>Of shatter'd cohorts by their fear preserv'd.</l>
<l>Th' embattled nations of our peopled isle,</l>
<l>Yet fresh from sev'nty thousand slaughter'd Romans,</l>
<l>Shall add yon refuse to the purple heap.</l>
<l>And yet amid triumphant desolation,</l>
<l>Though flames each Roman colony devour,</l>
<l>Though each distracted matron view her infant</l>
<l>Grasp with its tender hands the piercing spear,</l>
<l>Though your grey fathers to the falchion's edge</l>
<l>Each feeble head surrender, my revenge</l>
<l>Will pine unsated, and my greatness want</l>

<l>Go, and report this answer to Suetonius.</l>
<l>Too long have parents sighs, the cries of orphans,</l>
<l>And tears of widows, signalized your sway,</l>
<l>Since your ambitious Julius first advanc'd</l>
<l>His murd'rous standard on our peaceful shores.</l>
<l>At length unfetter'd from his patient sloth,</l>
<l>The British genius lifts his pond'rous hands</l>
<l>To hurl with ruin his collected wrath</l>
<l>For all the wrongs, a century hath borne,</l>
<l>In one black period on the Roman race.</l>

<l>Not the wealth,</l>
<l>Which loads the palaces of sumptuous Rome,</l>

<l>The hungry ravens, which inhabit round</l>
<l>The chalky cliffs of Albion, shall assemble</l>

The name of Romans? did the ancient spirit</l>

<l>Might well prefer a noble fate to chains;</l>

<l>Give one kind accent to thy dying wife,</l>
<l>Ere yet my ears be frozen, and thy voice</l>

<l>Yes, I will utter to thy dying ear</l>
<l>All my fond heart, sustain thee on my bosom,</l>

<l>Oh! wheresoe'er thy fleeting breath shall pass,</l>
<l>Whate'er new body, as the Druids sing,</l>
<l>Thou shallt inform hereafter, still thy soul,</l>
<l>Thou gentle, kind, and ever-pleasing creature;</l>
<l>Shall bear its own felicity along,</l>
<l>Still in its native sweetness shall be bless'd,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>DUMNORIX.</speaker>
<l>Love thee! Behold, when Albion groans around me,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>VENUSIA.</speaker>
<l>Oh! extacy! which stops my parting soul,</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. HAVARD.</stage>
<l>NOW we have shewn the fatal fruits of strife,</l>
<l>A hero bleeding with a virtuous wife,</l>
<l>A field of war embru'd with nation's gore,</l>
<l>Which to the dust the hopes of Albion bore,</l>
<l>If weak description, and the languid flow</l>
<l>Of strains unequal to this theme of woe</l>
<l>Have fail'd to move the sympathyzing breast,</l>
<l>And no soft eyes their melting sense exprest;</l>
<l>Not all the wit, this after scene might share,</l>
<l>Can give success, where you refus'd a tear;</l>
<l>Much less, if haply still the poet's art</l>
<l>Hath stol'n persuasive to the feeling heart.</l>
<l>Will he with fancy's wanton hand efface</l>
<l>From gen'rous minds compassion's pleasing trace,</l>
<l>Nor from their thoughts, while pensive they pursue</l>
<l>This maze of sorrow, snatch the moral clue:</l>
<l>If yet to him those pow'rs of sacred song</l>
<l>To melt the heart and raise the mind belong.</l>
<l>Dar'd he to hope, this sketch of early youth</l>
<l>Might stand th'award of nature and of truth:</l>
<l>Encourag'd thus, hereafter might he soar</l>
<l>With double strength, and loftier scenes explore,</l>
<l>And following fortune through her various wiles,</l>
<l>Shew struggling virtue, dress'd in tears, or smiles;</l>
<l>Perhaps his grateful labours would requite</l>
<l>With frequent off'rings one propitious night.</l>
