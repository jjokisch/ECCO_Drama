<p>ALONZO.</p>
<p>A TRAGEDY. IN FIVE ACTS. As it is performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL, DRURY-LANE.</p>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>THE author of the following Tragedy, has, in his former attempts of the same kind, avoided to trouble the reader with either dedication or preface. His chief reason for declining this common mode of appearing before the public, was the necessity, which it would lay him under, of speaking concerning himself and his works. The success of Alonzo calls upon him to depart from his former plan; and to break that silence, which might now be reckoned arrogant, and even ungrateful, to those, from whom he in a great measure derives his success.</p>
<p>He embraces with pleasure, this occasion, to acknowledge his obligations to THE MANAGERS of the theatre, whose friendly, anxious, and active zeal he hath so often experienced: TO THE PERFORMERS, who have so strenuously contended with each other, in their very generous endeavours to embellish the representation of the piece: To MRS. BARRY—but the public voice has exalted HER above his praise: Yet he claims the merit of
<pb facs="4"/>having, before others, observed her now allowed and unrivalled excellency. From the colour of the dawn, he foretold the brightness of the day.</p>
<p>For MRS. BARRY he wrote the part of Ormisinda, and the most flattering circumstance to him, in the success of his play, is the universal opinion, (vouched, not only by the loudest applause that ever shook the stage, but by the greatest effusion of tears) that the ACTRESS so much exalted THE CHARACTER, that she exceeded all imagination, and reached the summit of perfection.</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. PALMER.</byline>
<sp>
<l>WHILST ardent Zeal for India's Reformation,</l>
<l>Hath fired the Spirit of a generous Nation;</l>
<l>Whilst Patriots of presented Lacks complain,</l>
<l>And Courtiers Bribery to Excess arraign;</l>
<l>The Maxims of Bengal still rule the Stage,</l>
<l>The Poets are your Slaves from Age to Age.</l>
<l>Like Eastern Princes in this House you sit,</l>
<l>The Soubahs, and Nabobs of suppliant Wit;</l>
<l>Each Bard his Present brings, when he draws near,</l>
<l>With Prologue first, he sooths your gracious Ear;</l>
<l>We hope your Clemency will shine to Day,</l>
<l>For tho' despotic, gentle in your Sway.</l>
<l>These conscious Walls if they cou'd speak wou'd tell,</l>
<l>How seldom by your Doom, a Poet fell:</l>
<l>Your Mercy oft suspends the Critics Laws,</l>
<l>Your Hearts are partial, to an Author's Cause.</l>
<l>Pleas'd with such Lords, content with our Condition,</l>
<l>Against your Charter we will ne'er petition.</l>
<l>If certain Folks, should send us a Committee,</l>
<l>(Like that which lately visited the City)</l>
<l>Who without special Leave of our Directors,</l>
<l>At the Stage Door shou'd enter as Inspectors;</l>
<l>Altho' their Hearts were arm'd with triple Brass,</l>
<l>Thro' our resisting Scenes, they could not pass.</l>
<l>Lyons and Dragons too keep watch and ward,</l>
<l>Witches and Ghosts the awful entrance guard;</l>
<l>Heroes who mock the pointed Sword are here,</l>
<l>And desperate Heroines who know no Fear;</l>
<l><pb facs="6"/>
If as Rinaldo stout each Man should prove,</l>
<l>To brave the Terrors of the inchanted Grove,</l>
<l>Here on this Spot, the Center of our State,</l>
<l>Here on this very Spot they'd meet their Fate.</l>
<l>The Prompter gives the Sign, and down they go;</l>
<l>Alive descending to the Shades below.</l>
<l>To you whose Empire still may Heav'n maintain,</l>
<l>Who here by antient Right and Custom reign,</l>
<l>Our Lions couch, our Dragons prostrate fall,</l>
<l>Witches and Ghosts obey your potent Call.</l>
<l>Our Heroines smile on you with all their Might,</l>
<l>Our boldest Heroes tremble in your Sight,</l>
<l>Even now with anxious Hearts they watch your Eyes,</l>
<l>Should you but frown, even brave <hi>ALONZO</hi> flies.</l>

<l><seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS roll contains the secret of my life,</l>
<l>And of the state: My marriage with Alonzo,</l>
<l>The story of my son, my injured child,</l>
<l>Bred in a desert, tho' the heir of Spain.</l>
<l>To thee, my faithful friend, my lov'd Teresa!</l>
<l>This precious record I commit. Oh! keep it</l>
<l>From sight of human eye, till better times:</l>
<l><pb n="2" facs="9"/>For still I hope that better times may come,</l>
<l>Tho' not to me, to this afflicted land.</l>
<l>My hand hath signed it, and my act to day</l>
<l>Shall give it faith and credence with mankind.</l>
<l>This will explain the mystery of my fate,</l>
<l>And tell the world why Ormisinda died.</l>
</sp>
<stage>[Gives the writing.]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>TERESA.</speaker>
<p>Do not too soon despair.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>I wait the last</l>
<l>Decisive moment. But to guard my soul</l>
<l>Against the sallies of a rash despair,</l>
<l>Against the weakness which attends surprise,</l>
<l>I have forecast whatever may befall,</l>
<l>And fram'd to the event my firm resolve.</l>
<l>This is the day appointed for the combat,</l>
<l>Between a Moorish and a Christian knight,</l>
<l>To end the wars of Spain, and fix the fate</l>
<l>Of the contending nations.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TERESA.</speaker>
<l>Antient times,</l>
<l>If tales of antient times may be believ'd,</l>
<l>Have known such combats. In her infant state,</l>
<l>Against her rival Alba, Rome was pledg'd</l>
<l>As now Asturia is: But later times</l>
<l>Afford no parallel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="10"/>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>There never was,</l>
<l>Nor will there ever, while the world endures,</l>
<l>Be found a parallel to my distress—</l>
<l>I am the victor's prize—whoe'er prevails</l>
<l>He gains the princess, and the crown of Spain.</l>
<l>Such is the solemn treaty, sworn, confirm'd,</l>
<l>By every rite, which either nation owns.</l>
<l>Mean while I am Alonzo's wedded wife—</l>
<l>I am a mother—by the false Alonzo,</l>
<l>Who from his hate to me abandons Spain,</l>
<l>Which he alone can save. No other arm</l>
<l>Can match Mirmallon's force. Proud of his strength</l>
<l>Already in the lists the Moor exults,</l>
<l>Secure of victory. The setting sun</l>
<l>Concludes the dreadful period of suspence,</l>
<l>And death alone from infamy can save me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TERESA.</speaker>
<l>He yet may come. Far in the Nubian wilds,</l>
<l>That guard the secret sources of the Nile,</l>
<l>Velasco found the chief. The wind of spring,</l>
<l>The constant East, this year forgot its season,</l>
<l>And only since this moon her light renew'd,</l>
<l>Began to blow upon the western shore.</l>
<l>On that I build a hope.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>I have no hope!</l>
<l>Review the story of my life, Teresa,</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="11"/>And by the past conjecture of the future.</l>
<l>First my lamented brother, blindly led</l>
<l>By proud Ramirez, quarrell'd with Alonzo,</l>
<l>Then by Alonzo's sword Ramirez fell.</l>
<l>For that offence to banishment condemn'd,</l>
<l>Alonzo won me to accept his hand</l>
<l>Before he left this kingdom. Since that time,</l>
<l>What I have suffer'd, Heav'n, and you can tell.</l>
<l>It was the fifth, a memorable day,</l>
<l>After our marriage, when he fail'd to come,</l>
<l>At the appointed place to meet his bride.</l>
<l>Then' midst my fear, anxiety, and sorrow,</l>
<l>For only death I thought, or dangerous harm,</l>
<l>Could keep him from my arms, amaz'd I heard</l>
<l>That he was gone for Asia. To this hour,</l>
<l>Ev'n to this present hour, no cause assign'd</l>
<l>But these distracted lines long after sent:</l>
<l>"Thou never shalt behold Alonzo more;</l>
<l>"The foul, foul cause thy guilty conscience knows."</l>
<l>My conscience knows no cause, so help me Heav'n!</l>
<l>Now, in my utmost need, this dreadful day,</l>
<l>When I must struggle with despair and Death,</l>
<l>To keep myself a chaste, a blameless wife,</l>
<l>And to my silent grave the secret bear,</l>
<l>That my dear son and his may live to wield</l>
<l>The sceptre of his fathers!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TERESA.</speaker>
<l>To this hour,</l>
<l>Thy husband knows not that he is a father.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="5" facs="12"/>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>His ears, his eyes are shut. Oft' have I sent</l>
<l>Letters, that would have piere'd an heart of stone;</l>
<l>Pleading for pity, begging but to know,</l>
<l>Wherein I had unwittingly offended;</l>
<l>But every letter, with unbroken seal,</l>
<l>To me return'd. He will not read one word</l>
<l>From my detested hand.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TERESA.</speaker>
<l>'Tis very strange,</l>
<l>And much unlike the way of other men.</l>
<l>For tho' they are inconstant in their love,</l>
<l>There is a course and process in the change.</l>
<l>Ardent at first, their ardor lasts not long.</l>
<l>With easy, full, secure possession cloy'd,</l>
<l>Their passion palls, and cold indifference comes,</l>
<l>As chilly autumn steals on summer's prime,</l>
<l>Making the green leaf yellow. Then it is</l>
<l>That some new beauty takes their roving eyes,</l>
<l>And fires their fancy with untasted charms.</l>
<l>But in a moment, from excess of love,</l>
<l>To the extreme of hate Alonzo pass'd</l>
<l>Without a cause. Nor did another come</l>
<l>Between thee and the current of his love.</l>
<l>'Tis moon-struck madness, or the dire effect</l>
<l>Of incantation, charm, compulsive spell,</l>
<l>By magie fasten'd on his wretched soul.</l>
<l>It can be nothing else.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="13"/>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>Whate'er it is,</l>
<l>He shuns all woman-kind. His life is spent</l>
<l>In war and in devotion. When the field</l>
<l>Is won, the warrior lays aside his spear,</l>
<l>Takes up the pilgrim's staff, and all alone,</l>
<l>Obscur'd in homely weeds, he bends his course</l>
<l>To some remote, religious, holy place,</l>
<l>Where he exceeds the strictest penitent,</l>
<l>In penances severe and sad austerity.</l>
<l>Sometimes in deeper melancholy wrapt</l>
<l>He loaths the sight of man, and to the cliffs</l>
<l>Of hoary Caucasus or Atlas flies,</l>
<l>Where all the dreary winterhe remains,</l>
<l>And, desolate, delights in desolation.</l>
<l>My faithful fervant Juan saw him once</l>
<l>Upon the ledge of Atlas; on a rock</l>
<l>Beside the empty channel of a brook,</l>
<l>He stood and gaz'd intent a cataract</l>
<l>Which, as it tumbled from a cliff, the blast</l>
<l>Had caught mid-way, and froze before it fell.</l>
<l>Juan drew near and call'd. He turn'd about,</l>
<l>Look'd at him for a space, then wav'd him back,</l>
<l>And mounting swiftly sunk behind the hill.</l>
<l>Wan was his face, and like a statue pale!</l>
<l>His eye was wild and haggard! Oh! Teresa,</l>
<l>Amidst my woes, my miseries, my wrongs!</l>
<l>My bosom bleeds for him!</l>

<speaker>TERESA.</speaker>
<l>Something there is</l>
<l>Mysterious and unfathomable here,</l>
<l>Which passes human wisdom to divine.</l>
<l>The hand of fate is on the curtain now.</l>
<l>Within my breast a firm persuasion dwells,</l>
<l>That in the lists Alonzo will appear.</l>
<l>Behold in haste the king your father comes,</l>
<l>And seems the messenger of welcome tidings.</l>

<stage><hi>Enter the</hi> KING.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>I come in this alarming hour, my child,</l>
<l>To pour a ray of comfort on thy heart.</l>
<l>A valiant Moor, once captive of my sword,</l>
<l>And ever since, my firm but secret friend,</l>
<l>Acquaints me that a champion is at hand,</l>
<l>Shunning those honors which the Moors would pay:</l>
<l>Dark and reserv'd he travels thro' their towns</l>
<l>Without a name. I judge it is Alonzo,</l>
<l>For the description best accords with him.</l>
<l>Scorning his foes, offended with his friends,</l>
<l>Shrouded in anger and in deep disdain,</l>
<l>Like some prime planet in eclipse he moves,</l>
<l>Gaz'd at and fear'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>It is! It is Alonzo!</l>
<l>Welcome, most welcome, in whatever shape.</l>
<l>The hero comes to save his native land,</l>
<l>To save the honor of the Christian name,</l>
<l><pb n="8" facs="15"/>And o'er the fading crescent of the Moor</l>
<l>Exalt the holy cross.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>And, ev'n as thine</l>
<l>Is the consenting voice of all the land.</l>
<l>The hope of Spain on brave Alonzo rests.</l>
<l>In this I see the ruling hand of heav'n,</l>
<l>Which to its own eternal purpose leads,</l>
<l>By winding paths, the steps of erring man!</l>
<l>Painful it were to speak of those events</l>
<l>Sad and disastrous which have laid us low.</l>
<l>Unjustly was Alonzo banish'd hence,</l>
<l>And happily the hero now returns.</l>
<l>For since my son, your valiant brother, fell,</l>
<l>With an impartial mind I have enquir'd</l>
<l>And trac'd the story of Alonzo's birth.</l>
<l>He is the offspring of our antient kings,</l>
<l>The rightful heir of Riccaredo's line,</l>
<l>Called the Catholic, who reign'd in Spain</l>
<l>Before the first invasion of the Moors.</l>
<l>Lost in the gen'ral wreck, buried and hid</l>
<l>Beneath the ruins of a fallen state,</l>
<l>Obscure, unknown, the royal infant lay,</l>
<l>When I, indignant of a foreign yoke,</l>
<l>In wild Asturia rose against the Moors.</l>
<l>The righteous cause prevail'd; the baffled foe</l>
<l>Retir'd, and left us and our mountains free.</l>
<l>The grateful people chose their leader king.</l>
<l><pb n="9" facs="16"/>I knew not then, nor did my people know,</l>
<l>Ought of Alonzo.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>I have heard him own</l>
<l>The justice of thy title to command</l>
<l>And rule the state thy valor had restor'd.</l>
<l>Enough, he said, remain'd for him to conquer?</l>
<l>The fertile provinces of ample Spain,</l>
<l>Which still the Moor usurps.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Of all mankind,</l>
<l>He is the champion whom my soul desires</l>
<l>This day to fight for Spain and for my aughter;</l>
<l>Not only for his great renown in arms,</l>
<l>But for his birth, his lineage, and his blood.</l>
<l>If his unconquer'd arm in fight prevails,</l>
<l>The antient monarchy shall rise again,</l>
<l>In all its splendor and extent of empire.</l>
<l>The streams of royal blood divided now,</l>
<l>Shall roll a tide united thro' the land.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>Thy heart dilates with pleasing hopes, my father!</l>
<l>And fond anticipates its own desire.</l>
<l>But who can tell the purpose of Alonzo?</l>
<l>His strange approach no friendly aspect bears:</l>
<l>He comes the foe determin'd of the Moors,</l>
<l>But not to us a friend.</l>

<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="17"/>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Of that no fear.</l>
<l>I know him proud, impetuous, and fierce,</l>
<l>Haughty of heart, and high of hand: Too prompt</l>
<l>On all occasions to appeal to arms.</l>
<l>But he was ever gentle to my daughter:</l>
<l>The proud Alonzo bow'd the knee to thee.</l>
<l>At his departure I observ'd thy grief,</l>
<l>And in my mind—</l>
</sp>
<stage>(A trumpet sounds.)</stage>
<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<l>Thy presence, Sir,</l>
<l>Is at the camp requir'd. Both nations arm,</l>
<l>And rush to battle: Loud the Moors complain</l>
<l>Of violated faith. A Spanish knight</l>
<l>They say has broke the treaty, and attack'd</l>
<l>Their bands, of peace secure.</l>

<l>Who can this headlong warrior be?</l>
<l>Too well Alonzo knows the laws of war,</l>
<l>Too much reveres the treaty feal'd and sworn,</l>
<l>To make a rash attempt upon the Moors.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>If it is he, 'tis no deliberate act,</l>
<l>No treacherous intention to assail</l>
<l>The Moors unguarded. Yet it may be he:</l>
<l>My mind misgives me that it is Alonzo.</l>
<l>Ill would his swelling spirit brook the sight</l>
<l>Of Moorish tents and arms on yonder plain.</l>
<l>If as he pass'd, one slighting word was dropt,</l>
<l>With tenfold scorn to that he would reply,</l>
<l>Nor hesitate alone to draw his sword</l>
<l>Amidst an host of Moors.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TERESA.</speaker>
<l>The clamor sinks.</l>
<l>Whate'er it was, the tumult is appeas'd.</l>
<l>And now what does my Ormisinda think</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>Oh! my dear Teresa!</l>
<l>Thy fond desire to chear my hopeless heart</l>
<l>Makes thee forever to my mind present</l>

<speaker>TERESA.</speaker>
<l>Ha! dost thou doubt</l>
<l>Still of his coming?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>No, I think 'tis he;</l>
<l>But hope and fear alternate sway my mind:</l>
<l>Like light and shade upon a waving field</l>
<l>Coursing each other, when the flying clouds</l>
<l>Now hide and now reveal the sun of heav'n.</l>
<l>I tremble for the issue of the combat;</l>
<l>And if my Lord should, as I hope, prevail,</l>
<l>I tremble for myself: Afraid to see,</l>
<l>Tho' sick with strong impatience to behold him,</l>
<l>And learn why he forsook his Ormisinda.</l>
<l>He says I know the cause. Oh! most unjust!</l>
<l>Was it because I lov'd him to excess,</l>
<l>Altho' his title shook my father's throne?</l>
<l>Was it because I join'd my fate to his,</l>
<l>And fondly chose to wed a banish'd man?</l>
<l>For such are my demerits.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TERESA.</speaker>
<l>'Tis but vain</l>
<l>Thus to torment thyself, and rack thy mind</l>
<l>With sad conjectures, at a time like this,</l>

<l>No, Ormisinda, I perceive no change,</l>

<l>The beam that gilds the early morn of youth</l>

<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>HAMET, impartial justice shall be done,</l>
<l>And thou I know as justly wilt report it:</l>
<l>Thou art the friend of peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HAMET.</speaker>
<l>Therefore I sought</l>
<l>This office; for in yonder camp, O! King,</l>
<l>Some counsellors there are who urg'd the Caliph</l>
<l>To take advantage of this fair occasion</l>
<l>And hold the treaty void.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>That I believe,</l>

<l>My guards are gone to bring th' offender hither.</l>

<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="23"/>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Ha! by Heaven, he's but a youth,</l>
<l>A beardless boy, and like a woman fair.</l>
<l>He moves my pity much. Unhappy youth!</l>
<stage>[To the prisoner.]</stage>
<l>Art thou the chief of that unruly band,</l>
<l>Who broke the treaty and assail'd the Moors?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUTH.</speaker>
<l>No chief, no leader of a band am I.</l>
<l>The leader of a band insulted me,</l>
<l>And those he led basely assail'd my life</l>
<l>With bad success indeed. If self-defence</l>
<l>Be criminal, O King! I have offended.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<stage>[<hi>To Hamet.</hi>]</stage>
<l>With what a noble confidence he speaks!</l>
<l>See what a spirit thro' his blushes breaks!</l>
<l>Observe him, Hamet.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HAMET.</speaker>
<p>I am fix'd upon him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Didst thou alone engage a band of Moors</l>
<l>And make such havoc? Sure it cannot be.</l>
<l>Recall thy-scattered thoughts. Nothing advance</l>
<l>Which proof may overthrow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="17" facs="24"/>
<speaker>YOUTH.</speaker>
<l>What I have said</l>
<l>No proof can overthrow. Where is the man,</l>
<l>Who speaking from himself, not from reports</l>
<l>And rumors idle, will stand forth and say</l>
<l>I was not single when the Moors attack'd me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HAMET.</speaker>
<l>I will not be that man, tho' I confess,</l>
<l>That I came hither to accuse thee, Youth!</l>
<l>And to demand thy punishment.—I brought</l>
<l>The tale our soldiers told.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUTH.</speaker>
<p>The tale was false.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HAMET.</speaker>
<l>I thought it true; but thou hast shook my faith.</l>
<l>The seal of truth is on thy gallant form,</l>
<l>For none but cowards lie.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Thy story tell,</l>
<l>With every circumstance which may explain</l>
<l>The seeming wonder; how a single man</l>
<l>In such a strife could stand?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUTH.</speaker>
<l>'Twill cease to be</l>
<l>A wonder, when thou hear'st the story told.</l>
<l>This morning on my road to Oviedo</l>
<l><pb n="18" facs="25"/>A while I halted near a Moorish post.</l>
<l>Of the commander I enquir'd my way,</l>
<l>And told my purpose, that I came to see</l>
<l>The famous combat. With a scornful smile,</l>
<l>With taunting words and gestures he replied,</l>
<l>Mocking my youth. Advis'd me to return</l>
<l>Back to my father's house, and in the ring</l>
<l>To dance with boys and girls. He added too</l>
<l>That I should see no combat. That no knight</l>
<l>Of Spain durst meet the champion of the Moors.</l>
<l>Incens'd I did indeed retort his scorn.</l>
<l>The quarrel grew apace, and I defied him,</l>
<l>To a green hill, which rose amidst the plain,</l>
<l>An arrow's flight or farther from his post.</l>
<l>Alone we sped: at once we drew, we fought.</l>
<l>The Moorish captain fell. Enrag'd his men</l>
<l>Flew to revenge his death. Secure they came</l>
<l>Each with his utmost speed. Those who came first</l>
<l>Single I met and slew. More wary grown</l>
<l>The rest together join'd, and all at once</l>
<l>Assail'd me. Then I had no hopes of life.</l>
<l>But suddenly a troop of Spaniards came</l>
<l>And charg'd my foes, who did not long sustain</l>
<l>The shock, but fled, and carried to their camp</l>
<l>That false report which thou, O King! hast heard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Now by my sceptre, and my sword, I swear,</l>
<l>Thou art a noble youth. An angel's voice</l>
<l><pb n="19" facs="26"/>Could not command a more implicit faith</l>
<l>Than thou from me hast gain'd. What think'st thou, Hamet?</l>
<l>Is he not greatly wrong'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HAMET.</speaker>
<l>By Allah! yes.</l>
<l>The voice of truth and innocence is bold,</l>
<l>And never yet could guilt that tone assume.</l>
<l>I take my leave impatient to return,</l>
<l>And satisfy my friends that this brave youth</l>
<l>Was not th' aggressor.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>I expect no less</l>
<l>From gen'rous Hamet.</l>
</sp>
<stage>[<hi>Exit</hi> Hamet <hi>and Moors.</hi>]</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Tell me, wondrous Youth!</l>
<l>For much I long to know; what is thy name?</l>
<l>Who are thy parents? Since the Moor prevail'd.</l>
<l>Thecottage and the cave have oft' conceal'd</l>
<l>From hostile hate the noblest blood of Spain:</l>
<l>Thy spirit speaks for thee. Thou art a shoot</l>
<l>Of some illustrious stock, some noble house</l>
<l>Whose fortunes with their falling country fell.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>YOUTH.</speaker>
<l>Alberto is my name. I draw my birth</l>
<l>From Catalonia; in the mountains there</l>
<l><pb n="20" facs="27"/>My father dwells, and for his own domains</l>
<l>Pays tribute to the Moor. He was a soldier:</l>
<l>Oft' I have heard him of your battles speak,</l>
<l>Of Cavadonga's and Olalles' field.</l>
<l>But ever since I can remember ought,</l>
<l>His chief employment and delight have been</l>
<l>To train me to the use and love of arms;</l>
<l>In martial exercise we past the day;</l>
<l>Morning and evening, still the theme was war.</l>
<l>He bred me to endure the summer's heat,</l>
<l>And brave the winter's cold: To swim across</l>
<l>The headlong torrent, when the shoals of ice</l>
<l>Drove down the stream. To rule the fiercest steed</l>
<l>That on our mountains run. No savage beast</l>
<l>The forest yields that I have not encounter'd.</l>
<l>Meanwhile my bosom beat for nobler game;</l>
<l>I long'd in arms to meet the foes of Spain,</l>
<l>Oft I implor'd my father to permit me,</l>
<l>Before the truce was made, to join the host.</l>
<l>He said it must not be, I was too young</l>
<l>For the rude fervice of these trying times.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<p>Did he permit you now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERTO.</speaker>
<l>A strange adventure</l>
<l>Forc'd me from home. Not many days ago,</l>
<l>When hunting in the woods, I heard a voice,</l>
<l><pb n="21" facs="28"/>A woman's voice, calling aloud for help.</l>
<l>I rush'd into the thicket; there I saw</l>
<l>A moorish Lord, for brutal licence fam'd,</l>
<l>Who shamefully abus'd a rural maid</l>
<l>Of Spanish race. I free'd her from his arms.</l>
<l>The moor spake not a word, but mad with rage</l>
<l>Snatch'd up his lance, which stood against a tree,</l>
<l>And at me flew. I turn'd his point aside,</l>
<l>And with a slender javelin pierc'd his heart.</l>
<l>I hasten'd home, but did not find my father;</l>
<l>Nor was it sase to wait for his return.</l>
<l>I took the fairest armour in the hall,</l>
<l>And hither bent my course. The rest thou know'st.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Thou art a prodigy, and fill'ft my mind</l>
<l>With thoughts profound and expectation high.</l>
<l>When in a nation, humbled by the will</l>
<l>Of Providence, beneath an haughty foe,</l>
<l>A person rises up, by nature rear'd,</l>
<l>Sublime, above the level of mankind;</l>
<l>Like that bright bow, the hand of the most High</l>
<l>Bends in the wat'ry cloud: He is the sign</l>
<l>Of prosp'rous change and interposing Heav'n:</l>
<l>And thou, if right I read—</l>
</sp>
<stage>(Enter Messenger.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<l>The champion, Sir,</l>
<l>Who comes to fight for Spain, is near at hand:</l>
<l><pb n="22" facs="29"/>One of our scouts has seen him and his trian,</l>
<l>But brings a strange report, which damps the heart</l>
<l>Of every Spaniard. It is not Alonzo.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>What say'st thou? God of heaven! Not Alonzo!</l>
<l>Who is he then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<l>That is not fully known.</l>
<l>Clad in the flowing vesture of the east,</l>
<l>A Persian turban on his head he wears,</l>
<l>Yet he's a christian knight. To mark his falth,</l>
<l>Holy, and adverse to Mohammed's law,</l>
<l>Before his steps a silken banner borne</l>
<l>Streams in the wind, and shews a golden cross,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<p>Send out another scout.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<l>There is not time</l>
<l>To go and to return.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Begone, begone,</l>
<l>And let me be obey'd. Alas! my hopes</l>
<l>Are vanish'd like a dream.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERTO.</speaker>
<l>I grieve to see</l>
<l>The king afflicted.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="23" facs="30"/>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Ah! Thou dost not know</l>
<l>How deep these tidings strike.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERTO.</speaker>
<l>Is not the king</l>
<l>Free to accept or to refuse the aid</l>
<l>This stranger offers?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<p>If I am, what then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERTO.</speaker>
<l>Be not offended, Sir, at my presumption,</l>
<l>For from my heart I speak, a loyal heart,</l>
<l>True to my sov'reign and my native land.</l>
<l>If this is not Alonzo, why should he,</l>
<l>Or any stranger fight the cause of Spain?</l>
<l>Are there not warriors born of Spanish race,</l>
<l>Who court the combat?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>To my words attend.</l>
<l>The Moorish champion is of great renown;</l>
<l>In stature like the giant race of old,</l>
<l>Like Anak's true, or Titan's fabled sons.</l>
<l>Against the foe nor sword nor spear he lifts,</l>
<l>But in his might secure, a mace he wields,</l>
<l>Whose sway resistless breaks both shield and arm,</l>
<l>And crushes head and helmet. Thus he fights</l>
<l><pb n="24" facs="31"/>Whose fatal prowess turn'd the doubtful scale</l>
<l>Of three successive battles. He is deem'd</l>
<l>Invincible but by Alonzo's arm:</l>
<l>Therefore our warriors, tho' they know no fear,</l>
<l>No fear of ought that can themselves befal,</l>
<l>Anxious for Spain, to great Alonzo yield,</l>
<l>And on his valour rest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERTO.</speaker>
<l>Oft' have I heard</l>
<l>My father speak of brave Alonzo's deeds;</l>
<l>What can with-hold him when his country calls?</l>
<l>Perhaps the last of combats he has fought,</l>
<l>And in the silent tomb the hero rests.</l>
<l>But, since he's absent, from whatever cause,</l>
<l>O! let no stranger knight his place assume,</l>
<l>To bring dishonour on the Spanish name.</l>
<l>If this gigantic champion of the Moors,</l>
<l>Clad in the glory of his battles won,</l>
<l>Dazzles the warriors, and confounds their valour,</l>
<l>Let me, tho' young in arms, the combat claim,</l>
<l>On me his fame has no impression made.</l>
<l>I'll meet the giant with a fearless heart.</l>
<l>It beats for battle now. Oft have I kill'd</l>
<l>The wolf, the boar, and the wild mountain bull,</l>
<l>For sport and pastime. Shall this Moorish dog</l>
<l>Resist me fighting in my country's cause?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="25" facs="32"/>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>By heaven and earth, thou mov'st me much! thy words</l>
<l>Have stirr'd the embers of my youthful fire.</l>
<l>Thou mak'st me wish I could recal those days,</l>
<l>When of an age like thine, and not unlike</l>
<l>To thee in face and form, I rais'd the spear</l>
<l>Against the Moor, in Cava's bloody field.</l>
<l>Then by my hand the great Alchammon fell,</l>
<l>The strength and pillar of the Caliph's host.</l>
<l>Then I was sit to meet Mirmallon's arm.</l>
<l>But now, my hairs are grey, my steps are slow,</l>
<l>My sword descending breaks the shield no more:</l>
<l>Our foes have known it long.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERTO.</speaker>
<l>O! King, thou art</l>
<l>Thy country's great deliv'rer, and the sole</l>
<l>Restorer of the state. Pelagio's fame</l>
<l>Shall never die: But let thy counsel now</l>
<l>(As oft thy valour) save this land from shame.</l>
<l>Let not a foreign warrior take the field,</l>
<l>And snatch the glory from the lance of Spain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>My voice alone cannot determine that.</l>
<l>The council sit assembled near the lists,</l>
<l>To them I will present thee. If this knight</l>
<l>Unknown, who from that distant egion comes,</l>
<l>Where the bright sun lights up his golden lamp,</l>
<l>Bears not some high pre-eminence about him,</l>
<l><pb n="26" facs="33"/>Which marks him out our surest safest choice,</l>
<l>My voice is for a Spaniard, and for thee!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERTO.</speaker>
<l>Upon my knees, that ne'er were bow'd before</l>
<l>To mortal man, I thank thee!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Rise, Alberto!</l>
<l>To me no thanks are due. A greater King,</l>
<l>The King of Kings, I deem hath chosen thee</l>
<l>To be the champion of his law divine</l>
<l>Against the Insidel.—If not for this,</l>
<l>For some great purpose sure thou art ordain'd.</l>
<l>Bred in the desert, and by heav'n endued</l>
<l>With force and valor marvellously great,</l>
<l>Conducted by a hand unseen, thyself</l>
<l>Not knowing whither, and this day produc'd</l>
<l>Before the nations.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERTO.</speaker>
<l>Ah! my soul's on fire!</l>
<l>Should such a glorious destiny be mine!</l>
<l>May I intreat to go without delay?</l>
<l>I fear some gallant warrior may step forth</l>
<l>And claim the fight before me.</l>

<l>It is a false report. In times like these</l>
<l>The minds of men are credulous and weak:</l>
<l>To rumor's shifting blast they bow and bend,</l>
<l>Like corn of slender reed to every wind:</l>
<l>Thou know'st that from the East Alonzo comes.</l>
<l>Might not the hasty messenger mistake</l>
<l>For him some turban'd warrior of his train?</l>

<l>He has not yet attain'd the prime of youth,</l>

<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>'Tis well! I wish'd to speak with thee alone.</l>
<l>Velasco! tho' to thee but little known,</l>
<l>I did in part reveal my secret soul,</l>
<l>Told thee the feign'd Abdallah was Alonzo</l>
<l>Further than that, thou hast not sought to know,</l>

<l>On sea and shore, that some men would have thought</l>
<l>Most opportune,</l>

<l>True, Velasco!</l>

<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>I have a tale to tell, that will amaze,</l>

<l>Of Asia and of Africa have heard it.</l>
<l>The rocky cliffs of Caucasus and Atlas</l>
<l>Have echo'd my complaints: But never yet</l>
<l>The human ear receiv'd them. Thou hast heard</l>
<l>Already more than ever mortal did.</l>
<l>Thou know'st the princess?</l>

<p>Her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<l>Not many of the court have been more honour'd</l>
<l>With opportunities to know her worth;</l>
<l>And there is none who more her worth reveres.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>Her worth! Thou may'st as well revere a fiend,</l>
<l>The blackest fiend, that dwells in burning hell,</l>
<l>Is not more opposite to all that's good</l>
<l>Than Ormisinda.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<p>What a strain is this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>'Tis true, by every high and holy name,</l>
<l>That binds a soldier's and a prince's vow:</l>
<l><pb n="38" facs="45"/>I swear, Velasco, she's the vilest woman</l>
<l>That e'er disgrac'd her sex. The most abandon'd,</l>
<l>The hardiest, most determin'd in her vice,</l>
<l>That ever wrong'd a fond believing heart.</l>
</sp>

<l>You start and shudder like a man</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<p>And so I am.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>And now you lift your eye-lids up and stare</l>
<l>With looks full of conjcture and suspicion,</l>
<l>As if you doubted of my sober mind.</l>
<l>I am not mad, Velasco, tho' sometimes</l>
<l>I have been near, yes, very near to madness;</l>
<l>By that bad woman craz'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<l>O! Would to heav'n!</l>
<l>That this afflicting moment of my life</l>
<l>Were a delirious dream! Unreal all</l>
<l>That's heard and spoken now! But how, my Lord,</l>
<l>Art thou so much affected by her crimes?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I am her husband.</p>

<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<p>Heav'n for that be prais'd!</p>
</sp>

<l>How dar'st thou thus profane the name of heav'n,</l>
<l>And mock my misery? Thou art mad, I think;</l>
<l>The frenzy which thou wished'st has come upon thee</l>
<l>Beware, for if this extasy endures,</l>
<l>My sword secures thy silence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<l>O! forgive me,</l>
<l>Noble Alonzo, royal, I should say,</l>
<l>Doubly my master now. There's not a man,</l>
<l>Whose veins contain one drop of Spanish blood,</l>
<l>Who does not wish thee wedded to the princess.</l>
<l>And for her virtue! Thou hast long been absent,</l>
<l>Reserv'd, retir'd, and sad. I'll stake my soul,</l>
<l>Some villain has belied thy faithful wife,</l>
<l>And snar'd thy easy faith.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>Take heed, take heed!</l>
<l>I am the villain who accuse the princess,</l>
<l>And thou shalt be her judge.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<l>Eternal power!</l>
<l>What should I think of this?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="40" facs="47"/>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>Listen to me.</l>
<l>I have perplex'd thee, and have marr'd the story</l>
<l>By my abruptness. 'Tis a serious story,</l>
<l>Not to be told in parcels and by starts,</l>
<l>As I from impotence of mind began,</l>
<l>But I will bear my swelling passion down,</l>
<l>And utter all my shame. Thou dost remember</l>
<l>How I was banish'd from my native land?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<p>For killing young Ramirez.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>At that time</l>
<l>I doated on the princess. She conjur'd me</l>
<l>With earnest pray'rs, with deluges of tears,</l>
<l>Not to resist her father, nor advance</l>
<l>My better title to the crown of Spain,</l>
<l>As I had once resolv'd. My rage she sooth'd,</l>
<l>Pride, anger, int'rest, yielded all to love.</l>
<l>With her I made a merit of obedience,</l>
<l>And pleaded so effectually my cause,</l>
<l>That she consented to a private marriage,</l>
<l>Before I left the kingdon. We were married,</l>
<l>And met together, four successive nights,</l>
<l>In the sequestered cottage of the wood,</l>
<l>Behind the palace garden. O! I thought</l>
<l>Myself the happiest and the most belov'd</l>
<l>Of all mankind. She mock'd me all the while;</l>
<l><pb n="41" facs="48"/>Meant me the cover of her loose amours.</l>
<l>A cloak to hide her shame. O God! O God!</l>
<l>Did I deserve no better?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<l>Good my Lord!</l>
<l>What circumstance to warrant such conclusion?</l>
<l>What evidence?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>The evidence of sight—</l>
<l>Mine eyes beheld: I saw myself dishonour'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<p>Your eyes beheld!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>By Heav'n and Hell—they did.</l>
<l>The night preceding the appointed day</l>
<l>Of my departure, from the realm of Spain,</l>
<l>I slew impatient to the place of meeting,</l>
<l>Before the hour was come: To wear away</l>
<l>The tedious time, for ev'ry minute seem'd</l>
<l>An age to me, I struck into the wood</l>
<l>And wander'd there, still steering to the gate</l>
<l>By which she was to enter. Tho' the trees</l>
<l>The moon full orb'd in all her glory shone.</l>
<l>My am'rous mind a sportful purpose form'd,</l>
<l>Unseen to watch the coming of my bride,</l>
<l>And wantonly surprize her. Near the gate</l>
<l>There stood an aged tree. It was a beech,</l>
<l>Which far and wide stretch'd forth its level arms</l>
<l><pb n="42" facs="49"/>Low, near the ground, and form'd a gloomy shade.</l>
<l>Behind its trunk I took my secret stand;</l>
<l>The gate was full in view, and the green path</l>
<l>On which it open'd. There I stood awhile,</l>
<l>And soon I heard the turning of the key.</l>
<l>My heart beat thick with joy—and forth she came:—</l>
<l>Not as I wish'd: She had a minion with her;</l>
<l>A handsome youth was tripping by her side,</l>
<l>Girt with a sword, and dress'd in gay attire.</l>
<l>He seem'd to court her, as they pass'd along,</l>
<l>Coy, but not angry, for I heard her laugh.</l>
<l>She flung away. He follow'd, soon o'erttok her,</l>
<l>Embrac'd her—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<p>Ah! The Princess Ormisinda!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>I drew my sword, that I remember well,</l>
<l>And then an interval like death ensued.</l>
<l>When consciousness return'd, I found myself</l>
<l>Stretch'd at my length upon the naked ground</l>
<l>Under the tree: My sword lay by my side.</l>
<l>The sudden shock, the transport of my rage,</l>
<l>And grief, had stopt the current of my blood,</l>
<l>And made a pause of life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<l>Alas! my Lord!</l>
<l>'Twas piteous indeed. What did'st thou do,</l>
<l>When life and sense return'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="43" facs="50"/>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>With life and sense,</l>
<l>My rage return'd. Stumbling with haste, I ran</l>
<l>To sacrifice them to my just revenge.</l>
<l>But whether they had heard my heavy fall,</l>
<l>Or that my death-like swoon had lasted long,</l>
<l>I know not, but I never saw them more.</l>
<l>I search'd till morning; then away I went,</l>
<l>Resolv'd to scorn the strumpet, and forget her.</l>
<l>But I have not been able to forget</l>
<l>Nor to despise her; tho' I hate her more</l>
<l>Than e'er I lov'd her, still her image haunts me</l>
<l>Where'er I go. I think of nothing else</l>
<l>When I'm awake, and never shut my eyes</l>
<l>But she's the certain vision of my dream.</l>
<l>Sometimes, in all her loveliness she comes</l>
<l>Without her crimes: In extasy I wake,</l>
<l>And wish the vision had endur'd for ever.</l>
<l>For these deceitful moments, O! my friend!</l>
<l>Are the sole pleasant moments which Alonzo</l>
<l>For eighteen years has known.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<l>Within that time,</l>
<l>What regions barbarous hast thou explor'd,</l>
<l>What strange vicissitudes of life endur'd</l>
<l>In action and repose.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>Extremes of both</l>
<l>I courted to relieve my tortur'd mind:</l>
<l><pb n="44" facs="51"/>But the tormenter still my steps attends;</l>
<l>Behind me mounts, when thro' the ranks of war</l>
<l>I drive my fiery steed; and when I seek</l>
<l>The hermit's cell, the fiend pursues me there.</l>
<l>Time, which they say the wounds of passion cures</l>
<l>In other hearts, inflames and festers mine.</l>
<l>There's but one remedy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<p>Would I could name one!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>Her life. The unction for the serpent's bite</l>
<l>Is the fell serpent's blood. I'll have her life.</l>
<l>Th' adulteress with infamy shall die,</l>
<l>By public justice doom'd. With this intent</l>
<l>Disguis'd I come. If in my proper shape</l>
<l>I had appear'd, alarm'd she would have sled,</l>
<l>And bafiled my revenge.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<l>My Lord, pemit me</l>
<l>One thing to mention, which these eyes beheld,</l>
<l>Altho' it squares not just with thy opinion.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<l>Good my Lord! with patience hear.</l>
<l>When first I was to this employment nam'd,</l>
<l>Which since I have so happily discharg'd,</l>
<l>The Princess sent and call'd me to her presence.</l>
<l><pb n="45" facs="52"/>The treaty with the Moor engross'd her thoughts.</l>
<l>That sad and pensive air she always wears</l>
<l>Was settled to a thicker gloom of grief.</l>
<l>Her voice was low and languid. Few her words,</l>
<l>And the short periods ended with a sigh.</l>
<l>But when I gave her hopes of thy return,</l>
<l>A sudden gleam of joy spread o'er her face,</l>
<l>Like morning breaking in a cloudy sky.</l>
<l>With earnest voice, still rising as she spoke,</l>
<l>She urg'd dispatch, exhorted me to zeal</l>
<l>And perseverance, Never to desist</l>
<l>Till I had found thee: For her fate, she said,</l>
<l>The fate of Spain, depended on Alonzo.</l>
<l>Her passion then burst in a flood of tears</l>
<l>That choak'd her utterance.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>And thou didst believe</l>
<l>That ev'ry word she spoke was most sincere.</l>
<l>How to interpret her let me instruct thee.</l>
<l>Whate'er she utters with unusual warmth,</l>
<l>As the effusion genuine of her heart,</l>
<l>Receive and construe in another sense</l>
<l>Reverse and opposite; for that's the truth.</l>
<l>The words she spoke, her sights, the tears she shed,</l>
<l>Were all from apprehension of my coming,</l>
<l>Not as they seem'd, for fear I should not come.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>VELASCO.</speaker>
<p>'Tis dreadful that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="46" facs="53"/>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>'Tis horrible, 'tis monstrous!</l>
<l>When I for her had way'd my right to reign,</l>
<l>The right undoubted of the Gothic line,</l>
<l>And stoop'd, enamour'd, to that base decree</l>
<l>From Spain, which banish'd the true heir of Spain,</l>
<l>That she should pitch on me to be her fool,</l>
<l>And pour such infinite contempt upon me.</l>
<l>But four days married! Fond, to madness fond!</l>
<l>And on the very eve of my departure!</l>
<l>She would not for a single day refrain,</l>

<l>I have heard</l>
<l>Stories and tales enough of female falshood,</l>

<l>But this surpasses all.</l>

<l>All wicked women</l>

<p>We thank thy care, Velasco!</p>
<stage><hi>To</hi> ABDALLAH.</stage>
<l>Illustrious Prince! whom love of glory brings</l>
<l>From regions so remote, to fight for Spain,</l>
<l>Accept the thanks a grateful nation pays</l>
<l>To her defender.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>Monarchof Asturia!</l>
<l>The nations of the East have heard thy praise.</l>
<l>Had not the hand of Time unstrung thine arm,</l>
<l>Spain never would have sought for foreign aid</l>
<l>To quell her foes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>'Tis better far for Spain</l>
<l>That I am old: For in my warlike days,</l>
<l>When in the prime of flow'ring youth I fought,</l>
<l>I equall'd not thy friend. Above his own,</l>
<l><pb n="48" facs="55"/>Above the strength of ev'ry mortal arm!</l>
<l>Alonzo thine exalts.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ABDALLAH.</speaker>
<l>Three times we fought</l>
<l>With equal fortune on the Wolga's banks;</l>
<l>He for the Monguls, I against them stood.</l>
<l>But at our last encounter, on my helm</l>
<l>His faithless blade broke short, and in his hand</l>
<l>The useless hilt remain'd. My sword I dropt,</l>
<l>And in my arms the valiant chief embrac'd.</l>
<l>Our friendship thus commene'd, and since that time</l>
<l>We have been brothers sworn, and leagu'd in arms.</l>
<l>Alonzo, fighting in my cause, receiv'd</l>
<l>That wound which now detains him from the field.</l>
<l>Urg'd by affection, and by honor bound,</l>
<l>For him I come against the soes of Spain.</l>
<l>But of myself more than enough is said;</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ALBERTO.</speaker>
<l>That Prince of Persia is compos'd of pride;</l>
<l>He did not deign to look upon the present,</l>
<l><pb n="51" facs="58"/>But stretch'd his sun-burnt hand straight out before him,</l>
<l>Like a blind man, and would have stood so still,</l>
<l>Had I not made his fingers feel the pearls.</l>
<l>And all the while he star'd me in the face,</l>
<l>As if he meant t'oppress me with his eye,</l>
<l>And fright me with his fierce and uncouth looks.</l>
<l>I blush'd at first, but anger came at last,</l>
<l>And bore me up.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN.</speaker>
<l>Those princes of the East,</l>
<l>Us'd to the servile manners of their country,</l>
<l>Where ev'ry prostrate slave adores his lord,</l>
<l>Without intention shock the sons of Europe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERTO.</speaker>
<l>O! how unlike to him the King of Spain,</l>
<l>And that most gentle Princess, Ormisinda!</l>
<l>Her look, her voice, benign and mild, dispel</l>
<l>The awe her rank inspires, and reassure</l>
<l>The modest mind. Would'st thou believe, Sebastian,</l>
<l>She talk'd to me, I cannot tell how long,</l>
<l>Before thou cam'st, and question'd me minutely</l>
<l>How I had liv'd, how past my youthful days?</l>
<l>I fear I was too copious in my answers.</l>
<l>What signifies my rural life to her?</l>
<l>And yet she seem'd to listen with delight,</l>
<l>As if she had an int'rest in my fate;</l>
<l>And once or twice when I of danger spoke,</l>
<l><pb n="52" facs="59"/>From which I hardly had escap'd with life,</l>
<l>Methought I saw her tremble. Much she blam'd</l>
<l>My rashness; yet she prais'd my courage too.</l>
<l>With all her tenderness of heart, I see</l>
<l>That she admires true valour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN.</speaker>
<l>So she does.</l>
<l>The bravest knight that e'er was clad in steel,</l>
<l>Alonzo, was the lover of her youth:</l>
<l>And since he left this land she ne'er rejoic'd,</l>
<l>But of these matters I will tell thee more</l>
<l>At a convenient season. Let us follow,</l>
<l>And join the train before they reach the lists.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALBERTO.</speaker>
<l>I would not lose one moment of this sight</l>
<l>For half the lands of Spain. Tho' I abhor</l>
<l>The Persian, yet I pray devoutly for him.</l>

<l>THIS city looks as if a pestilence</l>

<l>Why should this desolation frighten me?</l>
<l>Why should I fear to see a grave-clad ghost,</l>

<sp>

<l>Look yonder, flying swifter than the wind,</l>
<l>A horseman comes; now at the gate he lights,</l>

<speaker>SEBASTIAN.</speaker>
<l>Joy to the Princess! Victory and peace!</l>
<l>The Moor is slain by brave Abdallah's hand.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>Blest be thy tongue, Sebastian! Thou shalt find</l>
<l>Some better recompence than barren thanks</l>
<l>For these glad tidings. But the gen'rous Prince</l>
<l>Who fought for Spain—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN.</speaker>
<l>Safe and without a wound,</l>
<l>Fresh for another foe, Abdallah stands.</l>
<l>Short was the combat: Soon the boaster fell,</l>
<l>Who durst defy the Christian world to arms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>The God of battles, whom Abdallah serves,</l>
<l>Has overthrown the infidel, whose trust</l>
<l>Was in his own right arm.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN.</speaker>
<l>If I should live</l>
<l>Ten thousand years, I never could forget</l>
<l>The solemn prelude and the fierce encounter.</l>
<l>Thou know'st the place appointed for the combat,</l>
<l>An amphitheatre by nature form'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<p>I know it well.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN.</speaker>
<l>The hills, of various slope</l>
<l>And shape, which circle round the spacious plain,</l>
<l><pb n="56" facs="63"/>Were cover'd with a multitude immense</l>
<l>Of either sex, of every age and rank,</l>
<l>Christian and Moor; whose faces and attire</l>
<l>Strangely diversified the living scene.</l>
<l>Within the lists a gallery was rais'd</l>
<l>In which thy father and the Moorish prince</l>
<l>Sate with their peers, the judges of the field.</l>
<l>To them the knights with slow and stately pace</l>
<l>Approach'd; and bound by sacred oaths declar'd</l>
<l>That they no charm nor incantation us'd,</l>
<l>But trusted in their valour and their arms.</l>
<l>With low obeisance then they both fell back;</l>
<l>And first the Moor (for he the challenge gave)</l>
<l>March'd to the middle of the listed field;</l>
<l>There seiz'd his ponderous mace, beneath whose weight,</l>
<l>The brawny bearer bow'd; and round his head,</l>
<l>Like a light foil, he flourish'd it in air.</l>
<l>On him with diff'rent thoughts the nations gaz'd.</l>
<l>But suddenly a flash of light and flame</l>
<l>Struck ev'ry eye from brave Abdallah's shield,</l>
<l>Cover'd till then. 'Twas made of polish'd steel,</l>
<l>Which shone like adamant; and to a point</l>
<l>Rose in the centre, stanting on each side.</l>
<l>This shield the Persian Prince advancing bore</l>
<l>On his left arm outstretch'd, and in his right,</l>
<l>Thrown back a little, gleam'd a pointed sword.</l>
<l>Erect and high the bold Mirmallon stood,</l>
<l>And sternly ey'd his near-approaching oe.</l>
<l>Then forward sprung, and on the flaming shield</l>
<l>Discharg'd a mighty blow, enough to crush</l>
<l><pb n="57" facs="64"/>A wall, or split a rock. The Spaniards gave</l>
<l>A general groan.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>That was the dreadful sound</l>
<l>We heard, Teresa.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN.</speaker>
<l>Glancing from the shield,</l>
<l>Aside the mace descended. Then enrag'd,</l>
<l>Once more the Moor his thund'ring weapon rear'd.</l>
<l>In stept the Prince, and raising high his shield,</l>
<l>Midway he met the blow; and with the strength</l>
<l>And vigour of his arm, obliquely down</l>
<l>The pond'rous mace he drove. Then quick as thought,</l>
<l>His better hand and foot at once advancing,</l>
<l>Plung'd in Mirmallon's throat his thirsty blade.</l>
<l>The giant stagger'd for a little space;</l>
<l>Then falling, shook the earth. The Christians rais'd</l>
<l>A shout that rent the air. Away I came,</l>
<l>Happy to be the bearer of such tidings.</l>

<l>Thou shalt have ample and immediate justice.</l>

<sp>

<l>Hast thou a husband! God of heav'n and earth!</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>O! I have reason to remember that.</l>
<l>There is no calendar so just and true</l>
<l>As the sad mem'ry of a wife forsaken.</l>
<l>The years, the months, the weeks, the very days,</l>
<l>Are reckon'd, register'd, recorded there!</l>
<l>And of that period I could cite such times,</l>
<l>So dolorous, distressful, melancholy,</l>
<l>That the bare mention of them would excite</l>
<l>Amazement how I live to tell the tale.</l>
<l>But I forget the present in the past.</l>
<l>No wonder, for this moment is the first</l>
<l>That opes the sluices of a heart o'ercharg'd,</l>
<l><pb n="62" facs="69"/>And bursting with a flood of grief conceal'd.</l>
<l>But I must turn me to another theme.</l>
<l>The earnest eyes of all are bent on me,</l>
<l>Watching my looks, and prying to discern</l>
<l>Symptoms of innocence or signs of guilt.</l>
<l>Hear then the frank confession of my soul:</l>
<l>I have transgress'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<l>Stain of a noble race!</l>
<l>Dost thou avow thy crime?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORMISINDA.</speaker>
<l>Mistake me not,</l>
<l>I have transgress'd my duty to my father:</l>
<l>Without his knowledge, and against his will,</l>
<l>Mov'd by a tender lover's parting tears,</l>
<l>I join'd myself in wedlock to Alonzo.</l>
<l>My King, my father, pardon the offence,</l>
<l>Which against thee I own I have committed:</l>
<l>But may I ne'er of God or man be pardon'd,</l>
<l>Nor friend nor father ever pity me,</l>
<l>If I have swerv'd one step from virtue's path,</l>
<l>Or broke the smallest parcel of that vow</l>
<l>Which binds a faithful wife! O! Prince of Persia!</l>
<l>Thou art the est of friends and benefactors;</l>
<l>Thou com'st to end my most distracting woes,</l>
<l>And to dispel th' impenetrable cloud</l>
<l>That darken'd all my days. Now I shall know</l>
<l>Why I have been abandon'd and forsaken,</l>
<l>Why I have been detested and despis'd,</l>
<l><pb n="63" facs="70"/>As never woman was. Proceed, my Lord.</l>
<l>And whilst thou keenly dost assail my life,</l>
<l>And, dearer far, my honor and my fame,</l>

<l>From thee, I hope, the end of all my cares.</l>

<l>BEFORE this day she ne'er beheld the boy.</l>
<l>Far from this place in Catalonia bred.</l>
<l>He came to see the famous combat fought.</l>
<l>'Twas he, my Lord, who slew the Moorish chief,</l>
<l>And in his own defence such wonders wrought.</l>
<l>That action to the Princess made him known,</l>

<l>Who, and from whence he was.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Pity it were</l>

<l>Ay, and against Abdallah,</l>

<l>How can I spare him?</l>

<l>The truth-mark'd story he to me has told.</l>
<l>Detected thus, confounded and surpris'd,</l>
<l>Pierc'd with a thousand eyes, that gaze upon her,</l>
<l>And dart conviction; can she still deny,</l>
<l>And by denial, make her guilt ambiguous?</l>
<l>But if her sex's genius is so strong</l>
<l>That she the port of innocence maintains,</l>
<l>And, from the fulness and excess of vice,</l>
<l>Derives a boldness, that may look like virtue,</l>
<l>Then let the sword decide.</l>

<l>I will adopt the counsel of Velasco,</l>

<p>O heaven and earth, a youth! It was Teresa.</p>

<l>Yes, that memorable night,</l>

<speaker>ALONZO.</speaker>
<l>No matter why?</l>
<l>I saw thee then, and thought thee what thou seem'dst.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mrs. BARRY.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>THO' lately dead, a Princess, and of Spain,</l>
<l>I am no Ghost, but Flesh and Blood again!</l>
<l>No time to change this Dress, it is expedient,</l>
<l>I pass for British, and your most obedient.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>How happy, Ladies, for us all—That we,</l>
<l>Born in this Isle, by Magna Charta free,</l>
<l>Are not like Spanish Wives, kept under Lock and Key.</l>
<l>The <hi>Spaniard now,</hi> is not like him of Yore,</l>
<l>Who in his whisker'd face, his Titles bore!</l>
<l>Nor Joy, nor Vengeance made him smile or grin,</l>
<l>Fix'd were his features, tho' the Devil within!</l>
<l>He, when once jealous, to wash out the Stain,</l>
<l>Stalk'd home, stabb'd Madam, and stalk'd out again.</l>
<l>Thanks to the times, this Dagger-drawing passion,</l>
<l>Thro' polish'd Europe, is quite out of Fashion.</l>
<l><hi>Signor Th' Italian,</hi> quick of sight and hearing,</l>
<l>Once ever lisf'ning, and for ever leering,</l>
<l>To <hi>Cara Sposa,</hi> now politely kind,</l>
<l>He, best of Husbands, is both deaf and blind.</l>
<l><hi>Mynheer the Dutchman,</hi> with his sober pace,</l>
<l>Whene'er be finds his Rib has wanted Grace,</l>
<l>He feels no Branches sprouting from his Brain,</l>
<l>But Calculation makes of Loss and Gain,</l>
<l>And when to part with her, occasion's ripe,</l>
<l>Mynheer turns out mine Frow, an smokes his pipe.</l>
<l>When a brisk <hi>Frenchman's</hi> Wife is giv'n to prancing,</l>
<l>It never spoils his Singing or his Dancing:</l>
<l><pb facs="95"/>
Madams, you false—de tout mon Coeur—Adieu;</l>
<l>Begar you Cocu me, I Cocu you.—</l>
<l>He, torjours gai, dispels each jealous Vapour,</l>
<l>Takes Snusf, sings Vive l'amour, and cuts a Caper.</l>
<l>As for <hi>John Bull</hi>—not he in upper Life,</l>
<l>But the plain Englishman, who loves his Wife;</l>
<l>When honest John, I say, has got his doubts,</l>
<l>He sullen grows, scratches his head, and pouts.</l>
<l><hi>What is the Matter with you, Love?</hi> Cries She;</l>
<l><hi>Are you not well, my Dearest?</hi> Humph! Cries He:</l>
<l><hi>You're such a Brute!—But, Mr. Bull, I've done:</hi></l>
<l>And if I am a Brute—Who made me one?</l>
<l><hi>You know my tenderness—My heart's too full,</hi></l>
<l>And so's my head—I thank you Mrs. Bull.</l>
<l><hi>O you base Man!</hi>—Zounds, Madam, there's no bearing,</l>
<l>She falls a weeping, and he falls a swearing:</l>
<l>With Tears and Oaths, the Storm domestick ends.</l>
<l>The Thunder dies away, the rain descends,</l>
<l>She sabs, he melts, and then they kiss and Friends.</l>
<l>Whatever case these modern Modes may bring,</l>
<l>A little Jealousy is no bad thing:</l>
<l>To me, who speak from Nature unrefin'd,</l>
<l>Jealousy is the Bellows of the Mind.</l>
<l>Touch it but gently, and it warms desire,</l>
<l>If handled roughly, you are all on Fire!</l>
<l>If it stands still, Affection must expire!</l>
<l>This Truth, no true Philosopher can doubt.</l>
<l>Whate'er you do—let not the Flame go out.</l>
