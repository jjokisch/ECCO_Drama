<p>THE following Scenes were written with
no other View than to serve Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi>
last Year at his Benefit; and to expose a
Set of People, (the <hi>Daffodils</hi>) whom the Author
thinks more prejudicial to the Community,
than the various Characters of <hi>Bucks, Bloods,</hi>
<hi>Flashes</hi> and <hi>Fribbles,</hi> which have by Turns infested
the Town, and been justly ridicul'd upon
the Stage. He expects no Mercy from the Critics:
But the more indulgent Public, perhaps,
will excuse his Endeavours to please them, when
they shall know, that the Performance was
plan'd, written, and acted in less than a Month.</p>

<byline>WRITTEN AND SPOKEN
By Mr. GARRICK.</byline>
<lg>
<l>WHY to this Farce this Title given,</l>
<l>Of <hi>Seventeen Hundred Fifty Seven?</hi></l>
<l>Is it a Register of Fashions,</l>
<l>Of Follies, Frailties, fav'rite Passions?</l>
<l>Or is't design'd to make appear,</l>
<l>How happy, good, and wise you were,</l>
<l>In this same <hi>memorable</hi> Year?</l>
<l>Sure with our Author Wit was scarce,</l>
<l>To croud so many Virtues in a Farce.</l>
<l>Perhaps 'tis meant to make you stare,</l>
<l>Like Cloths hung out at Country Fair;</l>
<l>On which strange Monsters glare and grin,</l>
<l>To draw the gaping Bumpkins in.—</l>
<l>Tho' 'tis the Genius of the Age,</l>
<l>To catch the Eye with Title-Page;</l>
<l>Yet here we dare not so abuse ye—</l>
<l>We have some Monsters to amuse ye.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Ye Slaves to Fashion, Dupes of Chance;</l>
<l>Whom Fortune leads her fickle Dance:</l>
<l>Who, as the <hi>Dice</hi> shall smile or frown,</l>
<l>Are rich and poor, and up and down;</l>
<l>Whose Minds eternal Vigils keep;</l>
<l>Who—like <hi>Macbeth,</hi> have murder'd Sleep!—</l>
<l>Each modish Vice this Night shall rise,</l>
<l>Like <hi>Banquo</hi>'s Ghost, before your Eyes;</l>
<l><pb facs="5"/>
While, conscious you, shall start and roar—</l>
<l><hi>Hence, horrid Farce!—we'll see no more!</hi>—</l>
<l>—Ye Ladies, too—Maids, Widows, Wives—</l>
<l>Now tremble for your naughty Lives!</l>
<l>How will your Hearts go pit-a-pat?—</l>
<l>Bless me!—Lord!—what's the Fellow at?—</l>
<l>Was Poet e'er so rude before?</l>
<l>Why sure the Brute will say no more—</l>
<l>Again!—O Gad!—I cannot bear—</l>
<l>Here—you Boxkeeper,—call my Chair:</l>
<l>Peace, Ladies—'tis a false Alarm—</l>
<l>To <hi>YOU</hi> our Author means no Harm.</l>
<l>His Female Failings all are Fictions:</l>
<l>To which your Lives are Contradictions.</l>
<l>Th' unnatural Fool has drawn a Plan,</l>
<l>Where Women like a worthless Man,</l>
<l>A Fault ne'er heard of since the World began.</l>
<l>This Year he lets you steal away—</l>
<l>But if the next you trip or stray;</l>
<l>His Muse, he vows, on you shall wait,</l>

<stage>Enter ARABELLA, and SOPHIA in Men's Cloaths.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p><seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>NDEED, my Dear, you'll repent this
Frolic.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, my Dear, then it will be the
first Frolic I ever repented in all my
Life. Lookee, <hi>Bell,</hi> 'tis in vain to
oppose me, for I am resolv'd—the only Way to
find out his Character, is to see him thus, and converse
freely with him. If he is the Wretch he is
reported to be, I shall away with him at once;
and if he is not, he will thank me for the Trial, and
our Union will be the stronger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>I never knew a Woman yet, who had Prudence
enough to turn off a pretty Fellow, because he had
a little more Wickedness than the rest of his Neighbours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Then I will be the first to set a better Example.
—If I did not think a Man's Character was of some
Consequence, I should not now run such Risques, and
encounter such Difficulties, to be better acquainted
with it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Ha, <hi>Sophy!</hi> if you have Love enough to be jealous,
and Jealousy enough to try these Experiments
—don't imagine, tho' you should make terrible
Discoveries, that you can immediately quit your Inclinations,
with your Breeches; and return so very
philosophically to your Petticoats again, ha, ha!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>You may be as merry with my Weaknesses, as
you please, Madam; but I know my own Heart,
and can rely upon it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>We are great Bullies by Nature; but Courage
and Swaggering, are two Things, Cousin.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Since you are as little to be convinc'd, as I am to
be persuaded—your Servant—</p>
<stage>[Going.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Nay, <hi>Sophy</hi>—This is unfriendly—if you are resolv'd
upon your Scheme, open to me without Reserve,
and I'll assist you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p><hi>Imprimis,</hi> then; I confess to you, that I have a
kind of whimsical Attachment to <hi>Daffodil</hi>; not but
I can see his Vanities, and laugh at 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>And like him the better for 'em—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! don't plague me, <hi>Bell</hi>—my other Lover,
the jealous Mr. <hi>Tukely</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Who loves you too well to be successful—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>And whom I really esteem—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>As a good Sort of Man, ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Nay, shou'd have lov'd him—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Had not a prettier Fellow stept in between, who
perhaps does not care a Farthing for you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>That's the Question, my Dear—<hi>Tukely,</hi> I say,
either stung by Jealousy, or unwilling to lose me,
without a Struggle, has intreated me to know more
of his Rival, before I engage too far with him—
Many strange Things he has told me, which have
piqu'd me I must confess, and I am now prepar'd
for the Proof.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>You'll certainly be discover'd, and put to Shame.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>I have secur'd my Success already.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>I have seen him, convers'd with him, and am to
meet him again to-day, by his own Appointment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Madness!—it can't be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>But it has been, I tell you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>How? how?—Quickly, quickly, dear <hi>Sophy?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>When you went to Lady <hi>Fanny</hi>'s last Night, and
left me, as you thought, little dispos'd for a Frolic,
I dress'd me as you see, call'd a Chair, and went to
the <hi>King's-Arms</hi>—ask'd for my Gentleman, and
was shewn into a Room—he immediately left his
Company, and came to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>I tremble for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>I introduc'd myself as an <hi>Italian</hi> Nobleman, just
arriv'd: <hi>Il Marchese di Macaroni</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Ridiculous!—ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>An Intimate of Sir <hi>Charles Vainlove</hi>'s, who is now
at <hi>Rome</hi>—I told him my Letters were with my
Baggage, at the <hi>Custom-house</hi>—He receiv'd me
with all the Openness imaginable, and wou'd have
introduc'd me to his Friends; I begg'd to be excus'd,
but promis'd to attend him to-day, and am
now ready, as you see, to keep my Word.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Astonishing!—and what did you talk about?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Of various Things—Women among the rest; and
tho' I have not absolutely any open Acts of Rebellion
against him, yet, I fear he is a Traytor at Heart
—and then such Vanity!—but I had not Time
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
to make great Discoveries—It was merely the Prologue—
The Play is to come.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Act your Part well, or we shall hiss you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Never fear me; you don't know what a mad,
raking, wild young Devil I can be, if I set my Mind
to it, <hi>Bell.</hi></p>
<stage>[Laying hold of her.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>You fright me!—you shall positively be no Bedfellow
of mine any longer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>I am resolv'd to ruin my Woman, and kill my
Man, before I get into Petticoats again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Take Care of a Quarrel tho'—a Rival may be
too rough with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>No, no, Fighting is not the Vice of these Times;
and as for a little Swaggering—damn it, I can do it as
well as the best of 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Hush, hush! Mr. <hi>Tukely</hi> is here—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Now for a Trial of Skill; if I deceive him, you'll
allow that half my Business is done.</p>
<stage>[She walks aside, takes out a Glass, and looks at
the Pictures.</stage>
</sp>
<stage>Enter TUKELY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>Your Servant Miss <hi>Bell</hi>—I need not ask if
Miss <hi>Sophy</hi> be at home, for I believe I have seen her
since you did.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Have you, Sir? You seem disconcerted, Mr.
<hi>Tukely</hi>: Has any Thing happen'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>A Trifle, Madam—but I was born to be trifled
with, and to be made uneasy at Trifles.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Pray, what trifling Affair has disturb'd you thus?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>What's the Matter now?</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKLY.</speaker>
<p>I met Miss <hi>Sophy</hi> this Moment in a Hackney Chair,
at the End of the Street: I knew her by the Pink
Negligeè; but upon my crossing the Way to speak
to her, she turn'd her Head away, laugh'd violently,
and drew the Curtain in my Face.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>So, so; well said, Jealousy.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>She was in Haste, I suppose, to get to her Engagement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, Madam; I imagine she had some Engagement
upon her Hands—But sure, Madam, her
great Desire to see her more agreeable Friends, need
not be attended with Contempt and Disregard to
the rest of her Acquaintance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Mr. <hi>Tukely,</hi> I have so many Caprices,
and Follies of my own, that I can't possibly answer
for my Cousin's too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Well said, <hi>Bell.</hi></p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7" facs="13"/>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>Answer, Miss!—No, Heav'n forbid you should—
for my Part, I have given up all my Hopes as a
Lover, and only, now, feel for her as a Friend—
and indeed as a Friend, a sincere Friend—I can't but
say, that going out in a Hackney Chair, without a
Servant, and endeavouring to conceal herself, is somewhat
incompatible with Miss <hi>Sophy</hi>'s Rank and Reputation
—This I speak as a Friend—not as a
Lover, Miss <hi>Bell</hi>—pray mind that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>I see it very plainly, Mr. <hi>Tukely</hi>—and it gives
me great Pleasure, that you can be so indifferent in
your Love, and yet so jealous in your Friendship.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>You do me Honour, Miss, by your good Opinion.</p>
<stage>[Walks about, and sees <hi>Sophy.</hi></stage>
<p>Who's that, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>A Gentleman who is waiting for <hi>Sophy.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>I think she has Gentlemen waiting for her every
where.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>I am afraid, Sir, <stage>[coming up to him with her Glass]</stage>
you'll excuse me, that notwithstanding your Declaration,
and this Lady's Compliments, there is a little
of the Devil, call'd Jealousy, at the Bottom of all
this Uneasiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>Sir!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>I say, Sir, wear your Cloak as long as you
please, the Hoof will peep out, take my Word
for it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>Upon my Word, Sir, you are pleas'd to honour
me with a Familiarity which I neither expected, or
indeed desired, upon so slight an Acquaintance.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>I dare swear you did not.</p>
<stage>[Turns off, and hums a Tune.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>I don't understand this!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA:</speaker>
<p>This is beyond Expectation—</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>I presume, Sir, you never was out of <hi>England</hi>—</p>
<stage>[Picking her Teeth.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>I presume, Sir, that you are mistaken—
I never was so foolishly fond of my own Country,
to think that nothing good was to be had out of it;
nor so shamefully ungrateful to it, to prefer the
Vices and Fopperies of every other Nation, to the
peculiar Advantages of my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha; well said, old <hi>England,</hi> i'faith—Now,
Madam, if this Gentleman would put this Speech
into a Farce, and properly lard it with Roast Beef,
and Liberty, I wou'd engage the Galleries wou'd
roar and halloo at it for half an Hour together—
Ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Now the Storm's coming.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="15"/>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>If you are not engag'd, Sir, we'll adjourn to the
next Tavern, and write this Farce between us.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>I fancy, Sir, by the Information of your Face,
that you are more inclin'd to Tragedy, than Comedy—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>I shall be inclin'd to treat you very ill, if you
don't walk out with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>I have been treated so very ill already, in the little
Conversation I have had with you, that you must
excuse my walking out for more of it; but if you'll
persuade the Lady to leave the Room, I'll put you
to Death—Damme—</p>
<stage>[Going up to him.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>For Heaven's sake! what's the Matter, Gentlemen?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>What can I do with this Fellow?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Madam, don't be alarm'd—this Affair will
be very short—I am always expeditious; and will
cut his Throat, without shocking you in the least:
—Come, Sir, <stage>[draws]</stage> if you won't defend yourself,
I must kick you about the Room.</p>
<stage>[Advancing.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>Respect for this Lady, and this House, has curb'd
my Resentment hitherto: But as your Insolence
wou'd take Advantage of my Forbearance, I must
correct it at all Events—</p>
<stage>[Draws.</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA and ARABELLA.</speaker>

<p>'Tis in Obedience to your Commands—Thus

<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>Your Spirit transports me—This will be a busy,

no less than five Ladies to meet me at the

yourself, the accomplish'd Mr. <hi>Daffodil</hi> has presented
his Heart; the Value of which I am resolved

it, I'll write to him as from thence—But ask
me no more Questions about what I have done, and
what is to be done; for I have not a Moment to

<p>What a Couple of blind Fools has Love made of
this poor Fellow, and my dear Cousin <hi>Sophy?</hi> Little
do they imagine, with all their wise Discoveries, that
<hi>Daffodil</hi> is as faithful a Lover, as he is an accomplish'd
Gentleman—I pity these poor deceiv'd Women,
with all my Heart—But how will they stare,
when they find that he has artfully pretended a Regard
for them, the better to conceal his real Passion
<pb n="12" facs="18"/>
for me—They will certainly tear my Eyes out;
and what will Cousin <hi>Sophy</hi> say to me, when we are
oblig'd to declare our Passion? No Matter what—
'Tis the Fortune of War—And I shall only serve
her, as she and every other Friend wou'd serve me

<p>But are you sure, <hi>Ruffle,</hi> that you deliver'd the

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>Exactly, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>And you are sure that Mr. <hi>Dotterel</hi> saw you slip
the Note into his Wife's Hand?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>I have alarm'd him, and you may be assur'd, that
he is as uneasy as you wou'd wish to have him—But
I shou'd be glad, with your Honour's Leave, to have
a little serious Conversation with you; for my Mind
forebodes much Peril to the Bones of your humble
Servant, and very little Satisfaction to your Honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Thou art a most incomprehensible Blockhead—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>No great Scholar, or Wit, indeed—but I can feel
an Oak Sappling, as well as another—Ay, and I
shou'd have felt one last Night, if I had not had the

<p>No, thank Heaven—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>You was not kick'd then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Nor can'd?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFLLE.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir.</p>

<sp>

<p>O, Lord! No, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>That's unlucky—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>You must go again, <hi>Ruffle,</hi> to Night, perhaps you
may be in better Luck.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>If I go again, Sir, may I be can'd, kick'd, and
Horse-ponded for my Pains—I believe I have been
lucky enough to bring an old House over your
Head.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>What d'ye mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Dotterel</hi> only hobbled after me, to pay me
for the Postage of your Letter; but being a little out
of Wind, he soon stopt, to curse and swear at me—
<pb n="14" facs="20"/>
I cou'd hear him mutter something of Scoundrel,
and Pimp, and my Master, and Villain—and Blunderbuss,
and Saw-pit; and then he shook his Stick,
and look'd like the Devil!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Blunderbuss, and Saw-pit! This Business grows a
little serious, and so we will drop it—The Husband
is so old and peevish, and she so young and pressing,
that I'll give it up, <hi>Ruffle</hi>—The Town talks of us,
and I am satisfied.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>Pray Sir, with Submission, for what End do you
write to so many Ladies, and make such a Rout
about 'em; there are now upon the List half a Dozen
Maids, a Leash of Wives, and the Widow <hi>Damply.</hi>
I know your Honour don't intend Mischief; but
what Pleasure can you have in deceiving them, and
the World? for you are thought a terrible young
Gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Why that Pleasure, Booby.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>I don't understand it—What do you intend to do
with 'em all? Ruin 'em?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Not I, faith.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>But you'll ruin their Reputations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>That's their Business—Not mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>Will you marry any one of 'em?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>O, no; that wou'd be finishing the Game at
once—If I preferr'd one, the Rest wou'd take it
<pb n="15" facs="21"/>
ill; so because I won't be particular, I give 'em
all Hopes, without going a Step further.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>Widows can't live upon such slender Diet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>A true Sportsman has no Pleasure but in the
Chace; the Game is always given to those who have
less Taste, and better Stomachs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>I love to pick a Bit, I must confess—Really, Sir,
I shou'd not care what became of half the Women
you are pleas'd to be merry with—But Miss <hi>Sophy,</hi>
sure, is a heavenly Creature, and deserves better
Treatment; and to make Love to her Cousin too,
in the same House—that is very cruel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>But it amuses one—besides they are both fine
Creatures. And how do I know, if I lov'd only
one, but the other might poison herself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>RUFFLE.</speaker>
<p>And when they know that you have lov'd 'em
both, they may poison one another—This Affair
will make a great Noise.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Or I have taken a great Deal of Pains for nothing;
but no more prating, Sirrah; while I read
my Letters, go and ask <hi>Harry</hi> what Cards and Messages
he has taken in this Morning.</p>

<hi>Hurlothrumbo</hi> for the <hi>Roan Mare,</hi> and fifty Pounds.
Sir <hi>Roger</hi> has taken the Match off your Hands,
which is a good Thing; for the Mare has the
Distemper, and must have forfeited—I flung his

<p>Dear Ladies, be as merry with my Figure as you

have been.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>Why will you give yourself this unnecessary
Trouble, Mr. <hi>Tukely,</hi> to convince these Ladies, who
had rather still be deluded, and will hate your
Friendship for breaking the Charm.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>My dear Cousin, tho' you are satisfied, these Ladies
are not; and if they have their particular Reasons
for their Infidelity; pray, let 'em enjoy it, 'till
they have other Proofs than your Prejudices.</p>

<p>Ay, <hi>Bell,</hi> we have all our Prejudices.</p>

<p>What signifies reasoning, when we are going upon

<p>For my Part, if I was unmarried, I should not

<p>But as you are, Madam—</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Mrs. DOTTEREL.</speaker>
<p>I understand your Insinuations, Miss <hi>Bell</hi>; but my

<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>

<p>Hold, Sir, you must take no Liberties—But,
if you have the least Feeling for an unhappy Woman,
urg'd by her Passion to this imprudent Step,
assist me—forgive me—let me go.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Can you doubt my Honour? Can you doubt my
Love? What Assurances can I give you to abate
your Fears?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. DOTTEREL.</speaker>
<p>Very slender Ones, I can assure her.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>I deserve to suffer all I feel—For what, but
the most blinded Passion, cou'd induce me to declare
myself to one, whose Amours and Infidelities are
the common Topic of Conversation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Flattering Creature! <stage>[Aside.]</stage>—May I never
know your dear Name, see your charming Face,

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>I have not that Honour—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>I thought so—Did you never see her, Madam, nodling
and gogling in her Old-fashion'd heavy Chariot,
drawn by a pair of lean hackney Horses, with a fat
Blackamoor Footman behind, in a scanty Livery,
Red greasy Stockings, and a dirty Turban?</p>

<p>All which may be only a Foil to her Beauty.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Beauty! Don't sigh, Madam; she is past Forty,
wears a Wig, and has lost two of her fore Teeth.
—And then, she has so long a Beard upon her
upper Lip, and takes so much <hi>Spanish</hi> Snuff, that
she looks, for all the World, like the <hi>Great Mogul</hi>
in Petticoats; ha, ha,—</p>

<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Poor Mrs. <hi>Dotterel,</hi> you mean—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. DOTTEREL.</speaker>
<p>Why am I to be mentioned!—I have nothing

<p>Nay, nay; you must have your Share of the Panegyrick.</p>

<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>She is young, and has Wit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>She's an Ideot, Madam; and as Fools are generally
loving, she has forgot all her Obligations to
old Mr. <hi>Dotterel,</hi> who married her without a Petticoat;
and now seizes upon every young Fellow she
can lay her Hands upon; she has spoil'd me three
Suits of Cloaths, with tearing the Flaps and Sleeves.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. DOTTEREL.</speaker>
<p>Monster of Iniquity!—</p>

<p>She has even storm'd me in my own House; but
with all my Faults, Madam, you'll never find me

<p>Fond Creature! <stage>[Aside.]</stage> I know there are a thousand

Lady <hi>Fanny Pewit,</hi> I suppose? Don't be alarm'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I can't help it, Sir. She is a fine Woman, and
Woman of Quality.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="46" facs="52"/>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>A fine Woman, perhaps, for a Woman of Quality
—but she is an absolute old Maid, Madam, almost
as thick as she is long—middle-aged, homely
and wanton! That's her Character.</p>

her Footman.—Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lady PEWIT.</speaker>
<p>My Footman shall break his Bones, I can tell
him that.</p>
</sp>

<p>So, so, <stage>[Aside.]</stage> I know him a little.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>I am sorry for it—The less you know of him
the better; the Fellow pretended to look fierce at
me, for which I resolv'd to have his Mistress: So
I threw in my Line, and without much Trouble,
hook'd her. Her poor Cousin too, nibbled at the
Bait, and was caught.—So I have had my Revenge
upon <hi>Tukely,</hi> and now I shall willingly resign
poor <hi>Sophy,</hi> and throw him in her Cousin, for a Make-Weight.

<p>Who are you then?—And what are you doing
with that Blackamoor Lady there—dancing a Saraband
with a Pair of Castanets? Speak, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Pray forbear, Sir; here's Company coming that
will satisfie you in every Thing—Hallo, hallo—
<pb n="50" facs="56"/>
Here, here, here; <stage>[Hallo's faintly]</stage> my Lord, my
my Lord—<hi>Spinner, Dizzy</hi>—Hallo!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Lord RACKET, Sir TAN-TIVY, SPINNER,
and DIZZY, with Torches.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RACKET.</speaker>
<p>What's the Matter here?—Who calls for Help?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Running to 'em with his Sword drawn]</stage> O, my
Friends, I have been wishing for you this half Hour.
I have been set upon by a dozen Fellows—They
have all made their Escape, but this—My Arm is
quite dead—I have been at Cart and Tierce with
'em all, for near a Quarter of an Hour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
<p>In Buckram, my Lord!—He was got with my
Property here, and I wou'd have chastis'd him for
it, if your Coming had not prevented it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Let us throw the Rascal into <hi>Rosamond</hi>'s Pond.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RACKET.</speaker>
<p>Come Sir, can you swim?</p>
<stage>[All going up. TUKELY snatches SOPHIA's
Sword, and she runs behind him.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>I'll defend you, my Dear—What, wou'd you
murder a Man, and lie with his Wife too?—Oh!
you are a wicked Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Daffodil.</hi></p>
<stage>[Attacks DAFF.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Why, the Devil's in the Woman, I think.</p>
<stage>[All the Ladies advance from behind.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADIES.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! your humble Servant, Mr. <hi>Daffodil</hi>—
Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>This is all Enchantment!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady PEWIT.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, the Enchantment is broke—and the
old Maid, Sir, homely and wanton, before she
retires into the Country, has the Satisfaction of
knowing that the agreeable Mr. <hi>Daffodil</hi> is a much
more contemptible Mortal, than the Footman which
his Goodness has been pleas'd to marry her to.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADIES.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Widow DAMPLY.</speaker>
<p>Wou'd Mr. <hi>Daffodil</hi> please to have a Pinch of
<hi>Spanish</hi> Snuff, out of the <hi>Great Mogul</hi>'s Box? 'Tis
the best Thing in the World for low Spirits.</p>
<stage>[Offers her Box.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LADIES.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. DOTTEREL.</speaker>
<p>If a Fool may not be permitted to speak, Mr.
<hi>Daffodil,</hi> let her at least be permitted to laugh at so
fine a Gentleman—Ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARABELLA.</speaker>
<p>Were you as sensible of Shame, as you are of Fear,
the Sight of me, whom you lov'd for Pity, wou'd
be Revenge sufficient—But I can forgive your Baseness
to me, much easier than I can myself, for my
Behaviour to this happy Couple.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Who the Devil are they?</p>

I shall wish never to wake again.</p>

<p>Who bids fairest now for <hi>Rosamond</hi>'s Pond?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="52" facs="58"/>
<speaker>Lord RACKET.</speaker>
<p>What, in the Name of Wonder, is all this Business?
I don't understand it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DIZZY.</speaker>
<p>Nor I neither; but 'tis very drole, faith.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>The Mystery will clear in a Moment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DAFFODIL.</speaker>
<p>Don't give yourself any Trouble, Mr. <hi>Tukely,</hi>
Things are pretty clear as they are—The Night's
cool, and my Cousin <hi>Dizzy,</hi> here, is an Invalid—
If you please, another Time, when there is less Company,
<stage>[Ladies laugh]—</stage> The Ladies are pleas'd to be
merry, and you are pleas'd to be a little angry; and
so, for the Sake of Tranquility—I'll go to the Opera.</p>
<stage>[DAFF. sneaking out by Degrees.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord RACKET.</speaker>
<p>This is a fine blow-up, indeed! Ladies, your
humble Servant—Hallo! <hi>Daffodil.</hi></p>
<stage>[Exit Lord RACK.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DIZZY.</speaker>
<p>I'll lay you a Hundred, that my Cousin never intrigues
again—<hi>George! George!</hi> Don't run—hugh,
hugh—</p>
<stage>[Exit DIZ.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TUKELY.</speaker>
<p>As my Satisfaction is compleat, I have none to ask
of Mr. <hi>Daffodil.</hi> I forgive his Behaviour to me, as it
has hasten'd and confirm'd my Happiness here; <stage>[to
<hi>Sophia.</hi>]—</stage> But as a Friend to you, Ladies, I shall insist
upon his making you ample Satisfaction—However,
this Benefit will arise, that you will hereafter equally
detest and shun these Destroyers of your Reputation—</p>
<l>In <hi>You</hi> Coquettry is a Loss of Fame;</l>
<l>But in <hi>Our</hi> Sex, 'tis that detested Name,</l>
<l>That marks the Want of Manhood, Virtue, Sense,
and Shame.</l>
