<head>PREFACE</head>
<p>THERE is, perhaps, nothing more uninteresting than the generality of those preliminary discourses, in which Authors too frequently lay out much of their time in talking of themselves and their works. The importance of a Man to himself is fully displayed, while the Reader yawns over the tedious page, or laughs at the rhetoric, that would persuade him he ought to be pleased. The present Writer has been unwilling, upon almost all occasions, to conform to a practice which he saw attended with so little success: But the following Tragedy is sent into the worla in a manner that may require some explanation. It has not gone through the siery trial of the Theatre; nor is it recommended by the favourable decision of an Audience. The pomp of splendid scenery, and the illusions of the skilful performer, have not awakened the public attention:—The Play ventures abroad, without having previously gained, by the advantages of representation, a character, which in the leisure of the closet is not always supported. But this circumstance, while it raises no expectation, may, on the other hand, excite a prejudice not casy to be sarmounted. If it be of any value, why was it not produced in the usual form of a Public Exhibition? The reasons that influenced the Author, would lead to a long and frivolous detail. Whatever those reasons were, whether caprice, whim, peevishness, or delicacy, they were of weight to determine his conduct. His work, however, does not go forth with accusations of any kind against the Proprietors of either Theatre: it makes no appeal from their judgment. The fact is, it never was in their hands; and where there was no refusal, there can be no room for complaint.</p>
<p>It need not be dissambled, that the Play was written with a view to the Stage. It was begun and finished in the Summer 1783, at a time when the Author was disabled, by a nervous disorder in
<pb n="iv" facs="3"/>
his eyes, from pursuing a more important work, which has engaged several years of his life. It was painful to read, and he found amusement necessary. He walked in green fields, made verses, and threw them upon paper in characters almost illegible. For a subject, he was not long at a less. He remembered that Madame <hi>de Sévigné</hi> <note n="*" place="foot">Vide her Letter 1st April, 1672.</note> mentions her having attended the representation of ARIANE, a Tragedy by the younger <hi>Corneille.</hi> The play, says that amiable Writer, though in its general style and conduct flat and insipid; was, notwithstanding, followed by all Paris, not for the sake of the poetry, but the Actress, <hi>La Champmélé,</hi> whom she calls the greatest prodigy the Stage ever beheld. The others were disgusting; but when the <hi>Champmélé</hi> entered the scene, a murmur of applause ran through the Theatre; every heart was interested, and every eye dissolved in tears.</p>
<p>WHEN this country could, with pride, boast of an Actress equally followed, and perhaps with better reason; it occurred that a Tragedy, with the beauties of the original, but freed from it's defects, might, at such a season, be acceptable to the Public. The defects, which drew down the judgment of so enlightened a Critic as Madame <hi>de Sévigné,</hi> are pointed out with minute exactress, by the judicious <hi>Voltaire.</hi> <note n="†" place="foot">See his Edition of Corseille's Works.</note> From that pleasing Writer we learn, that the Tragedy in question still keeps it's rank upon the Stage, whenever an Actress of eminence wishes for an opportunity to display her talents in a principal character. The situation he observes, is interesting and pathetic: "A princess, who has done every thing for her hero; who has delivered him from a cruel death, and sacrificed all considerations for his sake; who loves him generously; who thinks herself loved in return, and deserves to be so; who finds herself, at last, abandoned by the Man whom she adores, and betrayed by a Sister whom she also loved: 'A woman thus situated,' says I <hi>Voltaire,</hi> 'forms the happiest subject that has come down to as from antiquity.' Notwithstanding this general account, <hi>Voltaire's</hi> observations, which trace the Author scene by scene, show that Madame <hi>de Sévigné</hi> was not mistaken in her judgment.</p>
<p><pb n="v" facs="4"/>SHALL the present Writer flatter himself that he has removed the vices of the first concoction, and substituted what is better? He has certainly endeavoured to do it. For this purpose a New Fable was necessary. The progress of the business required to be conducted in a different manner, with more rapidity, and without those languid scenes which weaken the interest, and too often border upon the dialogue of Comedy. The characters were to be cast in a new mould; and instead of definitions of the passions, their conflict, their vehemence, and their various transitions, were to be painted forth in higher colouring, than are to be found in the French composition. The Reader, therefore, is not to expect a mere translation. The Author does not scruple to say that he entered into a competition with the original; that he has aimed at a better Tragedy; and to use the words of a late elegant Writer, <hi>he hopes he has shown some invention, though he has built upon another man's ground.</hi></p>
<p>BUT here again the question recurs, if the new superstructure raised upon the old foundation has any merit, why not produce it with all the advantage of that celebrated Actress, who, it seems inspired the first design? The plain truth shall be the answer: When the piece was finished, the Author had his moments of self-approbation, and in his first ardour, hinted to a friend, that he intended to give it to the Stage. But self-approbation did not last long:—That glow of imagination, which (to speak the truth) is sometimes heated into a pleasing delirium with its own work, subsided by degrees, and doubt and diffidence succeeded. A Play, that might linger nine nights upon the Stage, was not the object of the Author's ambition; Whether he has been able to execute any thing better, he has not considered for a long time, nor has he now courage to determine. He has often said to himself, in the words of TULLY, <hi>Nihil hue, nisi perfectum ingenio, Elaboratum Industriâ, afferri oportere;</hi> and after adopting, in his own case, so rigid a rule, how shall he presume to say, that the production of a summer can boast either of genius, or the elaborate touches of industry?</p>
<p>IN this irresolute state of mind, the Author's respect for the Public, who have done him, upon former occasions, very particular
<pb n="vi" facs="5"/>
honour, increased his t'midity: he was unwilling to appear a candidate for their favour, when he was not sure of adding to their pleasure. At present, being to give an edition of such pieces, as he has been able to produce, he could not think of keeping back the only dramatic work left upon his hands. He, therefore, sends it into the world an humble adventurer: with one of, his predecessors, he says, '<hi>Va mon Enfant; prens ta Fortune.'</hi> The Play amused him while he was engaged in the writing of it, and should the candid Reader find an hour of leisure not entirely thrown away in the perusal, the Author will not think his time altogether mis-employed. He now dismisses the Piece, if not with indifference, at least with resignation; content to leave the honours of the Theatre to Writers of more ambition than he possesses at present.</p>

<sp>

<l>AWAY! no more!—why thus pursue my steps?</l>
<l>Begone and leave me; leave me to my woes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>Yet, Phaedra, be advis'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phae.</speaker>
<l>Presume no further.</l>
<l>Advis'd by thee! no,—let your pliant king,</l>
<l>Your king of Naxos, to thy treach'rous counsels</l>
<l>Resign himself, his people, and his laws.</l>
<l>Thou hast undone us all; by thee we die;</l>
<l>Yes, Ariadne, Phaedra, Theseus, all,</l>
<l>All die by thee!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>Princess, your fears are groundless.</l>
<l>Your timorous fancy forms unjust suspicions.</l>
<l>If you but knew me—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phae.</speaker>
<l>O, too well I know thee!</l>
<l>This very morn 'tis fix'd; yes, here your king</l>
<l>Gives audience to th' Ambassador of Crete;</l>
<l>Here in this palace; here, by your persuasion,</l>
<l>He means to yield us to the rage of Minos,</l>
<l>To my vindictive father's stern demand.</l>
<l>Ere that I'll see your king; here wait his coming.</l>
<l>And counteract thy base ungen'rous counsel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>This storm of passion bears your reason down.</l>
<l>Let prudence guide thee. In a night like this,</l>
<l>Why quit your couch, and to the whirlwind's rage,</l>
<l>The vollied lightening, and the war of nature,</l>
<l>Why wilt thou thus commit thy tender frame?—</l>
<stage>Thunder and lightning.</stage>
<l><pb n="10" facs="8"/>Again that dreadful peal!—"All-gracious Powers!</l>
<l>"What crime provokes your wrath? must this fair island,</l>
<l>"That long hath flourish'd in th' Aegean deep,</l>
<l>"Must Naxos with her sons, a blameless race,</l>
<l>"Burn to the centre, and the brawling waves</l>
<l>"Close o'er the wreck for ever?</l>
</sp>
<stage>Another clap of thunder.</stage>

<speaker>"<hi>Phae.</hi></speaker>
<l>Oh, that burst</l>

<sp>
<speaker>"<hi>Arc.</hi></speaker>
<l>Thus through the night</l>
<l>"Hath the wild uproar shook the groaning isle.</l>
<l>"Fierce rain and liquid fire in mingled torrents</l>
<l>"Came rushing o'er the land. The wrath of Heaven</l>
<l>"Rides in the tempest. Towers and sacred domes</l>
<l>"Fell in promiscuous ruin. Ships were dash'd,</l>
<l>"On pointed rocks, or swallowed in the deep.</l>
<l>"Destruction rages round:" amidst the roar,</l>
<l>When all things else, when ev'n the fiercest natures</l>
<l>Shrink from the hideous ruin, you alone</l>
<l>Walk through the storm, with fierce, with hagard mien,</l>
<l>A form that suits the dreadful wild commotion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phae.</speaker>
<l>Yes, with a heart, in which the storm that rages,</l>
<l>Surpasses all the horrors of the night.</l>
<l>"Yes, here I come supreme in misery.</l>
<l>"I only wake to cares unknown to him</l>
<l>"Who treads secure the paths of humble life,</l>
<l>"And thanks the gods for his obscure retreat,</l>
<l>"For the blest shade in which their bounty plac'd him."</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phae.</speaker>
<l>'Tis you have rais'd this tempest of the soul.</l>
<l>You, sir, are minister; you govern here,</l>
<l>And bend at will an unsuspecting monarch.</l>
<l>To thee he yields his oracie of state;</l>
<l>And when with wrongs you have oppress'd mankind,</l>
<l>'Tis the king's pleasure; 'tis the royal will.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>Unjust, ungenerous charge! have you forgot,</l>
<l>When first your vessel reach'd the coast of Naxos?</l>
<l>You sued for leave to land upon the isle:</l>
<l>To pray for shelter here. Ere that we heard</l>
<l>Theseus was with you: Theseus, whom the state</l>
<l>Of Athens sent a sacrifice to Minos,</l>
<l>A victim to absolve the annual tribute,</l>
<l>Impos'd by conquest: Ariadne's love,</l>
<l>Her generous efforts to redeem the hero,</l>
<l>Ev'n then were known at Periander's court.</l>
<l>The wond'rous story on the wings of Fame</l>
<l><pb n="11" facs="9"/>Had reach'd our Isle; she pity'd, and she lov'd him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phae.</speaker>
<l>She lov'd him—Yes, she saw, and she ador'd.</l>
<l>Gods! who could see the graces of his youth,</l>
<l>His cause, his innocence, the hero's mien,</l>
<l>Manly and firm, yet soften'd by distress,</l>
<l>Gods! who could see him, and not gaze entranc'd</l>
<l>In ecstacy and love?—What have I said?</l>
<l>My warmth too far transports me—ah! beware</l>
<stage>Aside.</stage>
<l>'Twas as you say; she pity'd, and she lov'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>She favour'd his escape: you fled together.</l>
<l>To ev'ry neighb'ring isle you wing'd your flight.</l>
<l>You visited each realm; with prayers and tears</l>
<l>Wearied each court. All fear'd your father's power.</l>
<l>You came to Naxos; Periander's will,</l>
<l>Your orator, came forth. Did not I then—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phae.</speaker>
<l>You succour'd our distress:the tear of sympathy</l>
<l>Stood in your eye; and you may boast your merit—</l>
<l>You play'd it well, sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>This ambiguous strain</l>
<l>But ill requites the offices of friendship;</l>
<l>For you I watch'd the temper of the king,</l>
<l>His ebbs and flows of passion: in apt season</l>
<l>You landed here. Thrice hath the waning moon</l>
<l>Conceal'd her light, and thrice renew'd her orb,</l>
<l>While you, meantime, have liv'd protected here.</l>
<l>Each hour has seen your sister Ariadne</l>
<l>Rise in her charms; and now with boundless sway</l>
<l>She reigns supreme in Periander's heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phae.</speaker>
<l>True, we have found protection from your king.</l>
<l>Three months have pass'd—but in that time a statesman.</l>
<l>May change his mind. New views of interest—</l>
<l>New plans of policy, fair seeming motives,</l>
<l>May give new principles.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>It is my first.</l>
<l>My best ambition to relieve the wretched.</l>
<l>You wrong me, princess; you had best retire.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phae.</speaker>
<l>No; Periander first shall hear my suit.</l>
<l>Here will I wait his coming; on the earth</l>
<l>Fall prostrate at his fect, implore his mercy.</l>
<l>Cling round his knees; and never loose my hold.</l>
<l>Till his heart melt, and save us from destruction.</l>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> THESEUS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>The.</speaker>
<l>What plaintive sorrow thro' the lonely palace</l>
<l>Alarms my lift'ning ear?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="10"/>
<speaker>Phae.</speaker>
<l>That well-known voice</l>
<l>Dispels my fears. O! Theseus, how my heart</l>
<l>Bounds at thy lov'd approach! and yet this day</l>
<l>Decides your doom.—Archon can tell you all.</l>
<l>This day resigns you to my father's power.</l>
<l>Here Periander has resolv'd to answer</l>
<l>Th' ambassador of Crete.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>The.</speaker>
<l>Controul thy fears.</l>
<l>Archon has serv'd me, and I thank him for it.</l>
<l>All will be well; the king protects us still.</l>
<l>Archon, the storm that threaten'd hideous ruin</l>
<l>At length subsides. The angry blast recalls</l>
<l>Its train of horrors. Through the sev'ring clouds</l>
<l>Faint gleams of day disclose the face of things.</l>
<l>The raging deep, that rose in mountain billows,</l>
<l>Sinks to repose: The winds, the waves are hush'd.</l>
<l>From yon high tower, that overhangs the bay,</l>
<l>I view'd the ocean round. No sail appears,</l>
<l>No vessel cleaves the deep, save one escap'd</l>
<l>From the wild uproar of the warring winds;</l>
<l>That with it's shatter'd masts, and lab'ring oars,</l>
<l>Stems the rough tide, and enters now the harbour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Phae.</speaker>
<l>Another sail! and enters now the harbour!</l>
<l>From whence? Who and what are they? From what coast?</l>
<l>Alas, from Crete! 'tis Minos sends; my father's wrath</l>
<l>Pursues us still; another embassy</l>
<l>Comes to demand us all,</l>
<l>And banish ev'ry fear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Arc.</speaker>
<l>Perhaps some vessel</l>
<l>Rich with the stores, with busy commerce sends</l>
<l>From the adjacent isles, on Naxos' coast</l>
<l>Now seeks a shelter from the roaring deep—</l>
<l>I'll to the harbour. Theseus, be it thine</l>
<l>To pour o'er Phaedra's wees the balm of comfort,</l>
<l>And hush her cares to peace. From Crete, I trust,</l>
<l>The messengers of woe no more will come,</l>
<l>To urge their stern demand.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>

<speaker>Phae.</speaker>
<l>He seems a friend, the surer to betray.</l>
<l>Full well he knows that Ariadne's charms.</l>
<l>Have wak'd a flame in Periander's heart.</l>
<l>To that alliance with a statesman's craft</l>
<l>He stands a foe conceal'd: He dre ds to see</l>
<l><pb n="13" facs="11"/>On Naxos' throne a queen from Minos sprung,</l>
<l>And therefore plans our ruin.</l>

<l>"At shadowy forms. Were thy suspicions just,</l>
<l>"Wherefore reveal them? Why unguard thyself,</l>
<l>"And lay each secret open to your foe?</l>
<l>"With him, whose rankling malice works unseen,</l>
<l>"While smiles becalm his looks, 'twere best pretend</l>
<l>"Not to perceive the lurking treachery—</l>
<l>"Reproof but goads him, and new whets his passions;</l>
<l>"Till what was policy becomes revenge—</l>
<l>"Detected villany can ne'er forgive.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>"<hi>Phae.</hi></speaker>
<l>And must I fall in silence? must we perish,</l>
<l>"Abandon'd by ourselves, tame, willing victims;</l>
<l>"Nor let the murd'rer hear one dying groan?</l>
<l>"Must I behold him with his treach'rous arts,</l>
<l>"A lurking foe, nor pour my curses on him;</l>
<l>"But poorly crouch, and thank him for the blow?</l>
<l>"Oh! love like mine, the love which you inspired,</l>

<l>He is; I know him well; he means destruction.</l>
<l>Th' ambassador of Crete will soon have audience.</l>
<l>Archon concerted all. Oh! if my care</l>
<l>Could counteract his dark, his sell designs,</l>
<l>Then were I bless'd indeed. When first you landed</l>
<l>A helpless victim on the Cretan shore;</l>
<l>Full well you know, soft pity touch'd my heart,</l>
<l>And soon, that tender pity chang'd to love.</l>
<l>I wish'd to save you: Ariadne's fortune</l>
<l>Gave her the clue that led you thro' the maze.</l>
<l>Her zeal out-ran my speed, but not my love.</l>
<l>And would my fate allow me now to save thee,</l>
<l>Then by that tie ('tis all my sister's claim)</l>
<l>I then should prove me worthy of thy love.</l>

<l>As not to feel with transport at my heart</l>
<l>Thy powerful charms. To Ariadne</l>
<l>I owe my life. That boon demands respect,</l>
<l>Demands my gratitude: But love must spring</l>

<l>Last night when ev'ry care was lull'd to res't,</l>
<l>No eye to trace my steps, no conscious ear</l>
<l>To catch the sound, then Periander granted</l>
<l>A private conference: I unbosom'd to him,</l>
<l>In confidence, the secrets; of my heart.</l>
<l>To Ariadne I resign'd all claim;</l>
<l>Renounc'd each tender passion. Periander</l>
<l>No longer view'd me with a rival's eye.</l>
<l>He promis'd his protection. Ariadne</l>
<l>Has pow'rful charms, and the king bears a heart</l>
<l>To beauty not impassive. Joy and rapture</l>
<l>Spoke in his eye, and purpled o'er his face.</l>
<l>With vanity she'll hear a monarch's sighs,</l>
<l>Proud of her sway. A diadem will quench</l>
<l>Her former flame, with glitt'ring splendor tempt her,</l>
<l>And make the infidelity her own.</l>

<l>That dang'rous secret I have skreen'd with care.</l>
<l>Here it lies buried. Periander thinks</l>
<l>A former flame, kindled long since in Greece,</l>
<l>Preys on my heart with slow consuming fires.</l>

<l>In fairest terms</l>
<l>Of friendly greeting Minos, sir, by me</l>
<l>Imparts his rightful claim. He knows the justice,</l>
<l>The moderation that directs your counsels:</l>
<l>He knows, though oft' in the embattled field</l>
<l>Your sword has reek'd with blood, your wisdom still</l>
<l>Respects the rights of kings; respects the laws,</l>
<l>That hold the nations in the bonds of peace.</l>
<l>To you, sir, he appeals; he claims his daughters,</l>
<l>His rebel daughters, leagu'd against his crown:</l>
<l>He claims the victim from his vengeance rescued;</l>
<l>Rescued by fraud, by Ariadne's fraud;</l>
<l>And here at Naxos shelter'd from his justice.</l>
<l>A sov'reign and a parent claims his rights.</l>
<l>You will respect the father and the king.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Perian.</speaker>
<l>Of Minos' virtues, his renown in arms,</l>
<l>His plan of laws, that spread around the blessings</l>
<l>Of sacred order, and of social life;</l>
<l>Laws, which even kings obey, the world has heard</l>
<l>With praise, with gratitude. All must revere</l>
<l>The legislator, and the friend of man:</l>
<l>But in the sorrows that distract his house,</l>
<l>Is it for me with rash mistaken zeal</l>

<l>To judge his daughter's conduct? What decree,</l>
<l><pb n="17" facs="15"/>What law of mine, what policy of Naxos</l>
<l>Have they offended? All who roam the deep</l>
<l>Find in my ports a safe, a sure retreat.</l>
<l>Should I comply with your proud, bold request,</l>
<l>The hardy genius of this sea-girt isle</l>
<l>Would call it tyranny, and power usurp'd;</l>
<l>'Tis law, and not the sov'reign's will, that here</l>
<l>Controuls, directs, and animates the state</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Al.</speaker>
<l>The law that favours wrongs, and shelters guilt,</l>
<l>Subverts all order. Through her hundred cities</l>
<l>All Crete will mourn your answer. With regret</l>
<l>Minos will hear it. By pacific means</l>
<l>He would prevail; by justice, not the sword.</l>
<l>But, Sir, if justice, if a righteous cause</l>
<l>At your tribunal list their voice in vain,</l>
<l>I see the gath'ring storm; I see the dangers</l>
<l>That hover round your isle, and o'er the scene</l>
<l>Humanity lets fall the natural tear;</l>
<l>The sons of Crete, a brave, a gen'rous race,</l>

<l>If the protecting gods from Theseus' head</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>In vain I ask it. "Though his name delights</l>
<l>"My list'ning ear, yet you will never charm me</l>
<l>"With the lov'd praises of the godlike man."</l>
<l>On Periander's name you often dwell,</l>

<l>That sparkled in thy eye, or dawn'd in mine,</l>

<l>No, all Greece</l>

<l>By me demands your liberty. In terms</l>
<l>Of earnest import I have urg'd their claim;</l>
<l>But Periander,—to his ardent spirit</l>
<l>You are no stranger.—He no sooner heard</l>
<l>The name of Ariadne, than with fiercest rage—</l>
<l>Perhaps you know the cause—with high disdain</l>
<l>He spurn'd at the demand. Some hidden motive—</l>
<l>'Tis love perhaps—you will forgive my boldness—</l>
<l>'Tis love, perhaps, that prompts the stern reply</l>
<l>Should I presume once more to urge the claim,</l>
<l><pb n="32" facs="30"/>Theseus that moment must embark for Crete.</l>
<l>So says the king: he will not brook a rival.</l>
<l>You'll see you lover torn by russians from you;</l>
<l>You'll see the ship bound swiftly o'er the waves;</l>
<l>In vain you'll shriek; in vain extend your arms,</l>
<l>And call on Theseus lost!</l>

<sp>
<speaker>"<hi>The.</hi></speaker>
<l>Too soon that scene, with low'ring clouds deform'd,</l>
<l>"Will show the sad reverse." You little know</l>
<l>How Periander with resistless fury</l>
<l>Breaks through all bounds. His passions scorn restraint.</l>
<l>And what he wills, his vehemence of soul</l>
<l>Pursues with fierce, with unremitting ardour.</l>
<l>To his wild fury all must yield obedience.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>Ari.</speaker>
<l>His reign has ever been both mild and just.</l>

<l>Yet there is an impulse,</l>
<l>Which with the whirlwind's unresisted rage,</l>
<l>Roots up each virtue, and lays waste the soul.</l>
<l>Love reigns a lawless tyrant in his heart.</l>
<l>For thee he sighs; and sure that matchless beauty</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ari.</speaker>
<l>Too well he knows the ties that bind us both.</l>
<l>Knows you're all truth, all constancy and love.</l>
<l>He knows the flame my virgin sighs have own'd;</l>
<l>Knows that for thee I left my native land,</l>
<l>Fled from my friends, and from my father's palace,</l>
<l>And gave up all for thee. And thinks he now</l>
<l>His throne, his diadem, his purple pomp,</l>
<l>Have charms of power to lure me from thy arms?</l>
<l>He knows his vows are lost in air: Thy heart</l>
<l>Is Ariadne's throne.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>The.</speaker>
<l>"His fiercest passions</l>
<l>"Break forth at once, like the deep cavern'd fire.</l>

<l>His jealous rage sends me hence bound in chains,</l>
<l>To die a victim on the Cretan shore.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ari.</speaker>
<l>He will not dare it; no, so black an outrage</l>
<l>His heart will ne'er conceive. Should he persist,</l>
<l>Should malice goad him on. I too can fly</l>
<l>This barb'rous shore; with unextinguish'd love</l>
<l>Through every region, every clime attend thee;</l>
<l>Follow your fortunes, if the fates ordain it,</l>
<l>Ev'n to my father's court; there prostrate fall.</l>
<l>And clasp his hand, and bathe it with my tears.</l>
<l>Nor cease with vehemence of grief to melt him,</l>
<l>Till he release thee to these circling arms,</l>
<l>"Approve my choice, and show thee to the people,</l>
<l>"The adopted heir, the rising sun of Crete."</l>

<l>Scarce, scarce perceiv'd! 'tis gone, 'tis lost,</l>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>WRITTEN BY I. P. KEMBLE. Spoken by Mr. WROUGHTON.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>WHENE'ER the Poet, in retiring vein,</l>
<l>Proclaims his purpose ne'er to write again,</l>
<l>The threaten'd Town interprets the kind way,</l>
<l>And takes an interest in his next last play.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Not that our Bard has play'd you fast and loose.</l>
<l>Or pleads this general candour for excuse;</l>
<l>He dares not trifle with the public sense,</l>
<l>But thinks such folly downright impudence;</l>
<l>Brought, not advancing, since he then appears,</l>
<l>To risk the well won fame of forty years,</l>
<l>He trusts distinct indulgence you' ll afford—</l>
<l>Not he, but Ariadne, breaks his word.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>From ancient stores we take our plot to-night,</l>
<l>Form'd on the mournful tale of Theseus' flight;</l>
<l>The time, that golden Aera, some relate,</l>
<l>When equal Minos rul'd the Cretan state.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Hail, holy Sage! who taught'st licentious man</l>
<l>To find his freedom where the laws began;</l>
<l>Whose fame in arms, redoubted from afar,</l>
<l>From thine own shores deter'd invasive war—</l>
<l>Whilst thy mild genius o'er a prosperous isle</l>
<l>Gave every good and every grace to smile;</l>
<l>'Till thine to all thy subjects were as dear,</l>
<l>As George's virtues to his Britons here.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>To all our author bids me humbly bend,</l>
<l>But deprecate no foe, end court no friend:</l>
<l>With grateful pride he thinks of honors past,</l>
<l>And hopes you 'll bid those valu'd honors last.</l>
<l>Freely to you he now commends his cause—</l>
<l>Should he deserve—you'll not withhold applause.</l>
</lg>

<pb facs="69"/>
<head>EPILOGUE</head>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>LADIES—though scarce alive—quite out of breath,</l>
<l>I come—to talk a little after death;</l>
<l>When tir'd of woe, and daggers, and all that,</l>
<l>Nothing revives us like a little chat.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now—so the laws of Epilogue ordain,</l>
<l>All should be turn'd to jest, and flippant strain;</l>
<l>And I, with points most miserably witty,</l>
<l>Should play the mimic, and lampoon the city.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Far other motives bid me now appear;</l>
<l>Far other sentiments are struggling here:</l>
<l>I come to view this circle, fair and bright,</l>
<l>And thank you for each tear you've shed to-night;</l>
<l>The tear, that gives the soft endearing grace;</l>
<l>Virtues cosmetic for the loveliest face;</l>
<l>That shows the features in their genuine hue,</l>
<l>Like roses blushing through the morning dew.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Ye men, —ye boasted lords of the creation,</l>
<l>Who give your Ariadnes such vexation;</l>
<l>May I approach you, pray? and may I dare</l>
<l>Ask why you droop?—and why that languid air?</l>
<l>'Tis sympathy in guilt; and Theseus' case</l>
<l>With rising blushes crimsons ev'ry face;</l>
<l>Ceusure on fraud like his, you own, must fall:</l>
<l>Too well you know—he represents you all.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And yet you've same excuse; these modish days</l>
<l>Lend a few tints to varnish all your ways.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="70"/>
<l>When a <hi>GRAND SWEEPSTAKES</hi> to Newmarket calls.</l>
<l>And <hi>FIVE TO FOUR</hi> each groom, each jockey bawls:</l>
<l>What beauty then can lure you from the course,</l>
<l>And hope—you'll love her <hi>BETTER</hi> than year <hi>HORSE?</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>When to the Club the gaming rage invites,</l>
<l>And fascinating <hi>FARO</hi> claims your nights;</l>
<l>The tender passion then intrudes no more,</l>
<l>And <hi>FORTUNE</hi> is the <hi>VENUS</hi> you adore.</l>
<l>But is she constant?—Loss on loss ensues,</l>
<l>And bonds, and mortgages, attorneys, Jews:</l>
<l>Love then may well his softer rights forego,</l>
<l>Spread his light wings, and fly the scene of woe.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But now the times a nobler plea may yield;</l>
<l>A War invites you;—arm, and take the field.</l>
<l>The <hi>SONS OF FRANCE</hi> would fain subvert your laws;</l>
<l>Go forth the champions of your country's cause.</l>
<l>Behold the bright example of the day,</l>
<l>Go—where our <hi>ROYAL FREDERICK</hi> leads the way;</l>
<l>So Albion's liberties secure shall stand,</l>
<l>And <hi>KING,</hi> and <hi>LORDS,</hi> and <hi>COMMONS</hi> guard the land.</l>
