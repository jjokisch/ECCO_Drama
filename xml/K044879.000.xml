<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by Mr. CUMBERLAND.</byline>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. REDDISH.</stage>
<lg>
<l>IN classic times, as learned authors say,</l>
<l>When <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> wits produc'd a play,</l>
<l>The herald <hi>Prologue,</hi> 'ere the sports began,</l>
<l>Fairly stept forward, and announc'd the plan:</l>
<l>In few plain words he ran the fable through,</l>
<l>And, without favour, publish'd all he knew.</l>
<l>An honest custom: for the plan was clear,</l>
<l>The scene was simple, and the Muse sincere;</l>
<l>No tawdry fashions warp'd the public taste,</l>
<l>The times were candid, and the stage was chaste.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Can we expect, in these enlighten'd days,</l>
<l>A courtly age should hold such vulgar ways?</l>
<l>Or that a blabbing prologue should disclose</l>
<l>Scenes, which no Muse of fashion ever shows.</l>
<l>No, Sirs,<hi>—Sethona is the lady's name—</hi></l>
<l><hi>She lives at Memphis—of unsullied fame:</hi></l>
<l><hi>A Tyrant woo'd her—but she lik'd another,</hi></l>
<l><hi>And once 'twas fear'd her lover was her brother.</hi></l>
<l>As for the rest, a little patience borrow,</l>
<l>The <hi>Chronicle</hi> will tell you all to-morrow.</l>
<l>Authors are now so over modest grown,</l>
<l>They publish all men's writings, but their own.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But let no living bard conceive offence,</l>
<l>Nor take the general in a partial sense.</l>
<l>Peace to all such! the lab'ring bee must feed</l>
<l>From flow'r to flow'r; perchance from weed to weed;</l>
<l>And should the comb unwelcome flavour yield,</l>
<l>The fault's not in the fabric, but the field;</l>
<l><pb facs="3"/>
The critic wasp, mean while upon the wing,</l>
<l>(An insect fraught with nothing but a sting)</l>
<l>Disturbs th' inaustrious hive, for malice sake,</l>
<l>Marring that honey, which he cannot make.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>An absent bard, engag'd in distant war,</l>
<l>This night appears by proxy at your bar:</l>
<l>As o'er Arabia's wilds he took his way,</l>
<l>From sultry Ormus and the realms of day,</l>
<l>His active mind, superior to its toil,</l>
<l>Struck out these scenes upon the burning soil.</l>
<l>No cooling grottoes, no umbrageous groves,</l>
<l>To win the Graces, and allure the Loves;</l>
<l>No Heliconian fount wherein to dip,</l>
<l>And slake the burning fever on his lip;</l>
<l>Before him all is desart, waste, and dry,</l>
<l>Above him flames the tyrant of the sky;</l>
<l>Around his temples gath'ring whirlwinds fight,</l>
<l>And drifts of scorching dust involve the light:</l>
<l>Oh, snatch your Poet from impending death,</l>
<l>And on his shrine we'll hang his votive wreath.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by Mr. GARRICK.</byline>
<stage>Spoken by Mrs. BARRY.</stage>
<l>AS it is prov'd, by <hi>scholars</hi> of great <hi>fame,</hi></l>
<l>That <hi>Gipsies</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> are the same;</l>
<l>I, from my throne of <hi>Memphis,</hi> shift the scene,</l>
<l>And of the <hi>Gipsies,</hi> now step forth the Queen!</l>
<l>Suppose, that with a blanket on my shoulder,</l>
<l>An old strip'd jacket, petticoat still older,</l>
<l>With ebon locks, in wild disorder spread,</l>
<l>The diadem, <hi>a clout about my head;</hi></l>
<l>My dingy Majesty here takes her stand,</l>
<l>Two children at my back, and one in hand;</l>
<l>With curtsey thus—and arts my mother taught,</l>
<l>I'll tell your fortunes, as a Gipsey ought:</l>
<l>Too far to reach your palms—I'll mark your traces,</l>
<l>Which fate has drawn upon your comely faces;</l>
<l>See what is written on the cutward skin,</l>
<l>And from the <hi>title page,</hi> know all <hi>within:</hi></l>
<l>First, in <hi>your</hi> faces<note n="*" place="foot">To the Upper Gallery.</note> I will mark each letter—</l>
<l>Had they been cleaner I had seen 'em better;</l>
<l>Yet through that cloud some rays of sun-shine dart,</l>
<l>An unwash'd face oft veils the cleanest heart.</l>
<l>That honest <hi>Tar,</hi> with <hi>Nancy</hi> by his side,</l>
<l>So loving, leering, whispers thus his bride,</l>
<l>" I love you Nancy, faith and troth I do,</l>
<l>" Sound as a biscuit is my heart, and true;</l>
<l>" Indeed, dear Johnny, so do I love you."</l>
<l>Love on, fond pair, indulge your inclination,</l>
<l>You ne'er will know, for want of education,</l>
<l><hi>Hate, infidelity,</hi> and <hi>separation—</hi></l>
<l><pb facs="5"/>
Some <hi>Cits</hi> I see look dull, and some look gay,</l>
<l>As in Change-Alley they have pass'd the day,</l>
<l>City <hi>Barometers!—</hi>for as stocks go,</l>
<l>What <hi>Mercury</hi> they have, is <hi>high</hi> or <hi>low.</hi></l>
<l>What's in the wind which makes that <hi>Patriot</hi> vere?</l>
<l>He smells a <hi>contract</hi> or <hi>lott'ry</hi> next year;</l>
<l>Some <hi>Courtiers</hi> too I see, whose features low'r,</l>
<l>Just turning <hi>patriots,</hi> they begin to <hi>sour;</hi></l>
<l>What in your faces can a Gipsey see?</l>
<l>Ye <hi>Youths</hi> of fashion, and of family!</l>
<l>What are we not to hope from taste, and rank?</l>
<l>All prizes in this lottery?—Blank—blank—blank—</l>
<l>Now for the <hi>Ladies</hi>—I no lines can spy</l>
<l>To tell their fortunes—and I'll tell you why;</l>
<l>Those fine-drawn lines, which would their fate displey,</l>
<l>Are, by the hand of <hi>fashion,</hi> brush'd away;</l>
<l>Pity it is, on beauty's fairest spot,</l>
<l>Where <hi>nature</hi> writes her best, they make a blot!—</l>
<l>I'd tell our <hi>Author's</hi> fortune, but his face,</l>
<l>As distant far as India from this place,</l>
<l>Requires a keener sight than mine to view;</l>
<l>His <hi>FORTUNE</hi> can be only told by <hi>YOU.</hi></l>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
<p>COLONEL DOW, when he sailed for India, left the following Tragedy in the possession of Mr. GARRICK. The event has shewn, that the reputation of an absent author could not have been trusted in safer hands. He spared no expence as a manager, no pains as a man of taste. The Scenery is strictly characteristical, and highly picturesque. The Dresses are magnificent and expensive, the Parts cast with great judgement; and the whole conducted with that regularity and ease, which can only be attained by a thorough knowledge of the Drama, and the business of the Stage. Mrs. BARRY, possessed of every power to touch, to penetrate, to dissolve the heart, exerted them in a degree that astonished while it pleased the audience. Mr. BARRY was judicious, chaste, and pathetic in Seraphis. Mr. REDDISH, spirited, and full of fire, in Menes. In their respective parts, the two AICKINS deserved and received great applause. Ample justice was done by Mr. PACKER, and others, to the rest of the characters. The public, and the author, are indebted to Mr. CUMBERLAND, for an elegant and classical Prologue: And to Mr. GARRICK, for one of the best Epilogues that ever was pronounced from the stage.</p>

<l>THOU pow'r divine! whose awful presence shakes</l>

<l>Was stretch'd to helpless mortals in distress,</l>
<l>O now protect a weak defenceless maid,</l>
<l>From Amasis, whose hands are drench'd in blood,</l>

<stage>(advancing from the altar.)</stage>
<l>Lo! the devoted victims are consum'd,</l>

<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Thou sacred prophet! whose enlighten'd mind</l>
<l>Pierces the shades of dark futurity,</l>
<l>What have the gods decreed? Am I condemn'd</l>
<l>To wed my father's murderer? The man</l>
<l>Who tore my destin'd husband from my arms,</l>
<l>Ev'n at the altar e'er the rites began,</l>
<l>And left me thus to sorrow, to despair.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORUS.</speaker>
<l>Daughter of grief! Sethona! every hour</l>
<l>Changes the state of things. To day the sea,</l>
<l>Rous'd by the Northern wind, assails the sky,</l>
<l>And wears the face of ruin. E'er the morn</l>
<l>Unveils her eyes, it smooths its ruffl'd brow,</l>
<l>And holds a mirrour to the stars of heav'n.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Orus, I owe this emblem of my fate</l>
<l>To thy humanity. What ray of joy,</l>
<l>Can pierce the deep, dark dwelling of my soul,</l>
<l>Where Menes lies entomb'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORUS.</speaker>
<l>Time will unfold</l>
<l>More than thy hopes could cherish. Know, this night,</l>
<l>This present hour, is pregnant with events,</l>
<l>To me in part reveal'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Ha! what events?</l>
<l>The dimest shade of hope, in grief like mine,</l>
<l>Fancy may work to comfort.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORUS.</speaker>
<l>As I stood</l>
<l>Before the altar of Ammonian Jove,</l>
<l>In fervent meditation, I beheld</l>
<l>The tow'rs of Memphis tottering, and the Nile</l>
<l>Rushing thro' all her gates. I heard a sound,</l>
<l><pb n="3" facs="10"/>
As when the winds, contending in their caves,</l>
<l>Disturb the mountains; saw the shadowy lines</l>
<l>Of banner'd armies closing in the air.</l>
<l>Streaming with blood, a headless trunk appear'd,</l>
<l>Grasping a scepter. O'er him strode in steel</l>
<l>The warlike form of Menes. Last uprose,</l>
<l>Dim thro' the gleam of arms, a hoary head</l>
<l>Encircled with a gorgeous diadem:</l>
<l>It seem'd thy father!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Seraphis! my father,</l>
<l>And Menes? hapless ghosts!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORUS.</speaker>
<l>Peace to their shades!</l>
<l>'Twas but a vision of the mental eye,</l>
<l>Th' unbodied semblances of future things,</l>
<l>And not departed spirits.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Hope begins</l>
<l>To dawn upon me. In thy words I feel</l>
<l>The force of inspiration. Yet my grief</l>
<l>Succeeds, like darkness to the transient gleam</l>
<l>Of some deluding meteor! Can the tomb</l>
<l>Give up its dead? Can Menes hear my voice,</l>
<l>And rescue me from the detested arms</l>
<l>Of Amasis? Can Seraphis restore</l>
<l>The long extinguish'd glories of his line?</l>
<l>Can I forget my sorrow? Idle dreams!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORUS.</speaker>
<l>And yet, such dreams may take substantial forms.</l>
<l>Three days have not elaps'd since from this fane</l>
<l>Menes was torn by Amasis, as yet</l>
<l>No certain tidings of his fate are known:</l>
<l>Tho' fame reports his death. To-day his friend,</l>
<l>Noble Otanes, by the king's command</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="11"/>
From Sais came, where he hath govern'd long,</l>
<l>Averse from courts, with dignity and fame;</l>
<l>Worthy his high desent from Egypt's kings.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Oh, might I see him, e'er the Tyrant's rage</l>
<l>Destroys his sacred life.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ORUS.</speaker>
<l>Fear not his rage.</l>
<l>The fate of Menes has already rais'd</l>
<l>A storm in Memphis, that may shake his throne.</l>
<l>Otanes, on his entrance, has received</l>
<l>The highest honours by a subject borne.</l>

<l>Alas, Myrtaeus! whither shall I fly?</l>
<l>Who can protect me! innocence is weak,</l>
<l>And tears, like the cold chrystal drops in caves,</l>
<l>Can only serve to petrify the heart</l>
<l>Of Amasis.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MYRTAEUS.</speaker>
<l>His soul is fierce, but love—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Speak not of love, from Amasis, nor think</l>
<l>So meanly of my virtue, of my faith,</l>
<l>And firm affection for departed Menes.</l>
<l>Tho' dead, his image dwells within my soul,</l>
<l>And leaves no room for others,—all my joys</l>
<l>Were grafted on him. Now the tree is fall'n,</l>
<l>And I am left to wither on the ground.</l>

<l>And mourn with thee for ever.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Oh! Myrtaeus!</l>
<l>He was a friend most worthy of thy tears:</l>
<l>Humane, susceptible of the distress</l>
<l>Of others, but unshaken by his own.</l>
<l>Gentle in peace, but terrible in war,</l>

<l>To some brown desart, far remov'd from man,</l>
<l>And in the shade of some poor lonely tree,</l>
<l>Beside a ling'ring stream, in silence sit,</l>
<l>And muse from morn to eve, from eve to morn.</l>
<l>Or tell my sister of the sky, that wanes</l>
<l>With me apace, the story of my woe;</l>
<l>There undisturb'd, I might devour my grief,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>AMASIS.</speaker>
<l>Forgive the past. The gods themselves forgive—</l>
<l>I have been much to blame. But if sincere</l>
<l>Repentance—If the pangs of keen remorse</l>
<l>Could e're attone for guilt, I stand absolv'd</l>
<l>And hope for thy forgiveness.—Hope for more,</l>
<l>Thy love—For which alone I risqu'd my life,</l>

<l>Ha! it is a crime</l>

<l>My love is not for thee. The guilty thought</l>
<l>Wou'd shake this sacred temple, and profane</l>
<l>The presence of the gods.—The shades of night,</l>
<l>The midnight hour of silence, the dark tomb</l>
<l>Of Seraphis my father, the long line</l>
<l>Of ancestry, that darkly rest in death</l>
<l>Within the sacred pyramids; on these</l>

<l>Or did their spirits hover round—can joy</l>

<sp>

<l>Since thou art safe,</l>
<l>Why should I question farther?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENES.</speaker>
<l>Thou shalt hear,</l>

<l>Of joy, indeed! That gives me back my love!</l>
<l>Where hast thou been? Oh, Menes, tell me where?</l>
<l>I will be calm—but let me hear it all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENES.</speaker>
<l>That day, on which we stood before the gods,</l>
<l>With willing vows, to consecrate our loves,</l>
<l>The tyrant's guards assaulted me unarm'd,</l>
<l>And tore me from Osiris and from thee.</l>
<l>Thro' paths unknown, they led me to a cell,</l>
<l>Cast me in chains; then raising from the floor</l>
<l>A pond'rous marble, to my view disclos'd</l>
<l>A dark deep pit, a dreary sepulchre!</l>
<l>Headlong they threw me down, to dwell with night,</l>
<l>Famine and horror, solitude and death!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>O dreadful state!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENES.</speaker>
<l>Cold, bruis'd, disconsolate,</l>
<l>With fetters gall'd, with mortal anguish torn,</l>
<l>I say, resign'd to destiny.</l>

<speaker>MENES.</speaker>
<l>Then rising up, I crept along the walls,</l>
<l>From place to place, and often in my arms,</l>
<l>Embrac'd th' embalm'd dead! Thro' many a cell</l>
<l>I wander'd cheerless. When a hollow sound</l>
<l>Roll'd murmuring thro' the tombs. I wish'd again</l>
<l>For silence—by degrees the noise approach'd—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Approach'd!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENES.</speaker>
<l>And soon a ray of livid light</l>
<l>Shot thro' the darkness. Then a form appear'd,</l>
<l>That seem'd not mortal, clad in vestments pure</l>
<l>As heav'n's meridian beam. His beard was white,</l>
<l>And pale his aged visage, faintly seen</l>
<l>By the blue taper, in his trembling hand.</l>
<l>Tow'rd me he mov'd; then claspt me in his arms,</l>
<l>And welcom'd me to liberty and life.—</l>
<l>I knew him then for Orus.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Happy sight!</l>
<l>What brought him thither?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENES.</speaker>
<l>Oft, at dead of night,</l>
<l>He visits his great ancestors. Releas'd</l>
<l>From all my chains. I trod his cautious path.</l>
<l>Thro' winding ways, he led me to the fane</l>
<l>Of great Osiris. Where I scarce had stood</l>
<l>An hour conceal'd, when by thy voice alarm'd</l>
<l>I rush'd to save thee!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Still my fears intrude</l>
<l><pb n="17" facs="24"/>
Upon my joys. Is Amasis inform'd</l>
<l>Of thy escape from death?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENES.</speaker>
<l>He knows it not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>How cam'st thou hither? Didst thou pass unseen, Unknown by all?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENES.</speaker>
<l>My steps to thee were led</l>
<l>By faithful Maeris.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>We're betray'd and lost!</l>
<l>He, with the times, has chang'd. Our sorrows all</l>
<l>Proceed from Maeris. When before the gods</l>
<l>We pledg'd our vows of love, to Amasis</l>
<l>He bore the grateful secret, and receiv'd</l>
<l>The price of perfidy. While yet I speak,</l>
<l>Thy late escape is to his ear convey'd.</l>
<l>This fatal hour the tyrant's vengeance falls</l>
<l>Again upon thee, Menes! Thou must fly,</l>
<l>And leave me to my fate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENES.</speaker>
<l>Thou do'st not mean</l>
<l>To wound my honour in the tenderest part,</l>
<l>By the proposal of a deed so base?</l>
<l>It must not be—Our fate has made us one,</l>
<l>And what but death can part us?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SETHONA.</speaker>
<l>Blame me not,</l>
<l>If my affection and my fears advis'd</l>
<l>The only means of safety.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENES.</speaker>
<l>Away, I claim no aid</l>
<l>To favour my revenge: No tedious forms</l>

<l>Shall quickly dash the tyrant's hopes of joy.</l>

<l>Whilst they prepare, my purpose must be lost,</l>

<l>THIS is the house of death! The dreary tomb</l>
<l>Of Egypt's ancient kings! What now remains</l>
<l>Of all their glory, but these mould'ring piles,</l>
<l>And these imperfect, mutilated forms</l>

<l>Conceal'd within the cave? whilst I attempt,</l>
<l>By promises and arguments, to draw</l>
<l>The troops from their allegiance. Thou, Otanes,</l>
<l>Safe in my conduct may'st instruct thy friends</l>
<l>That range without a leader, where to meet</l>
<l>And wait my further orders, to renew</l>

<l>The king! behold thy king!—thy ancient lord,</l>

<l>Sethona's voice, who comes, in her despair,</l>
<l>To mix the blood, that warms her heart, with thine.</l>
<l>Stretch forth thy pale hand, from that airy shroud,</l>
<l>And roll that cloud of sorrow from thy brow.</l>
<l>The blast of night is in my ears. The voice</l>
<l>Of dying winter does not thus complain.</l>
<l>Is there no rest for mortals in the tomb?</l>

<l>Art thou so much my friend?</l>

<l>But now I fear thy pity. Grant me death,</l>
<l>Nor look upon me, but with deadly rage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>AMASIS.</speaker>
<l>Thou hast prevail'd. Receive thy valour's prize.</l>
<l>The man that conquers Amasis, deserves</l>
<l>His throne, nay more, Sethona's love.—My guilt—</l>
<l>My guilt o'erwhelms me. By no vulgar hand,</l>
<l>I die.—The gods by thee avenge my crimes—</l>

<l>To crush my wretched head? What powerful charm</l>

<l>Since, now, my day of life declines apace,</l>
<l>My daughter and my sceptre shall be thine.</l>
<l>Thy care, Otanes, shall direct his steps,</l>
<l>And make his kingdom flourish. Thou, Myrtaeus,</l>
<l>Vers'd in the business of the field, shall guide</l>
<l>His youthful valour. None of all our friends</l>
<l>Shall be ungratified. Nor shalt our foes</l>
