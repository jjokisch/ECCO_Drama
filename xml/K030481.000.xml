<head>Advertisement.</head>
<p>THE precept, which directs a poet to keep his piece nine years, has been fully observed in regard to the following <hi>Tragedy;</hi> but the <hi>Author</hi> will not claim the merit of voluntary submission to critical authority. The delay, he acknowledges, did not arise from choice, but was rather the consequence of difficulties that stood in his way, and prevented an earlier access to the public.</p>
<p>The Play was written in the year 1762, and the British forces were then actually doing at the HAVAN NAH, what ALZUMA prays for in the third act. The subject appeared of the first importance to the interests of humanity. In perusing the history of the Spanish conquests in AMBRICA, the AUTHOR found among unenlightened savages such instances of generosity, truth, justice, courage, and even clemency, as would have done honour to those, who profess'd in that part of the world to spread the light of truth and civilization. The behaviour of ATA-HUALPA (called by English writers ATABALIPA) the last INCA of PERU, in his intercourse with FRYAR VINCENTI, appeared particularly striking. He heard the SPANISH MISSIONER with calm attention, and replied, <hi>that it was absurd on the part of the</hi> POPE <hi>to grant away a territory which did not belong to him; he would still continue to venerate the gods of his ancestors; and if the christians worshipped a god that died, he adored the sun that never died.</hi> He viewed the the prayer-book, which the fryar put into his hands, and after saying that it conveyed to him no information, threw it down with a smile. By this honest simplicity, which would have gained the affections of a generous mind, FATHER VINCENTI was so enraged, that he gave the word of command, crying out, <hi>"Kill the dogs, who trample under foot the word of God."</hi> An incident like this could not fail to excite indignation; and that indignation rose still higher, when it appeared that articles
<pb facs="3"/>of high treason were in form exhibited against ATAHUALPA, and, after that execrable farce of state, the prince of a world just discovered suffered as a rebel to the Emperor Charles V.—When GUATIMOZIN, one of the leading chiefs, lies stretched upon the rack, and, hearing the groans of his fellow sufferer, asks him, in perfect tranquillity, <hi>Am I upon a bed of roses?</hi> the heart, that does not melt with tenderness for the American, must be as hard as FRYAR VINCENTI'S. Not to multiply instances, the story of a people massacred because they abounded in gold-mines, and had not heard the important truths of the christian religion, seemed of all others the fittest for the English stage, as it tended in a strong degree to that pathetic distress, and that vigour of sentiment, which constitute the essential beauty of tragedy.</p>
<p>The author regretted that such a genius as DRYDEN had not left a play, free from the jingle of rhyme, and of a more legitimate kind, that the present attempt might have been excluded. He regretted also, that, from DRYDEN's time, the poets of this nation seem to have abandoned the poor Americans to their fate. He knew that FRANCE was in possession of a beautiful play upon the subject: but the taste of LONDON and PARIS being very different, the late Mr. AARON HILL's translation of that piece, appeared upon the English stage and vanished.</p>
<p>The present writer was of opinion that so interesting a subject ought not to be neglected. His first design was to new mould the ALZIRE of VOLTAIRE, not in a vain presumption that he could excel a writer so justly famous throughout Europe, but with an idea that he could in some instances adapt the scenes to the relish of an English audience. That plan, however, was soon deserted: it occurred, that if this author followed the steps of MONSIEUR DE VOLTAIRE, the words, FRENCH TRANSLATOR, UNBLUSHING PLAGIARY, would fill the columns of every news-paper. To civilities of this
<pb facs="4"/>kind the author has been used. If the persons who have been so liberal feel themselves disposed to lavish their favours on the present occasion, they will perhaps be glad of a hint, that may supply ample materials. If they will look into the plays of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES, they will perceive in what school the writer of ALZUMA has studied the art of constructing a fable.</p>
<l><hi>Aspice ut exuvias veterumque insignia nobis</hi></l>
<l><hi>Aptemus.—</hi></l>
<bibl>VIDA POETIC.</bibl>
<p>There was another reason for not adhering to the plan of VOLTAIRE: In a country like this, it was thought that our scene ought not to be indebted to a foreign writer for a play, which involves the first great point of human liberty, namely, the right of man to think for himself. In this opinion ALZUMA was written, and (except a few minute corrections in the course of the rehearsals) was, in its present form, ready for the stage above ten years ago.</p>
<p>There were, indeed, at that time certain reasons, which made the author unwilling to precipitate himself into a dealing with managers. Those reasons subsisted till Nov. 1767, when this tragedy was put into the hands of Mr. GARRICK. It was copied out by the prompter of Drury-Lane theatre, but remained in suspence till Sept. 1770, when the Author found it upon his table, without a letter, or even a card. The play, it is true, was not pronounced unworthy of representation, but certainly was treated as a piece that did not deserve the least dispatch. Delay was studied, and the reasons for that delay existed no where but in Mr. GARRICK's imagination. A certain political society, he was sure, would damn any production known to come from the pen of the present writer. Time, however, has shewn that he had not given umbrage to any set of men whatever. In political controversy he had not meddled for a number of years, and he takes this opportunity to declare, that in his
<pb facs="5"/>whole life he never was the author of one clandestine line. Whatever he writ, he had the spirit and honour to avow it. Mr. GARRICK was told this, but without effect: the play was thrown back upon the author's hands, he submitted to it, and would have consigned all the circumstances of that transaction to oblivion, if the same policy had not been practised upon him, in another inftance, this very winter.</p>
<p>That ALZUMA has at length appeared, is owing to the friendship of Mr. HARRIS. He desired to draw forth the piece from the author's closet: Mr. COLMAN accepted it with great frankness; and from that instant went right forward without delay, without duplicity, without equivocation. The author takes this opportunity to thank all the proprietors of Covent Garden Theatre for the fairness of their dealings: His thanks are also due to the performers for their assiduity in preparing the play for representation. The rest is before the public: Mr. BENSLEY and Mr. HULL did justice to their respective characters: Mr. SMITH's exertion of distinguished merit is well known. Miss MILLER struggled even in illness for the public favour, and Mrs. HARTLEYS' beauty and elegant performance adorned every scene, in which she appeared.</p>
<p>The Author cannot conclude without declaring, that (exclusive of his late transaction with Mr. COLMAN) he has every reason to be disgusted at the internal occurrences of a theatre. It is, therefore, probable that he shall never again be a candidate for Theatical Fame: From the farce of the APPRENTICE to the tragedy of ALZUMA his endeavours have at all times met with a most generous reception from the Town: He feels the obligation with the warmest sensibility, and remains with due respect to the PUBLIC,</p>

<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. BENSLEY.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>WHEN first COLUMBUS left the Spanish shore</l>
<l>In western climes new regions to explore;</l>
<l>Soon a new world, beyond the Atlantic main,</l>
<l>Disclos'd the wonders of it's vast domain;</l>
<l>A race of men unletter'd, and untaught,</l>
<l>Strangers to science, yet with virtue fraught.—</l>
<l>No school they had of philosophic pride,</l>
<l>And simple reason was their only guide.</l>
<l>That reason in the paths of nature trod,</l>
<l>And worshipping the Sun, they meant a God;</l>
<l>Free from the ills in polish'd life that spring,</l>
<l>And gold with them was a neglected thing.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But Europe's sons felt gold's resistless sway</l>
<l>To the new hemisphere they bend their way;</l>
<l>Through ev'ry region carry sword and sire,</l>
<l>And bigot rage and avarice conspire.</l>
<l>Zeal bore the cross and poniard in it's hand,</l>
<l>And massacre unpeopled half the land.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet to unhappy men, to heroes slain,</l>
<l>The British muse denies her tragic strain.</l>
<l>Dryden alone let fall the gen'rous tear,</l>
<l>And bade on Albion's stage the FEATHER'D CHIEFS appear.</l>
<l>His voice suppress'd, no bard their fate has sung,</l>
<l>Silent our scene, and mute each tuneful tongue;</l>
<l>While GREECE and ROME swell'd our theatric state,</l>
<l>And only classic heroes could be great.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>This night our author, an advent'er grown,</l>
<l>Dares trace the virtues of the Torrid Zone.</l>
<l>If in his scenes well painted passion glow;</l>
<l>If there you view the draught of human woe;</l>
<l>Britons will mark, from fierce religious zeal,</l>
<l>What dread calamities weak mortals feel;</l>
<l><pb facs="7"/>
Will hear the INDIAN—tho' in error blind,</l>
<l>Against the pow'r that would opinion bind,</l>
<l>Assert the freedom of the human mind.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Ye critics, to whom poets must be civil,</l>
<l>As Indians worship, out of fear, the devil,</l>
<l>Of mod'rate principles you'll own the merit,</l>
<l>Nor hither bring a persecuting spirit.</l>
<l>Let modes of wit some TOLERATION share;</l>
<l>Rome KILLS for error;—Be it yours to spare.</l>

<l>Still a calm repose</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l>But oh! too soon</l>
<l>With keener sense to waken her again</l>

<l>It verges to the dawn.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emira.</speaker>
<l>Then 'tis th' accustom'd hour, the only hour</l>
<l>Of all that circle time's diurnal round,</l>
<l>When Orellana knows suspence from pain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>The sun that form'd her, lent his brightest rays,</l>
<l>His purest elements of sacred fire.—</l>
<l>Hence all the virtues that but dimly shine.</l>
<l>In breasts of common mould, in her sublim'd,</l>
<l>Burn to a fierce extravagance of soul.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emira.</speaker>
<l>Yet what avails the great indignant spirit,</l>
<l>The gen'rous flame for Freedom and Peru?</l>
<l>The fever of her mind too soon must end</l>
<l>Her weary frame.—The live-long day it rages,</l>
<l>And each returning night,—when all things else</l>
<l>Thro' wide creation's round feel wonted rest,</l>
<l>She only wakes to misery:—Forlorn she sits</l>
<l>With streaming eyes, while unrelenting cares</l>
<l>Waste all within; and ever and anon</l>
<l>In short distracted dreams wild fancy acts</l>
<l>New scenes of terror in her blasted mind.</l>

<l>Horror! Protect me! Save me;—Seas of blood</l>

<speaker>Emira.</speaker>
<l>Attending thee we but obey the call</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orel.</speaker>
<l>Would heav'n I could!—But these imaginings</l>
<l>Were terrible indeed!—Round yonder couch</l>
<l>Such horrid phantoms rose.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emira.</speaker>
<l>Forget 'em all—</l>
<l>You've nothing now to fear.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orel.</speaker>
<l>Alas, the wretched</l>
<l>Have ev'ry thing to fear—Methought Pizarro</l>
<l>With fury dragg'd me to the altar's foot;</l>
<l>There urg'd imperious to renounce my gods,</l>
<l>And wed Don Carlos; with apostate zeal</l>
<l>My mother join'd her aid;—conspir'd against me;</l>
<l>When, oh! distracting sight! my brother, rushing</l>
<l>To save a sister from the vile dishonour,</l>
<l>Receiv'd Pizarro's dagger in his heart.—</l>
<l>The altar smoak'd with gore;—the cruel Spaniard</l>
<l>Look'd a grim joy to see the only hope</l>
<l>Of desolate Peru,—a Prince descended</l>
<l>From a long race of Kings, ignobly fall,</l>
<l>And welter in his blood before him.</l>
</sp>

<l>Yet,</l>

<l>Delusive thought! Yet let me fondly cherish</l>
<l>The soothing flattery.—Oh! Sister virgins,</l>

<l>And in his sight forget my sorrows past.</l>
<l>But oh! vain hope!—He would not know me now</l>
<l>Thus with'ring in my bloom—As yet an infant</l>
<l>number'd scarce ten years, when hence he went</l>
<l><pb n="4" facs="11"/>
To Chili's realms, ere the foe burst upon us,—</l>
<l>To learn the course of ev'ry orb above,</l>
<l>And all the myst'ries of his parent sun.</l>
<l>Mean time the Spaniard—but I'll not retrace</l>
<l>That tale of horror.—Since that hour accurst,</l>
<l>Ten times the sun hath made his annual circle,</l>
<l>Nor yet Alzuma reigns!—Alas! my virgins,</l>
<l>Distinction's lost amongst us, and the last</l>
<l>Surviving Inca of undone Peru</l>
<l>Sinks to a slave,—a wand'rer o'er the land!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emira.</speaker>
<l>Rekindle not the fury of your soul—</l>
<l>For lo! with purple light the orient morn</l>
<l>Glows in yon Eastern clime!—Don Carlos soon,</l>
<l>As is his wont, with early importunity</l>
<l>Will press his ardent suit. Be timely cautious,</l>
<l>Nor let him find pale grief and discontent</l>
<l>For ever dwell in Orellana's breast.—</l>
<l>'Twill rouze the Spaniard's rage—a cloyster'd virgin</l>
<l>With thee, I worship'd the eternal fire.—</l>
<l>'Tis friendship prompts, if I presume to wish</l>
<l>You'd not provoke the foe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orel.</speaker>
<l>I know thy truth,</l>
<l>Thy constancy approv'd;—and Carlos too</l>
<l>I grant has qualities that claim respect.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emira.</speaker>
<l>Tho' other gods he worship, yet in him</l>
<l>Religion wears a gentler mien, nor serves</l>
<l>To sanctify rapacity and murder.—</l>
<l>'Tis love perhaps,—for sure he fondly loves—</l>
<l>'Tis love perhaps,—not virtue,—that allays</l>
<l>His fiercer passions,—but whate'er the cause,</l>
<l>He is our shield from stern Pizarro's rage:</l>
<l>To him unnumber'd millions lift their hands,</l>
<l>And thank him with their tears for life preserv'd.—</l>

Ev'n Persecution rests upon her altar,</l>
<l>Thirsting for blood in vain.—And yet this heart</l>

<l>His once lov'd region, now a land of slaves,</l>
<l>To see the Spaniard triumph in his guilt,</l>
<l>Nor rolls th' avenging thunder o'er his head,</l>
<l>Nor sends the rapid light'ning down to blast him,</l>
<l>Tho' he disdain not still to shine alike</l>
<l>On vice and suffering virtue—Ha! no more—</l>
<l>'Twere impious madness—thou creat'st us all,</l>

<l>Recalls from error ev'ry wand'ring sense.</l>
<l>Alzuma shall not die—the Christian's God</l>
<l>Beams the sweet smiles of universal love</l>
<l>On all his fair creation—haughty Spain</l>
<l>Perverts his holy laws; but still the pow'r,</l>
<l>That warn'd my erring virtue, may inform him</l>
<l>Truth only triumphs when it conquers hearts,</l>
<l>And never gains by carnage and destruction.—</l>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ORAZIA.</stage>
<l>OH! Unexpected day of grief and joy!</l>
<l>My child, my child!—I have not yet forgot</l>
<l>To shed the tear of natural affection,</l>
<l>To know for whom I bore the child-bed pang;</l>
<l>I am not grown the horror of the world.—</l>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Orel.</speaker>
<l>Alas! all's lost—Don Carlos rages;—Stern Pizarro</l>
<l>Thirsts for Alzuma's blood—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>A mother's love</l>
<l>Shall still protect her offspring—Oh! My daughter,</l>
<l>Affection long an alien to this heart,</l>
<l>Gushes in tumult thro' each panting vein.</l>
<l>Despair and anguish too o'erwhelm my spirits—</l>
<l>Yet, Oh! returning nature! yet thy griefs,</l>
<l>Thy very tears are tinctur'd still with joy!</l>
<l>'Tis misery delightful—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orel.</speaker>
<l>Yet ev'n now,</l>
<l>The fell Gonzalez leads Alzuma forth.</l>
<l>Ah! whither do they lead him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>'Tis to me</l>
<l>They lead your brother forth—one interview</l>
<l>Unconscious of his name Pizarro grants.</l>
<l><pb n="44" facs="51"/>
Heav'ns! What an interview!—A son enslav'd,</l>
<l>And a fond mother, who usurps his rights!—</l>
<l>I cannot see my child!—And yet I must,</l>
<l>I will behold him!—Hear his sad, sad story,</l>
<l>Gaze on each seature—clasp him to my heart,</l>
<l>And perish with him, if he's doom'd to bleed.—</l>
<l>Thou fly to Carlos,—soothe his troubled mind;</l>
<l>Exert your influence, or your brother's lost.</l>
<l>Each moment's big with death.—</l>
</sp>

<l>The pris'ner from his dungeon waits your will.</l>

<l>His awful stern regard—</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Alzuma.</speaker>
<l>My firmness fails,</l>
<l>And guilty as she is, yet filial love,</l>
<l>Yet nature tells me, she's my mother still.</l>

<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Approach my son—Embrace your—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alzuma.</speaker>
<l>Conscious shame,</l>
<l><pb n="45" facs="52"/>
The sense of vile misdeeds—yes, goading conscience</l>
<l>Choaks up thy voice, and tells thee that thou art—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>A tyrant! an usurper!—That's the name</l>
<l>Of horror thou would'st utter—yet Orazia</l>
<l>Is not so far abandon'd o'er to guilt,</l>
<l>But my heart bounds with transport, even thus</l>
<l>At length to see my son—You weep Alzuma—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alzuma.</speaker>
<l>Thou source of light!—Bright majesty of Heav'n!</l>
<l>Thee I attest—from thee implore forgiveness</l>
<l>That thus I own a traitress; that these tears</l>
<l>Confess the sacred character of son</l>
<l>You stamp'd upon my nature.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Oh! Alzuma,</l>
<l>Did I command thy murder?—Earth and Heav'n!</l>
<l>A mother ready to imbrue her hands</l>
<l>In her child's—horror!—Why did'st thou conceal</l>
<l>The secret from me?—Why not rush for shelter</l>
<l>To these maternal arms?—But oh! I knew thee;</l>
<l>Parental instinct gave the sure alarm,</l>
<l>And now to hear thee, view thee thus,—it wakes</l>
<l>Unutterable throbbings in my breast.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alzuma.</speaker>
<l>Well may'st thou view me; well may'st thou survey</l>
<l>Thy son return'd!—He brings no foul dishonour—</l>
<l>But thou—can'st thou—indelible reproach!—</l>
<l>Oh! stain to virtue!—rage and indignation</l>
<l>Burn in my soul, and kindle madness there.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Let not impetuous rage disturb thy reason.</l>
<l>Heav'n on the Spaniards arms hath smil'd success;</l>
<l>Thence on Peru shone forth the ray of truth,</l>
<l>Sublimer faith, and pure exalted morals.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alzuma.</speaker>
<l>Morals!—Each word plants daggers in my heart—</l>
<l>Oh! Give me daggers rather; arm my hand</l>
<l><pb n="46" facs="53"/>
With their own deathful steel, that I may hold it</l>
<l>Crimson and glowing with the tyrant's blood,</l>
<l>Aloft to view, and call my country free.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Controul this phrenzy—it were impious murder—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alzuma.</speaker>
<l>Murder! a sacrifice! a glorious sacrifice!</l>
<l>To injured men, and violated laws.—</l>
<l>What! he that kill'd my father?</l>
<l>And yet she pleads a fell destroyer's cause!</l>
<l>Hold heart-strings, crack not yet—a curs'd invader,</l>
<l>Who thins the race of man!—Ev'n now the cry</l>
<l>Of infants murder'd at the fost'ring breast,</l>
<l>The shrieks of virgins, dying heroes groans</l>
<l>Sound in my ear—imperial palaces,</l>
<l>The temples of our gods all wrapt in fire!</l>
<l>Oh! image not, my soul, the horrid scene.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>I cannot bear his strong, his keen reproach.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alzuma.</speaker>
<l>Yet wedded to him!—well those tears may gush,</l>
<l>Well may those blushes glow upon thy cheek.</l>
<l>Detested perfidy!—My father's heart,</l>
<l>That heart, which ever beat with love of thee,</l>
<l>Dust as it is, awakens in his tomb,</l>
<l>Alive and sensible to guilt like thine;</l>
<l>It stirs, it rouzes in the shroud of death,</l>
<l>With horror at thy name, and feels it's pangs,</l>
<l>It's tortures o'er again.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Obdurate son!</l>
<l>Thus to transfix, and rend a mother's heart.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alzuma.</speaker>
<l>Am I upon a bed of roses?—Lo! in chains</l>
<l>My bleeding country! mark in ev'ry region</l>
<l>The desolation that lays waste the land!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Why wilt thou urge me to despair and horror?</l>
<l>Oh! kill me rather; let the deadly point</l>
<l><pb n="47" facs="54"/>
Pierce to my heart; I'll arm thee for the blow.</l>
<l>Avenge my crime; avenge your country's fall.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>Alzuma.</speaker>
<l>What says Orazia?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Stifle in my blood</l>
<l>The pious love I bear the Christian's God.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alzuma.</speaker>
<l>Would'st thou debase me to the Spaniard's guilt?</l>
<l>If thou indeed believ'st the Christian's God,</l>
<l>It is not mine to stab for human error.</l>
<l>Farewell! Farewell!—Live happy if thou can'st,</l>
<l>Oh! Heav'ns, if happiness can dwell with guilt.—</l>
<stage>Going.</stage>

<l>Thy tender strugglings—Oh! While thus thy hand</l>
<l>I bathe with tears, and print my kisses on it,</l>
<l>Let me implore thee, own your godsagain,</l>
<l>My father's spirit calls—the ghastly shades</l>
<l>Of martyr'd millions, martyr'd for their faith,</l>
<l>All lift their hands and call aloud for vengeance.—</l>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Well, Sir, Pizarro now has heard your counsel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
<l>And Orellana has heard thy advice;</l>
<l>That Indian captive too has heard you;—all</l>
<l>Thy arts are known; thy fair hypocrisy</l>
<l>To varnish treason.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Oh! Thou wrong'st me much;—</l>
<l>Another cause—a cause of tend'rest import;</l>
<l>It is the cause of ev'ry Christian virtue;</l>
<l>Love, justice, and humanity are in it;</l>
<l>All that the earth holds dear, and heav'n approves.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
<l>Treason, rebellion, perfidy are in it.</l>
<l>For Orellana's husband all your cares</l>
<l>Are tremblingly alive.—This very day,</l>
<l>But for thy treachery, the slave had died.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Misguided youth!—Alas! you little know</l>
<l>Th' eternal bar divine and human laws</l>
<l>Have fix'd between them—Orellana's husband!</l>
<l>Oh! no—believe it not—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
<l>And wherefore then</l>
<l>Alarm'd and wild with fear?—why every art</l>
<l><pb n="49" facs="56"/>
Of tears, of shrieks, and female lamentation,</l>
<l>To snatch the rebel from the stroke of justice.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Alas! these tears flow from the tend'rest source</l>
<l>That wakes soft pity in the human heart.</l>
<l>Carlos—I cannot speak—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
<l>Ha! Now by Heav'n</l>
<l>I see it all—guilt can no more dissemble—</l>
<l>That look betrays the secrets of the heart.—</l>
<l>The fraud stands manifest to view—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>Yet hear me,</l>
<l>Oh! Carlos, hear me, nor afflict thyself</l>
<l>With false, with vain surmise—Orazia's cares</l>
<l>Are busy for the wretched—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
<l>Has she then,</l>
<l>Perfidious fair!—has Orellana married</l>
<l>That base-born peasant?—And does he hope</l>
<l>With her, in evil hour, to claim the crown?</l>
<l>That is your aim; for that I am deceiv'd—</l>
<l>That care you colour with the specious name</l>
<l>Of generous sympathy for human kind.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orazia.</speaker>
<l>I feel it here—These are unbidden drops—</l>
<l>Tis you, rash youth, you, Carlos, that can give</l>
<l>Fair virtue's semblance to each wild emotion</l>
<l>That prompts the sudden deed—ere now 'twas love,</l>
<l>That tyrant of thy soul, capricious love,</l>
<l>Nay, gen'rous if you will; 'twas that which sav'd</l>
<l>The lives of men, if Orellana smil'd;</l>
<l>And now she looks averse, the baleful charm</l>
<l>Still shoots delicious poison thro' thy soul,</l>
<l>And persecuted men must pay the forfeit</l>
<l>Of maiden blushes, and of coy disdain.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
<l>Think'st thou Don Carlos means to live the slave</l>
<l>Of idle charms, and tyrant beauty's frown?</l>
<l>No—let her charms neglected fade and perish.</l>
<l><pb n="50" facs="57"/>
May sorrow wither ev'ry nameless grace</l>
<l>That revell'd once in those deluding eyes.</l>
<l>Then let her lover gaze on faded beauty;</l>
<l>Let him enjoy—Oh! no—the slave shall die—</l>
<l>Then shall his pale inanimated corse</l>
<l>Glare in her view, an offering from Don Carlos,</l>
<l>The token of his love.</l>

<l>And there her blood shall expiate, her guilt.</l>

<l>This who snall silence, who shall dare repeal?</l>
<l>Who strives to do it abdicates his nature;</l>

<l>Awaits thy crimes.—No dark assassin's stab</l>
<l>Ended his days:—To our tribunal call'd</l>

<l>Prevent the stroke—assuage Pizarro's sury—</l>
<l>That canst thou do, yet obstinately fix'd—</l>

<speaker>Orel.</speaker>
<l>Not talk,</l>
<l>When faith and truth, the sense of ancient honour</l>
<l>Are trampled down? when in base abject fear</l>
<l>A brother derogates from all his race,</l>
<l>Abjures at once his country and his gods,</l>

<l>I call each god to witness,</l>

<l>Forbear, forbear; the warning hand of heav'n</l>

<l>Dost thou forgive thy horrible assassin?—</l>
</sp>

<l>His woes are great</l>

<speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
<l>Alzuma hear me—</l>
<l>In thee I have beheld the fierce extreme</l>

<l>You've laid a scene of blood—But now behold</l>
<l>A Christian's virtue—By thy fatal arm</l>
<l>My father there lies dead—and I forgive you—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Alzuma.</speaker>
<l>Forgive!—Forgive me said'st thou!</l>

<speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
<l>Yes, nay more;</l>
<l>I pity your misfortunes—for your country</l>
<l>You've bravely fought! and I applaud your valour.</l>
<l>For the mistaken zeal which here by slaughter</l>
<l>Would plant the worship of the God of peace,</l>
<l>I do disclaim it all—That righteous God</l>
<l>Who gave the sun its light, and from his hand</l>
<l>Launch'd forth the stars into the void immense,</l>
<l>He tells weak erring man—We may persuade</l>
<l>Our fellow creatures to embrace their good,</l>
<l>But ev'n for truth itself must not destroy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orel. </speaker>
<stage>(Rising up)</stage>
<l>Oh! wherefore, Carlos, were those godlike virtues</l>
<l>To this sad hour conceal'd! Christians and Indians</l>
<l>Both, both have err'd alike—The cruelty</l>
<l>That mark'd its way with blood, provok'd revenge:</l>
<l>But this your effort of unheard of goodness,</l>
<l>Bids us repent ev'n of our country's love,</l>
<l>Ev'n of our gods, and Orellana's heart</l>
<l>Turns christian at the thought!—</l>

<l>Oh, lost Peru!</l>
<l>Fall'n, fall'n indeed!—thy foe was hitherto</l>
<l>A robber, and a murderer!—now he conquers;</l>
<l>Now his religion triumphs—all thy gods,</l>
<l>Oh, land belov'd! thy gods prepare for flight,</l>
<l>They yield to some divinity unknown,</l>
<l>Some great first cause of all!—and shall you sun</l>

Move at a maker's will his stated round,</l>
<l>No longer now ador'd!—the host of stars,</l>
<l>Shall they be deem'd his work? the rainbow too,</l>
<l>That over arches the wide tracts of air,</l>
<l>Is his the hand that bent it?—I am lost</l>
<l>In doubt and wonder!—Spaniard mark my words:</l>
<l>If such the virtues which your God inspires</l>
<l>We'll learn of thee to live. And oh! will learn</l>
<l>Thou murdered excellence! of thee to die.—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
<l>Enlighten'd hence, ye rulers of each state</l>
<l>Learn to extinguish fierce religious hate;</l>
<l>Truth came reveal'd from the eternal mind,</l>
<l>To bid us love, and not destroy mankind.</l>
<l>Not blast the work, which heav'n with pleasure owns,</l>

<byline>Spoken by Mrs. HARTLEY.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>OUR Play thus o'er, now swells each throbbing breast</l>
<l>With expectation of the coming jest.</l>
<l>By FASHION's law, whene'er the TRAGIC MUSE</l>
<l>With sympathetic tears each eye bedews;</l>
<l>When some BRIGHT VIRTUE at her call appears,</l>
<l>Wak'd from the dead repose of rolling years,</l>
<l>When SACRED WORTHIES she bids breathe anew,</l>
<l>That men may be,—what she displays to view;</l>
<l>By FASHION'S LAW, with light fantastic mien</l>
<l>The COMIC SISTER trips it o'er the scene;</l>
<l>Arm'd at all points with wit and wanton wiles,</l>
<l>Plays off her airs, and calls forth all her smiles;</l>
<l>Till each fine feeling of the heart be o'er,</l>
<l>And the gay wonder how they wept before.</l>
<l>Say, do you wish, ye bright, ye virtuous train,</l>
<l>That ev'ry tear that fell, should fall in vain?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>If this night's scenes soft pity could impart,</l>
<l>Tis yours to fix the fashion of the heart.</l>
<l>Adopt, ye fair, the lost Alzuma's cause,</l>
<l>His ruin'd empire, and expiring laws.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>For ORELLANA may I dare to plead?</l>
<l>My faults will all your kind indulgence need.</l>
<l>On you my hopes are fix'd:—One smile from you</l>
<l>To me is worth the treasures of PERU.</l>
