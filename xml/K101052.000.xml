<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>SPOKEN BY MR. WROUGHTON.</byline>
<sp>
<l>FAR from the haunts of men, of vice the foe,</l>
<l>The moon-struck child of genius and of woe,</l>
<l>Versed in each magic spell, and dear to fame,</l>
<l>A fair enchantress dwells, Romance her name.</l>
<l>She loathes the sun, or blazing taper's light:</l>
<l>The moon-beam'd landscape and tempestuous night</l>
<l>Alone she loves; and oft, with glimmering lamp,</l>
<l>Near graves new-open'd, or 'midst dungeons damp,</l>
<l>Drear forests, ruin'd aisles, and haunted towers,</l>
<l>Forlorn she roves, and raves away the hours!</l>
<l>Anon, when storms howl loud and lash the deep,</l>
<l>Desperate she climbs the sea-rock's beetling steep;</l>
<l>There wildly strikes her harp's fantastic strings,</l>
<l>Tells to the moon how grief her bosom wrings,</l>
<l>And while her strange song chaunts fictitious ills,</l>
<l>In wounded hearts Oblivion's balm distills.</l>
<l>A youth, who yet has lived enough to know</l>
<l>That life has thorns, and taste the cup of woe,</l>
<l>As late near Conway's time-bowed towers he stray'd,</l>
<l>Invok'd this bright enthusiasts magic aid.</l>
<l>His prayer was heard. With arms and bosom bare,</l>
<l>Eyes flashing fire, loose robes, and streaming hair,</l>
<l>Her heart all anguish, and her soul all flame,</l>
<l>Swift as her thoughts, the lovely maniac came!</l>
<l>High heav'd her breasts, which struggling passions rent,</l>
<l>As prest to give some fear-fraught mystery vent:</l>
<l><pb n="iv" facs="3"/>And oft, with anxious glance and alter'd face,</l>
<l>Trembling with terror, she relaxed her pace,</l>
<l>And stopt! and listened!—Then with hurried tread</l>
<l>Onwards again she rush'd, yet backwards bent her head,</l>
<l>As if from murderous swords or following fiends she fled!</l>
<l>Soon as near Conway's walls her footsteps drew,</l>
<l>She bade the youth their ancient state renew:</l>
<l>Eager he sped the fallen towers to rear:</l>
<l>'Twas done, and fancy bore the fabric here.</l>
<l>Next choosing from great Shakspeare's comic school,</l>
<l>The gossip crone, gross friar, and gibing fool—</l>
<l>These, with a virgin fair and lover brave,</l>
<l>To our young author's care the enchantress gave;</l>
<l>But charged him, ere he bless'd the brave and fair,</l>
<l>To lay th' exulting villain's bosom bare,</l>
<l>And by the torments of his conscience show,</l>
<l>That prosperous vice is but triumphant woe!</l>
<l>The pleasing task, congenial to his soul,</l>
<l>Oft from his own sad thoughts our author stole:</l>
<l>Blest be his labours, if with like success</l>
<l>They soothe their sorrows whom I now address.</l>
<l>Beneath this dome, should some afflicted breast</l>
<l>Mourn slighted talents, or desert opprest,</l>
<l>False friendship, hopeless love, or faith betray'd;</l>
<l>Our author will esteem each toil o'er-paid,</l>
<l>If, while his muse exerts her livelier vein,</l>
<l>Or tells imagined woes in plaintive strain,</l>
<l>Her flights and fancies make one smile appear</l>
<l>On the pale cheek, where trickled late a tear;</l>
<l>Or if <hi>her</hi> fabled sorrows steal one groan,</l>
<l>Which else her hearers would have given their own.</l>

<head>EPILOGUE.</head>
<byline>SPOKEN BY MRS. JORDAN.</byline>
<sp>
<l>OSMOND by this arrived at Charon's ferry,</l>
<l>My honour saved, and dad alive and merry,</l>
<l>Hither I come the public doom to know,</l>
<l>But come not uncompell'd—the more's my woe!</l>
<l>E'en now, (oh! pity, friends, my hard mishap!)</l>
<l>My shoulder felt a Bow-Street runner's tap,</l>
<l>Who, while I shook with fear in every limb,</l>
<l>Thus spoke, with accent stern and visage grim—</l>
<l>"Mistress!" quoth he, "to me it given in trust is,</l>
<l>"To bring you straight before our larned Justice;</l>
<l>"For, know, 'tis said, to-night, the whole town o'er,</l>
<l>"You've kill'd one Osmond, alias Barrymore."</l>
<l>"The fellow's mad!" 'twas thus amaz'd I spoke;</l>
<l>"Lord! Sir, I murdered Osmond for a joke.</l>
<l>"This dagger, free from blood, will make it certain,</l>
<l>"He died but till the prompter dropped the curtain;</l>
<l>"And now, well pleased to quit this scene of riot,</l>
<l>"The man's gone home to sup in peace and quiet!"</l>
<l>Finding that all I said was said in vain,</l>
<l>And Townshend still his first design maintain,</l>
<l>I thought 'twere best to fly for shelter here,</l>
<l>And beg my generous friends to interfere.</l>
<l>But though the awkward nature of my case</l>
<l>May spread some slight confusion o'er my face,</l>
<l>No terrors awe my bosom, I'll assure ye;</l>
<l>Just is my cause, and English is my jury!</l>
<l><pb n="vi" facs="5"/>Besides, it must appear, on explanation,</l>
<l>How very ticklish was my situation,</l>
<l>And all perforce, his crimes when I relate,</l>
<l>Must own that Osmond well deserved his fate.</l>
<l>He heeded not papa's pathetic pleading;</l>
<l>He stabbed mama—which was extreme ill-breeding;</l>
<l>And at his feet for mercy when <hi>I</hi> sued,</l>
<l>The odious wretch, I vow, was downright rude.</l>
<l>Twice his bold hands my person dared to touch!</l>
<l>Twice in one day!—'Twas really once too much!</l>
<l>And therefore justly filled with virtuous ire,</l>
<l>To save my honour, and protect my fire,</l>
<l>I drew my knife, and in his bosom stuck it;</l>
<l>He fell, you clapped—and then he kicked the bucket!</l>
<l>So perish still the wretch, whose soul can know</l>
<l>Selfish delight, while causing other's woe;</l>
<l>Who blasts that joy, the sweetest God has given,</l>
<l>And makes an hell, where love would make an heaven!</l>
<l>Forbear, thou lawless libertine! nor seek</l>
<l>Forc'd favours on that pale averted cheek:</l>
<l>If thy warm kisses cost bright eyes one tear,</l>
<l>Kisses from loveliest lips are bought too dear—</l>
<l>Unless those lips with thine keep playful measure,</l>
<l>And that sweet tear should be a tear of pleasure!</l>
<l>Now as for Osmond—at that villain's name</l>
<l>I feel reviving wrath my soul inflame!</l>
<l>And shall one short and sudden pang suffice</l>
<l>To clear so base a fault, so gross a vice?</l>
<l>No! To your bar, dear friends, for aid I fly!</l>
<l>Bid Osmond live again, again to die;</l>
<l>Nightly with plaudits loud his breath recall,</l>
<l>Nightly beneath my dagger see him fall,</l>
<l>Give him a thousand lives!—and let <hi>me</hi> take them all.</l>

<head><hi>SCENE I.</hi>—<stage>A Grove.</stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Father PHILIP <hi>and</hi> MOTLEY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Father PHILIP.</speaker>
<p>NEVER tell me!—I repeat it, you are a fellow of a very scandalous course of life!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>And I repeat it, I'm a perfect image of the purest virtue, compared to whom, for sobriety and continence, Cato was a drunkard, and Lucretia little better than she should be.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Oh! hardened in impudence!—Can you deny being a pilferer, a lyar, a glutton—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Can I?—Heaven be thanked, I've courage enough to deny any thing!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Doesn't all the world cry out upon you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Certainly my transcendant merit has procured me some enemies, and, in common with many other great men, my virtue at present labours under something of a cloud. But understand me right, Father: Though I don't assent to the sum-total
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
of your accusations, possibly I may acknowledge some of the items; the best actions frequently appear culpable, merely because their motives are unexplained. Therefore produce your charges, let me justify my conduct, and I doubt not I shall retrieve my reputation from your hands as immaculate and pure as a new sheet of foolscap.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>To begin then with your pilfering— Did you, or did you not, break open the pantry-door, and steal out the great goose-pye?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Begging your pardon, Father, that was no fault of mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Whose then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>The cook's undoubtedly; for if he hadn't locked the pantry-door, 'tis an hundred to one I shouldn't have taken the trouble to break it open.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Nonsense! Nonsense!—I tell you, you've been guilty of stealing, which is a monstrous crime! And what did you steal? Had you taken any thing else I might have forgiven you: but to lay irreverent hands upon the goose-pye!—As I'm a Christian, the identical goose-pye which I intended for my own supper!—But this is not my only objection to your conduct.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>No?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>What principally offends me is, that you pervert the minds of the maids, and keep kissing and smuggling all the pretty girls you meet. Oh! fye! fye!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>I kiss and smuggle them? St. Francis forbid! Lord love you, Father, 'tis they who kiss and smuggle me. I protest I do what I can to preserve my modesty; and I wish that Archbishop Dunstan had heard the lecture upon chastity which I read last night to the dairy-maid in the dark!
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
he'd have been quite edified. But yet what does talking signify? The eloquence of my lips is counteracted by the lustre of my eyes; and really the little devils are so tender, and so troublesome, that I'm half angry with nature for having made me so very bewitching.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Nonsense! Nonsense!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Why it was but yesterday that Cicely and Luce went to fifty-cuffs, quarrelling which looked neatest—my red leg, or my yellow one. Then they are so fond and so coaxing! They hang about one so lovingly! And one says, "Kind Mr. Motley!" and t' other, "Sweet Mr. Motley!"—Ah! Father Philip! Father Philip! How is a poor little bit of flesh and blood, like me, to resist such temptation?—Put yourself in my place: Suppose that a sweet smiling rogue, just sixteen, with rosy cheeks, sparkling eyes, pouting lips, &amp;c.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Oh! fye! fye! fye!—To hear such licentious discourse brings the tears into my eyes!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>I believe you, Father; for I see the water is running over at your mouth. However, this shews you—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>It shews me that you are a reprobate, and that my advice is thrown away upon you: In future I shall keep those counsels to myself, which I offered you from motives of pure Christian charity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Charity, my good Father, should always begin at home: Now, instead of giving yourself so much trouble to mend me, what if you thought a little of correcting yourself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>I?—I have nothing to correct.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>No, to be sure!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>The odour of my sanctity perfumes the whole kingdom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>It has a powerful smell about it, I own, not unlike carrion; you may wind it a mile off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>All malice!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Not exactly: I could mention some little points which might be altered in you still better than in myself; such as intemperance, gluttony—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Gluttony?—Oh! abominable falsehood!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Plain matter of fact!—Why will any man pretend to say that you came honestly by that enormous belly, that tremendous tomb of fish, flesh, and fowl? I protest I'm grateful to Heaven that among the unclean Beasts who accompanied Noah, there went not into the ark a pair of fat monks: they must infallibly have created a famine, and then the world would never have been re-peopled.—Next, for incontinence, you must allow yourself that you are unequalled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>I? I?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>You, you.—May I ask what was your business in the beech-grove the other evening, when I caught you with buxom Margery the miller's pretty wife? Was it quite necessary to lay your heads together so close?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Perfectly necessary: I was whispering in her ear wholsome advice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Indeed? Faith then she took your advice as kindly as it was given, and exactly in the same way too: you gave it with your lips, and she took it with hers!—Well done, Father Philip!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Son, Son, you give your tongue too great a licence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Father, be not angry: Fools, you know, are privileged persons.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>I know they are very useless ones; and in short, Master Motley, to be plain with you, of
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
all fools I think you the worst; and for fools of all kinds I've an insuperable aversion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Really? Then you have one good quality at least, and I cannot but admire such a total want of self-love! <stage>An horn sounds.</stage> But hark! 'tis the dinner-horn. Away to table, Father—Depend upon't, the servants will rather eat part of their dinner unblessed, than stay till your stomach comes like Jonas's whale, and swallows up the whole.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, fool, I am going: but first let me explain to you, that my bulk proceeds from no indulgence of voracious appetite. No, son, no: Little sustenance do I take; but St. Cuthbert's blessing is upon me, and that little prospers with me most marvellously. Verily, the Saint has given me rather too plentiful an increase, and my legs are scarce able to support the weight of his bounties. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p><stage>Alone.</stage> He looks like an over grown turtle, waddling upon its hind fins!—Yet at bottom 'tis a good fellow enough, warm-hearted, benevolent, friendly, and sincere; but no more intended by nature to be a monk, than I to be a maid of honour to the queen of Sheba. <stage>Going.</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> PERCY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>I cannot be mistaken: in spite of his dress, his features are too well known to me! Hist! Gilbert! Gilbert!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Gilbert? Oh Lord, that's I!—Who calls?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Have you forgotten me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Truly, sir, that would be no easy matter; I never forgot in my life what I never knew.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Have ten years altered me so much, that you cannot—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Hey!— Can it be— Pardon, my dear master, pardon!—In truth, you may well forgive my having forgotten <hi>your</hi> name, for at first I didn't very well remember my own. However, to prevent further mistakes, I must inform you, that he who in your father's service was Gilbert the knave, is Motley the fool in the service of Earl Osmond.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Of Earl Osmond? This is fortunate. Gilbert, you may be of use to me; and if the attachment which as a boy you professed for me still exists—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>It does with ardour unabated, for I'm not so unjust as to attribute to you my expulsion from Alnwic Castle: in fact I deserved it, for I cannot deny but that at twenty I was as good-for-nothing a knave as ever existed; consequently old Earl Percy dismissed me from his service, but I know that it was sorely against your inclination. You were then scarce fourteen, and I had been your companion and play-fellow from your childhood. I remember well your grief at parting with me, and that you slipped into my hand the purse which contained the whole of your little treasure. That act of kindness struck to my heart: I swore at the moment to love you through life, and it ever I forget my oath, damn me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>My honest Gilbert!—And what made you assume this habit?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my Lord! what could I do?—In spite of my knavery and tricks I was constantly upon the point of starving, and having once contracted an idle habit of eating, I never could bring myself to leave it off. After living five years by my wits, want drove me almost out of them: I knew not what course to take, when I heard that
<pb n="7" facs="13"/>
Earl Osmond's jester had fled the country. I exerted my knavery for the last time in stealing the fugitive's cast coat, was accepted in his place by the Earl, and now gain an honest livelihood by persuading my neighbours that I'm a greater fool than themselves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>And your change is for the better?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Infinitely; indeed your fool is universally preferred to your knave—and for this reason; your fool is cheated, your knave cheats: Now every-body had rather cheat, than be cheated.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Some truth in that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>And now, sir, may I ask, what brings you to Wales?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>A woman, whom I adore.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I guessed that the business was about a petticoat. And this woman is—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>The orphan ward of a villager, without friends, without family, without fortune!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Great points in her favour, I must confess. And which of these excellent qualities won your heart?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>I hope I had better reasons for bestowing it on her. No, Gilbert; I loved her for a person beautiful without art, and graceful without affectation—for an heart tender without weakness, and noble without pride. I saw her at once beloved and reverenced by her village companions: they looked on her as a being of a superior order; and I felt, that she who gave such dignity to the cottage-maid, must needs add new lustre to the coronet of the Percies.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>From which I am to understand that you mean to marry this rustic.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Could I mean otherwise, I should blush for myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Yet surely the baseness of her origin—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Can to me be no objection: in giving her my hand I raise her to my station, not debase myself to hers; nor ever, while gazing on the beauty of a rose, did I think it less fair because planted by a peasant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Bravo!—And what says your good grumbling father to this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Alas! he has long slept in the grave!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Then he's quiet at last! Well, God grant him that peace in heaven, which he suffered, nobody to enjoy on earth!—But, his death having left you master of your actions, what obstacle now prevents your marriage?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>You shall hear.—Fearful lest my rank should influence this lovely girl's affections, and induce her to bestow her hand on the noble, while she refused her heart to the man, I assumed a peasant's habit, and presented myself as Edwy the low-born and the poor. In this character I gained her heart, and resolved to hail, as Countess of Northumberland, the betrothed of Edwy the low-born and the poor!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>I warrant the pretty soul wasn't displeased with the discovery!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>That discovery is still unmade. Judge how great must have been my disappointment, when, on entering her guardian's cottage with this design, he informed me, that the unknown, who sixteen years before had confided her to his care, had reclaimed her on that very morning, and conveyed her no one knew whither.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>That was unlucky.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Was it not?—Ah! had I declared myself one day sooner, ere this she would have been my wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="15"/>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>True; and being your wife, if a stranger then had conveyed her no one knew whither, you might have thought yourself mightily obliged to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>However, in spite of his precautions, I have traced the stranger's course, and find him to be Kenric, a dependent upon Earl Osmond.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Surely 'tis not Lady Angela, who—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>The very same! Speak, my good fellow! do you know her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Not by your description; for here she's understood to be the daughter of Sir Malcolm Mowbray, my master's deceased friend. And what is your present intention?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>To demand her of the Earl in marriage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Oh!—that will never do:—for in the first place you'll not be able to get a sight of him. I've now lived with him five long years, and, till Angela's arrival, never witnessed a guest in the Castle.—Oh! 'tis the most melancholy mansion! And as to its master, he's the very antidote to mirth: He always walks with his arms folded, his brows bent, his eyes louring on you with a gloomy scowl: He never smiles; and to laugh in his presence would be high treason. He looks at no one—speaks to no one. None dare approach him, except Kenric and his four blacks— all others are ordered to avoid him; and whenever he quits his room, ding! dong! goes a great bell, and away run the servants like so many scared rabbits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Strange!—and <hi>what</hi> reasons can be have for —</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Oh! reasons in plenty. You must
<pb n="10" facs="16"/>
know there's an ugly story respecting the last owners of this Castle—Osmond's brother, his wife, and infant child, were murdered by banditti, as it was said: unluckily the only servant who escaped the slaughter, deposed, that he recognised among the assassins a black still in the service of Earl Osmond. The truth of this assertion was never known, for the servant was found dead in his bed the next morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Good heavens!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Since that time no sound of joy has been heard in Conway Castle. Osmond instantly became gloomy and ferocious; he now never utters a sound except a sigh, has broken every tye of society, and keeps his gates barred unceasingly against the stranger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Yet Angela is admitted:—But, no doubt, affection for her father —</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Why, no; I rather think that affection for her father's child —</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>If I've any knowledge in love, the Earl feels it for his fair ward: But the Lady will tell you more of this, if I can procure for you an interview.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>The very request which —</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>'Tis no easy matter, I promise you; but I'll do my best. In the meanwhile wait for me in yonder fishing hut—its owner's name is Edric; —tell him that I sent you, and he will give you a retreat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Farewell, then, and remember that whatever reward —</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Dear master, to mention a reward insults me. You have already shown me kindness; and
<pb n="11" facs="17"/>
when 'tis in my power to be of use to you, to need the inducement of a second favour would prove me a scoundrel undeserving of the first. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>How warm is this good fellow's attachment! Yet our Barons complain that the great can have no friends! If they have none, let their own pride bear the blame. Instead of looking with scorn on those whom a smile would attract, and a favour bind for ever, how many firm friends might our nobles gain, if they would but reflect that their vassals are men as they are, and have hearts whose feelings can be grateful as their own. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>Now, Hassan, what success?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>My search has been fruitless. In vain have I paced the river's banks, and pierced the grove's deepest recesses. Nor glen nor thicket have I passed unexplored, yet found no stranger to whom Kenric's description could apply.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>Saw you no one?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>A troop of horsemen passed me as I left the wood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>Horsemen, say you?—Then Kenric may be right. Earl Percy has discovered Angela's abode, and lurks near the Castle in hopes of carrying her off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>His hopes then will be vain. Osmond's vigilance will not easily be eluded—sharpened by those powerful motives, love and fear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>His love, I know; but should he lose Angela, what has he to fear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>If Percy gains her, every thing! Supported
<pb n="12" facs="18"/>
by such wealth and power, dangerous would be her claim to these domains should her birth be discovered. Of this our Lord is aware; nor did he sooner hear that Northumberland loved her, than he hastened to remove her from Allan's care. At first I doubt his purpose was a foul one: her resemblance to her mother induced him to change it. He now is resolved to make her his bride, and restore to her those rights of which himself deprived her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>Think you the Lady perceives that our Master loves her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>I know she does not. Absorbed in her own passion for Percy, on Osmond's she bestows no thought, and, while roving through these pompous halls and chambers, sighs for the Cheviot Hills, and Allan's humble cottage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>But as she still believes Percy to be a low-born swain, when Osmond lays his coronet at her feet, will she reject his rank and splendour?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>If she loves well, she will. Saib, I too have loved! I have known how painful it was to leave her on whom my heart hung; how incapable was all else to supply her loss! I have exchanged want for plenty, fatigue for rest, a wretched hut for a splendid palace. But am I happier? Oh! no! Still do I regret my native land, and the partners of my poverty. Then toil was sweet to me, for I laboured for Samba; then repose ever blest my bed of leaves, for there by my side lay Samba sleeping.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>This from you, Hassan?—Did love ever find a place in your flinty bosom?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>Did it? Oh Saib! my heart once was gentle, once was good! But sorrows have broken
<pb n="13" facs="19"/>
it, insults have made it hard! I have been dragged from my native land, from a wife who was every thing to me, to whom I was every thing! Twenty years have elapsed since these Christians tore me away: they trampled upon my heart, mocked my despair, and, when in frantic terms I raved of Samba, laughed, and wondered how a negro's soul could feel! In that moment when the last point of Africa faded from my view, when as I stood on the vessel's deck I felt that all I loved was to me lost for ever, in that bitter moment did I banish humanity from my breast. I tore from my arm the bracelet of Samba's hair, I gave to the sea the precious token, and, while the high waves swift bore it from me, vowed aloud endless hatred to mankind. I have kept my oath, I <hi>will</hi> keep it!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>Ill-starred Hassan! your wrongs have indeed been great.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>To remember them unmans me—Farewell! I must to Kenric. Hold!—Look, where he comes from Osmond's chamber!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>And seemingly in wrath.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>His conferences with the Earl of late have had no other end. The period of his favour is arrived.</p>

<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>How? Mean you that .....</p>

<p>His anxiety for independence, his wish to withdraw himself from Wales—yet more, certain mysterious words and threats for some time past have made our Lord uneasy. By him was I this morning commissioned .... Silence! He's here! you shall know more anon.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>His promise ever evaded! My request still heard with impatience, and treated with neglect!—Osmond, I will bear your ingratitude no longer.—Now, Hassan, found you the man described?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>Nor any that resembled him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>Yet, that I saw Percy, I am convinced. As I crossed him in the wood, his eye met mine. He started as had he seen a basilisk, and fled with rapidity. Be on your guard, my friends! Doubtless he will attempt to gain admission to the Castle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>Can we be otherwise than watchful, when we see how well the Earl rewards his followers?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>Of that, Kenric, you are an example. Have you obtained that recompence so long promised? Do you enjoy that independence which .....</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>Saib, the Earl's ingratitude cuts me to the heart! Attached to him from his infancy, I have long been his friend, long fancied him mine. The illusion is now over. He sees that I can serve him no further—knows that I can harm him much; therefore he fears, and, fearing, hates me! But I will submit no longer to this painful dependence. To-morrow, for the last time, will I summon him to perform his promise: If he refuses, I will bid him farewell for ever, and, by my absence, free him from a restraint equally irksome to myself and him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>Will you so, Kenric?—Be speedy then, or you will be too late.</p>

<p>I am weary of wandering from room to room; in vain do I change the scene, discontent is every where. There was a time when music could delight my ear, and nature could charm my eye:—when, as the dawn unveiled the landscape, each object it disclosed to me looked pleasant and fair; and while the last sun-beams yet lingered on the western sky, I could pour forth a prayer of gratitude, and thank my good angels for a day unclouded by sorrow!—Now all is gone, all lost, all faded!</p>

<p>Perhaps at this moment he thinks upon me! Perhaps he wanders on those mountains where we so oft have strayed, reclines on that bank where we so oft have sat, or listens sadly to the starling which he taught to repeat my name. Perhaps then he sighs, and murmurs to himself, The flowers, the rivulets, the birds, every object reminds me of my well-beloved; but what

<p>The Lord be thanked!—Then it was not the ghost. It was I, Lady! It was I!—And have you heard no other singing since you came to the castle?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>None. But why that question?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>Because, Lady— But perhaps you may be frightened?</p>

<p>No, no!—Proceed, I entreat you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>Why, then, they to say, that the chamber in which you sleep is haunted. You may have observed two folding-doors, which are ever kept locked: they lead to the Oratory, in which the Lady Evelina passed most of her time, while my Lord was engaged in the Scottish wars. She would fit there, good soul! hour after hour, playing on the lute, and singing airs so sweet, so sad, that many a time and oft have I wept to hear her. Ah! when I kissed her hand at the Castle-gate, little did I suspect that her fate would have been so wretched!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>And what was her fate?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>A sad one, Lady! Impatient to embrace her Lord, after a year's absence, the Countess set out to meet him on his return from Scotland, accompanied by a few domestics and her infant-daughter, then scarce a twelvemonth old. But, as she returned with her husband, robbers surprised the party scarce a mile from the Castle; and since that time no news has been received of the Earl, of the Countess, the servants, or the child.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Dreadful! Were not their corses found?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>Never! The only domestic who escaped pointed out the scene of action; and as it proved to be on the river's banks, doubtless the assassins plunged the bodies into the stream.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Strange! And did Earl Osmond then become owner of this Castle?—Alice! was he ever suspected of—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20" facs="26"/>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>Speak lower, Lady! It was said so, I own: but for my own part I never believed it. To my certain knowledge Osmond loved the Lady Evelina too well to hurt her; and when he heard of her death, he wept, and sobbed as if his heart were breaking. Nay, 'tis certain that he proposed to her before marriage, and would have made her his wife, only that she liked his brother better. Well she might indeed, for Earl Reginald was a sweeter gentleman by half.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>And in that Oratory, you say—Good Alice, you have the key of it: Let me see that Oratory to-night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>To-night, Lady? Heaven preserve me! I wouldn't enter it after dark for the world!</p>
</sp>

<p>But before dark, Alice?</p>

<p>Before dark? Why that indeed—Well, well, we'll see, Lady. But I hope you're not alarmed by what I mentioned of the Cedar-room?</p>

<p>No, truly, Alice; from good spirits I have nothing to fear, and heaven and my innocence will protect me against bad.</p>

<head><hi>SCENE I.</hi>—<stage>The Armoury.—Suits of Armour are arranged on both Sides upon Pedestals, with the Names of their Possessors written under each.</stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> MOTLEY, <hi>peeping in.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<p>THE coast is clear!—Hist! Hist!—You may enter.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> PERCY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Loiter not here!—Quick, my good fellow!—Conduct me to Angela!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Softly, softly! A little caution is needful; and I promise you just now I'm not upon roses. —You remember the servant who hinted that Earl Osmond had an hand in his brother's murder?— Should I be suspected of admitting you to the Castle, his fate might be mine; and whatever you may think of it, my Lord, I shouldn't be at all pleased at waking to-morrow morning, to find myself dead in my bed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>If such are your fears, why not lead
<pb n="22" facs="28"/>
me at once to Angela? Are we not more exposed in this open hall?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Be contented, and leave all to me: I will contrive matters so that Osmond shall have you before his eyes, and be no jot the wiser.—Here!— <stage>Taking down a suit of armour</stage>—Put on this coat of mail: you must make up your mind to play a statue for an hour or two.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>How?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Nay, 'tis absolutely necessary.—Quick! quick! ere the servants quit the hall, where they are now at dinner.—Here's the helmet!—the gauntlet!—the shield!—So now take this truncheon in your hand; and there we have you armed cap-a-pee!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>And now be good enough to explain what purpose this masquerade is to answer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Willingly. You are to know, that since the late Earl's death the Castle is thought to be haunted: the servants are fully persuaded that his ghost wanders every night through the long galleries, and parades the old towers and dreary halls which abound in this melancholy mansion. He is supposed to be drest in compleat armour; and that which you wear at present was formerly his. Now hear my plan. The Earl prepares to hold a conference with Lady Angela; even now I heard her summoned to attend him in the Armoury. Placed upon this pedestal you may listen to their discourse unobserved, and thus form a proper judgment both of your mistress and her guardian. As soon as it grows dark I will conduct you to Angela's apartments: the obscurity will then shelter you from discovery; and even should you be observed, you will pass for Earl Reginald's spectre.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>I do not dislike your plan: but tell me, Gilbert, do you believe this tale of the apparition?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="23" facs="29"/>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Heaven forbid! Not a word of it. Had I minded all the strange things related of this Castle, I should have died of fright in the first half-hour. Why, they say that Earl Hubert rides every night round the Castle on a white horse; that the ghost of Lady Bertha haunts the west pinnacle of the Chapel-Tower; and that Lord Hildebrand, who was condemned for treason some sixty years ago, may be seen in the Great Hall, regularly at midnight, playing at foot-ball with his own head! Above all, they say that the spirit of the late Countess sits nightly in her Oratory, and sings her baby to sleep! However, if it be so— <stage>A bell sounds thrice, loud and solemn</stage>—Hark! 'tis the Earl!—Quick to your post!— <stage>Percy <hi>ascends the pedestal</hi></stage>—Farewell! I must get out of his way; but as soon as he quits this chamber I'll rejoin you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Do so; and farewell. <stage><hi>Exit</hi> Motley.</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>The folding-doors are thrown open:</hi> Saib, Hassan, Muley, <hi>and</hi> Alaric <hi>enter, preceding</hi> Earl Osmond, <hi>who walks with his arms folded, and his eyes bent upon the ground.</hi> Saib <hi>advances a sopha, into which, after making a few turns through the room,</hi> Osmond <hi>throws himself. He motions to his attendants, and they withdraw. He appears lost in thought; then suddenly rises, and again traverses the room with disordered steps.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>I will not sacrifice my happiness to hers! For sixteen long years have I thirsted; and now when the cup of joy again stands full before me, shall I dash it from my lip? No, Angela, you ask of me too much. Since the moment when I pierced her heart, deprived of whom life became odious; since my soul was stained with his blood who loved me, with hers whom I loved, no form has been grateful to my eye, no voice spoken pleasure
<pb n="24" facs="30"/>
to my soul, save Angela's, save only Angela's! Doting upon one whom death has long clasped in his arms; tortured by desires which I never hoped to satisfy, many a mournful year has my heart known no throb but of anguish, no guest but remorse at committing a fruitless crime. Hope, that stranger, once more revisits my bosom: the fiend, who led me through passion's mazes to the heights of guilt, owns that a crime so great well merits a reward. He bids the monument's jaws unclose: Evelina revives in her daughter, and soon shall the fires which consume me be quenched in Angela's arms. What though her heart be Percy's? What though she prefer a basilisk's kiss to mine? Because my short-lived joy may cause her eternal sorrow, shall I reject those pleasures sought so long, desired so earnestly? That will I not, by Heaven! Mine she is, and mine she shall be, though Reginald's bleeding ghost flit before me, and thunder in my ear—"Hold! Hold!"—Peace, stormy heart! She comes!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ANGELA.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p><stage>in a softened voice.</stage> Come hither, Angela. Wherefore so sad? That downcast eye, that listless air, neither suit your age or fortunes. Raised from obscurity to rank and splendour, can this change call no smile upon your cheek? Wheree'er you turn, respect and adoration wait you; a thousand servants move obedient to your nod. The treasures of India are lavished to adorn your person; yet still do I see you, forgetting what you are, look back with regret to what you were!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Oh! my good Lord, esteem me not ungrateful! I acknowledge your bounties, but they have not made me happy. I still linger in thought
<pb n="25" facs="31"/>
hear those scenes where I passed the blessed period of infancy; I still thirst for those simple pleasures which habit has made to me most dear. The birds which my own hands reared, and the flowers which my own hands planted; the banks on which I rested when fatigued, the wild tangled wood which supplied me with strawberries, and the village church where I prayed to be virtuous, while I yet knew of vice and virtue but the name, all have acquired rights to my memory and my love!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>What? these costly dresses, these scenes of pomp and greatness—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Dazzle my eyes, but leave my heart unsatisfied. What I would meet with is affection, not respect; I had rather be obliged than obeyed; and all these glittering gems are far less dear to me, than one flower of a wreath which Edwy's hands have woven.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Confusion!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>While I saw you, Cheviot Hills, I was happy, Oh! how happy! While I listened to your artless accents, friends of my childhood, how swelled my fond heart with gratitude and pleasure! At morn when I left my bed, light were my spirits, and gay as the zephyrs of summer; and when at night my head again pressed my pillow, I whispered to myself, "Happy has been to-day, and to-morrow will be as happy!" Then sweet was my sleep; and my dreams were of those whom I loved dearest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Romantic enthusiast! These thoughts did well for the village maid, but disgrace the daughter of Sir Malcolm Mowbray: Let them be changed for others, better suited to your birth, to the fortune which awaits you. Hear me, Angela; an English baron loves you, a nobleman than whom
<pb n="26" facs="32"/>
our island boasts few more potent. 'Tis to him that your hand is destined, 'tis on him that your heart must be bestowed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>I cannot dispose of that which has long been another's—My heart is Edwy's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Edwy's? A peasant's?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>For the obscurity of his birth chance must be blamed; the merit of his virtues belongs wholly to himself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>By Heaven, you seem to think that poverty is a virtue!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I think 'tis a misfortune, not a crime: And when in spite of nature's injustice, and the frowns of a prejudiced and illiberal world, I see some low-born but illustrious spirit prove itself superior to the station which it fills, I hail it with pleasure, with admiration, with respect! Such a spirit I found in Edwy, and, finding, loved!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>My blood boils with passion!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>You say, that by two sentiments I disgrace my rank: I say, that to break my given word would disgrace it more. Edwy has my plighted faith: He received it on the last evening which I passed in Northumberland, as we sat on a low bench before old Allan's cottage. It was an heavenly night, sweet and tranquil as the loves of angels: A gentle breeze whispered among the honeysuckles which bloomed above us, and the full moon tinged with her silver light the distant towers of Alnwic. It was then that for the first time I gave him my hand, and I swore that I never would give it but to him! It was then that for the first time he pressed his lips to mine, and I swore that my lips should never be pressed by another!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Girl! girl! you drive me to distraction!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="27" facs="33"/>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>You alarm me, my Lord! Permit me to retire.— <stage>Going, Osmond detains her violently by the arm.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Stay!— <stage>in a softer tone.</stage> Angela! I love you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p><stage>starting.</stage> My Lord!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p><stage>passionately.</stage> Love you to madness!—My bosom is a gulph of devouring flames! I must quench them in your arms, or perish!—Nay, strive not to escape: Remain, and hear me! I offer you my hand: If you accept it, mistress of these fair and rich domains, your days shall glide away in happiness and honour; but if you refuse and scorn my offer, force shall this instant—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Force? Oh! No!—You dare not be so base!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Reflect on your situation, Angela; you are in my power—remember it, and be wise!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>If you have a generous mind, that will be my surest safeguard. Be it my plea, Osmond, when thus I sue to you for mercy, for protection! Look on me with pity, Osmond! 'Tis the daughter of the man you loved, 'tis a creature, friendless, wretched, and forlorn, who kneels before you, who flies to you for refuge! True, I am in your power: Then save me, respect me, treat me not cruelly; for—I am in your power!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>I will hear no more. Will you accept my offer?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Osmond, I conjure you—</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> ALICE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>Here's rudeness! Here's ill-breeding! On my conscience, this house grows worse and worse every day!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> MOTLEY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>What can he have done with himself? Perhaps weary of waiting for me in the Armoury, he has found his way alone to Angela. How now, dame Alice, what has happened to you? You look angry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>By my troth, fool, I've little reason to look pleased. To be frightened out of my wits by night, and thumped and bumped about by day, is not likely to put one in the best humour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Poor soul! And who has been thumping and bumping you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>Who has? You should rather ask who has not.—Why only hear:—As I was just now going along the narrow passage which leads to the Armoury—singing to myself, and thinking of nothing, I met Lady Angela flying away as if for dear life!—So I dropp'd her a curtsey—but might as well have spared my pains. Without minding me any more than if I had been a dog or a cat—she pushed me on one side; and before I could recover my balance, somebody else, who came bouncing by me, gave me t'other thump—and there I lay sprawling upon the floor. However, I tumbled with all possible decency, and took great care that my petticoats should cover my legs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Somebody else! What somebody else?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="30" facs="36"/>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>I know not—but he seemed to be in armour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>In armour? Pray, Alice, looked he like a ghost?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>What he looked like, I cannot say;— but I'm sure he didn't feel like one: However, you've not heard the worst. While I was sprawling upon the ground, my Lord comes tearing along the passage—The first thing he did was to stumble against me—away went his heels—over he came—and in the twinkling of an eye there lay his Lordship! As soon as he got up again —Mercy! how he stormed!—He snatched me up — called me an ugly old witch — shook the breath out of my body—then clapped me on the ground again, and bounced away after the other two!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>My mind misgives me!—But what can this mean, Alice?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>The meaning I neither know, or care about;—but this I know—I'll stay no longer in an house where I'm treated so disrespectfully. "My Lady!"—says I—"Out of my way!"—says she, and pushes me on one side. "My Lord," —says I—"You be damned!"—says he, and pushes me on t'other!—I protest I never was so ill used, even when I was a young woman!<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>This account alarms me!—Should Percy be discovered—The very thought gives me a creak in my neck!—At any rate I had better enquire whether— <stage>going</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Father</hi> PHILIP <hi>hastily.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p><stage>stopping him.</stage> Get out of the house! —That's your way!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31" facs="37"/>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Why, what's the meaning—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Don't stand prating here, but do as I bid you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>But first tell me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>I can only tell you to get out of the house. Kenric has discovered Earl Percy—You are known to have introduced him—The Africans are in search of you—If you are found, you will be hung out of hand. Fly then to Edric's cottage—hide yourself there!—Hark!—Some one comes! Away, away, ere it is too late!— <stage>pushing him out.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p><stage>confused</stage> But Earl Percy—But Angela—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Leave them to me! You shall hear from me soon. Only take care of yourself, and fly with all diligence!—Away!<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Motley.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p><stage>alone.</stage> So, so, he's off, and now I've time to take breath. I've not moved so nimbly for the last twenty years; and, in truth, I'm at present but ill calculated for velocity of motion. However, my exertions have not been thrown away: I've saved this poor knave from Osmond's vengeance—and should my plan for the Lady's release succeed—Poor little soul!—To see how she took on, when Percy was torn from her! Well, well, she shall be rescued from her tyrant. The moveable pannels—the subterraneous passages—the secret springs well-known to me—Oh! I cannot fail of success: But in order to secure it, I'll finally arrange my ideas in the Buttery. Whenever I've any great design in hand, I always ask advice of a flaggon of ale, and mature my plan over a cold venison-pasty. Oh! what an excellent genius must that man have had, who first invented eating and drinking!<stage>Exit.</stage></p>

<p>This, Sir, is your prison; but, doubtless, your confinement will not continue long. The moment which gives me Angela's hand shall restore you to liberty; and, till that moment arrives, farewell.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Stay, Sir, and hear me!—By what authority presume you to call me captive?—Have you forgotten that you speak to Northumberland's Earl?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Well may I forget him, who could so far forget himself. Was it worthy of Northumberland's Earl to steal disguised into my Castle, and plot with my servant to rob me of my most precious treasure?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Mine was that treasure—You deprived me of it basely, and I was justified in striving to regain my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Earl, nothing can justify unworthy means. If you were wronged, why sought you not your right with your sword's point? I then should have esteemed you a noble foe, and as such would have treated you: But you have stooped to paltry artifice, and attacked me like some midnight ruffian, privately, and in disguise. By this am I authorized to forget your station, and make your penance as degrading as your offence was base.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>If such are indeed your sentiments, prove
<pb n="33" facs="39"/>
them now. Restore my sword, unsheathe your own, and be Angela the conqueror's reward!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>No, Earl Percy!—I am not so rash a gamester as to suffer that cast to be recalled, by which the stake is mine already. Angela is in my power: The only man who could wrest her from my arms, has wilfully made himself my captive: Such he is, and such he shall remain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Insulting tyrant! Your cowardice in refusing my challenge proves sufficiently—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Be calm, Earl Percy!—You forget yourself. That I am no coward, my sword has proved in the fields of Scotland.—My sword shall again prove it, if, when you are restored to liberty, you still question the courage of my heart! Angela once mine, repeat your defiance, nor doubt my answering.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Angela thine?—That she shall never be! There are angels above who favour virtue, and the hour of retribution must one day arrive! — <stage>throws himself upon the couch.</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>My good fellows, you are charged with a disagreeable office, and to obey a tyrant's mandates cannot be pleasant to you; there is something in your looks which has prejudiced me too much in your favour to believe it possible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>Nay, there certainly is something in our appearance highly prepossessing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MULEY.</speaker>
<p>And I knew that you must admire the delicacy of our complexions!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>The tincture of your skin, my good fellow, is of little consequence: Many a worthy heart beats within a dusky bosom, and I am convinced that such an heart inhabits yours; for your looks tell me that you feel for, and are anxious to relieve, my sufferings.—See you this purse, my friends?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MULEY.</speaker>
<p>It's too far off, and I'm short-sighted. —If you'll put it a little nearer—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Restore me to liberty!—and not this purse alone, but ten times its value shall be yours.</p>

<p>STILL they come not!—Dear, dear, still they come not!—Ah! these tumults are too much for my old body to bear.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDRIC.</speaker>
<p>Then you should have kept your old body at home. 'Tis a fine thing truly for a man of your age to be galloping about the country after a girl, who, by your own account, is neither your chick nor child!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALLAN.</speaker>
<p>Ah! She was more to me! She was my all, Edric, my all!—How could I bear my home when it no longer was the home of Angela? How could I rest in my cottage at night when her sweet lips had not kissed me—and murmured, "Father, sleep well!"—She is so good! so gentle!—I was sick once, sick almost to death! Angela was then my nurse and comforter: She watched me when I slept, and cheered me when I woke: She rejoiced when I grew better; and when I grew worse, no medicine gave me ease like the tears of pity which fell on my burning cheeks from the eyes of my darling!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDRIC.</speaker>
<p>Tears of pity indeed! A little rhubarb would have done you more good by half.—But our people stay a long time: Perhaps Motley has been discovered and seized; if so, he will lose his life, the Earl his freedom, Angela her lover, and,
<pb n="43" facs="49"/>
what's worst of all, I shall lose my boat! I wish I hadn't lent it, for I doubt that Motley's scheme has failed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALLAN.</speaker>

<sp>

<p>And if it should break it, a mighty misfortune truly!—Zounds, Master Allan, any wife is at best a bad thing: a poor one makes matters get worse; but when she's old, Lord! 'tis the very devil!</p>

<speaker>ALLAN.</speaker>
<p>Three hundred chosen men are within the sound of your bugle. They scarce gave me time to signify your orders ere they sat in their saddles; and as I would needs come with them, Heaven forgive them for it! they put me on an hard-trotting horse!—Marry, he shook me rarely! he has almost broken my old bones:—But that matters little; my heart would have been broken had
<pb n="44" facs="50"/>
I staid behind.—But now, my Lord, tell me of Angela. Is she well? Did you speak to her? and speaks she sometimes of me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>She is well, my old friend, and I have spoken to her—though but for a moment. Scarce had I time to confess to her my rank, when Kenric, whose suspicious eye had penetrated my disguise, forced me from her presence. But be comforted, good Allan! Should other means fail, I will this very night attack the Castle, and compel Osmond to resign his prey.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALLAN.</speaker>
<p>Heaven grant that you may succeed!— Let me but once see Angela your bride! Let me but once hear her say the sweet words, "Allan, I am happy!" then I and my old wife will seek our graves, lay us down, and die with pleasure!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Die with pleasure, you silly old man! you shall do nothing so ridiculous: You shall live a great many years; and, instead of lying down in your grave, we'll tuck you up warm with your old wife in the best down-bed of Alnwic Castle.—But now let us talk of our affairs, which, if I mistake not, are in the high road to success.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>How? Has any intelligence reached you of your ally, the Friar?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>You have guessed it. As it passed beneath his window, the pious porpus contrived to drop this letter into the boat. Its contents must needs be of consequence; for I assure you it comes from one of the greatest men in England. Pray examine it, my Lord! I never can read when the wind's easterly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>I believe, Gilbert, were it northerly you would be no jot the wiser: I remember that many a sound stick did our preceptor break upon your back in vain; and before you had learned
<pb n="45" facs="51"/>
to spell, your schooling had cost my father a forest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p><stage><hi>while</hi> Percy <hi>reads.</hi></stage> Nay, if learning could have been beaten into me, by this time I should be a prodigious scholar!—To do him justice, Father Benjamin had a most instructive jirk with his arm, and frequently used arguments so forcible when pointing out my faults, that many a time and oft has he brought tears into my eyes: Then I generally felt so penitent, and so low, that I was obliged to steal his brandy-bottle in order to recover my spirits.—Well, Sir, what says the letter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Listen.—"I have recognised you in spite of your disguise, and seize the opportunity to advise your exerting yourself solely to obtain Earl Percy's liberty. Heed not Angela: I have sure and easy means for procuring her escape; and before the clock strikes two, you may expect me with her at the fisherman's hut. Farewell, and rely upon Father Philip."—Now, Gilbert, what say you? May the monk's fidelity be trusted?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>His fidelity may undoubtedly; but whether his success will equal his good intentions is a point which time alone can decide. Should it not—</p>

<p>Then with my faithful vassals will I storm the Castle to-morrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALLAN.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Be assured, old man, that nothing save invincible necessity shall induce me to bathe my hands in the blood of my fellow-creatures.—But where are my followers?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALLAN.</speaker>
<p>Fearing lest their numbers should excite suspicion, I left them concealed in yonder wood.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="46" facs="52"/>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Guide me to them. Edric, for this night I must request the shelter of your hut.</p>

<p>Willingly, my Lord! But my cottage is so humble, your treatment so wretched—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Silence, my good fellow! The hut, where good-will resides, is to me more welcome than a palace, and no food can be so sweet as that which is seasoned with smiles—You give me your best; a monarch could give no more, and it happens not often that men ever give so much. Now farewell for an hour—Allan, lead on!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>EDRIC.</speaker>
<p>Truly the task won't give you much trouble, for times have gone hard with me of late. Our present Lord sees no company, gives no entertainments, and thus I sell no fish. Things went better while Earl Reginald lived!</p>

<p>Fond of fish!—One of the cardinal virtues, of which I never heard before!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EDRIC.</speaker>
<p>But these thoughts make me sad. Come, Master Motley; your Lord's supper still swims in the river:—if you'll help to catch it, why do so, and thank you heartily. Can you fish?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>KENRIC.</speaker>
<p>Yonder he stalks, and seems buried in himself!—Now then to attack him while my late service is still fresh upon his memory. Should he reject my petition positively, he shall have good cause to repent his ingratitude. Percy is in the neighbourhood; and that secret, known only to myself, will surely— But, silence!—Look where he comes!</p>

<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>It shall not be! Away with these foreboding terrors, which weigh down my heart!— Does not all smile upon my fortunes?

once more!—I will forget the past, I will enjoy the present, and make those raptures again mine, which— Ah! no, no, no!—Conscience, that serpent, winds her folds round the cup of my bliss, and, ere my lips can reach it, her venom is mingled with the draught.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>How profound the gloom which obscures his brow!—How fixed, how hopeless glares his dark eye-ball!—Oh! dreadful is the villain's look, when he ponders on committed crimes!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Evening approaches fast— <stage>drawing near and opening the window.</stage> Already the air breathes cooler, and the beams of the setting sun sparkle on the waters of Conway. How fair, how tranquil all without! How dark, how comfortless all within!—Hark! the sound of music!—The peasants are returning from labour: they move with gay and careless steps, carolling as they go some rustic ditty; and will pass the night in rest, for they have passed the day in innocence!</p>

<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>Now then to accost him—Yet I tremble!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Anguish! endless, hopeless anguish!—Day or night, no moment of rest—When I sleep, dreams
<pb n="49" facs="55"/>
of strange horror still fright me from my couch! When I wake, I find in every object some cause for distrust—read the dread charge in every eye, "Thou art a murderer!"—and tremble lest the agents of my guilt should work its punishment.—And see where he walks, the chief object of my fears! —He shall not be so long!—His anxiety to leave me, his late mysterious threats—No, no! I will not live in fear.—Soft!—he advances!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>So melancholy, my Lord?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Aye, Kenric, and must be so, till Angela is mine. Know that even now she extorted from me a promise, that till to-morrow I would leave her unmolested.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>But till to-morrow?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>But till to-morrow?—Oh! in that little space a lover's eye views myriads of dangers!—Yet think not, good Kenric, that your late services are undervalued by me, or that I have forgotten those for which I have been long your debtor. When, bewildered by hatred of Reginald, and grief for Evelina's loss, my dagger was placed on the throat of their infant, your hand arrested the blow—Judge then how grateful I must feel when I behold in Angela her mother's living counterpart—behold her such as when, shielding with her body her fallen husband, Evelina received that dagger in her breast which I aimed at the heart of Reginald!—Worthy Kenric, how can I repay your services!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>These you may easily.—But what, Earl Osmond, what can repay me for the sacrifice of my innocence?—I was virtuous till you bade me be guilty—my hands were pure till you taught me to stain them with blood—you painted in strong colours the shame of servitude—you promised freedom, riches, independence—you vanquished the

resistance of my better Angel, and never since have I known one moment of rest!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Good Kenric—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>All here reminds me of my guilt—every object recalls to me Reginald and his murdered Lady!—Let me then claim that independence so long promised, and seek for peace in some other climate, since memory forbids me to taste it in this.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Kenric, ere named, your wish was granted. In a far distant country a retreat is already prepared for you: there may you hush those clamours of conscience, which must reach me, I fear, e'en in the arms of Angela.—Yet do not leave me till she is my bride—Stay yet a week in Conway Castle; and then, though 'twill cost me many a pang, Kenric, you shall bid it a long adieu.—Are you contented?</p>

May not resentment—may not Reginald's sixteen years captivity—Oh! no!

What if the ghost should pop out on me?
<pb n="53" facs="59"/>
Blessed St. Bridget, there would be a tête-à-tête! —Yet this is a foolish fear:—'Tis yet scarce eight o'clock, and your ghosts always keep late hours; yet I don't like the idea of our being such near neighbours. If Alice says true, the apparition just now lives next door to me; but the Lord forbid that we should ever be visiting acquaintance!— Would I had something to drive her out of my head! A good book now, or a bottle of sack, St. Augustine, or a cold venison pasty, would be worth its weight in gold: but in the chambers of these young girls one finds nothing good either to read, drink, or eat. Now my I last patroness, the Baroness O'Drench—Ah! to hear the catalogue of her crimes was quite a pleasure, for she always confessed them over a fir-loin of beef, and, instead of telling a bead, swallowed a bumper!—Oh! she was a worthy soul!—But hark!—Angela comes.</p>

<p>Before you! before the world!—Is my attachment a disgrace? No! 'tis my pride; for its object is deserving. Long ere I knew him, Percy's fame was dear to me. While I still believed him the peasant Edwy, often, in his hearing, have I dwelt upon Northumberland's praise, and chid him that he spoke of our Lord so coldly! Ah! little did I think that the man then seated beside me was he whom I envied for his power of doing good, whom I loved for exerting that power so largely!—Judge then, Earl Osmond, on my arrival here how strongly I must have felt the contrast!—What peasant names you his benefactor? What beggar has been comforted by your bounty? what sick man preserved by your care?—Your breast is unmoved by woe, your ear is deaf to complaint, your doors are barred against the poor and wretched. Not so are the gates of Alnwic Castle; they are open as their owner's heart.</p>

<p>The first may, Lady; but as to the second, he'll be of no use, depend on't. Now might I advise, you'd accept my Lord's offer: What matters it whether the man's name be Osmond or Percy? An Earl's an Earl after all; and though one may be something richer than t'other—</p>

<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>I help you to escape! Not for the best gown in your Ladyship's wardrobe! I tremble at the very idea of my Lord's rage; and, besides, had I the will, I've not the power. Kenric keeps the keys; we could not possibly quit the Castle

<p>I did, Lady; and the likeness was counted excellent.</p>

<p>Observe this picture; it conceals a spring, whose secret is unknown to all in the Castle except myself. Upon touching it, the pannel slides back, and a winding passage opens into the marble hall. Thence we must proceed to the vaulted vestibule; a door is there concealed, similar to this; and, after threading the mazes of a subterranean labyrinth, we shall find ourselves in safety on the outside of the Castle-walls.</p>

That thought is heaven. So glorious are my prospects, that they dazzle me to look on, and scarce can I believe them really to exist.—Oh! gracious God! should my brain be bewildered by fancy—should I be now the sport of some deceitful dream, seal up my eyes for ever, never let me wake again!—I must not expect the Friar before one.—Till that hour arrives, will I kneel at the feet of yonder Saint, there tell my beads, and pray for morning!</p>

<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>So! So!—Have I found you at last, Father?—I have been in search of you these four hours!—Oh! I've been so frightened since I saw you, that I wonder I keep my senses!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>So do I; for I'm sure they're not worth the trouble. And, pray, what has alarmed you thus? I warrant you've taken an old cloak pinned against the wall for a spectre, or discovered the devil in the shape of a tabby-cat.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE</speaker>
<p><stage>looking round in terror.</stage> For the love of heaven, Father, don't name the devil! or, if you must speak of him, pray mention the good gentleman with proper politeness. I'm sure, for my own part, I had always a great respect for him, and if he hears me, I dare say he'll own as much.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Respect for the devil, you wicked woman!—for that perfidious serpent—that crafty seducer—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>—Hush!—Hush!—Father, you make my teeth chatter with fright. For aught I know he's within hearing, for he certainly haunts this Castle in the form of my late Lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Form of a fiddlestick!—Don't tell me of your—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>Father, on the word of a virgin, I saw him this very evening in Lady Angela's bed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>In Lady Angela's?—On my conscience, the devil has an excellent taste! But, Alice!—Alice!—how dare you trot about the house at this time of night, propagating such abominable falsehoods?—One comfort is, that nobody will believe you. Lady Angela's virtue is too well known, and I'm persuaded she woudn't suffer the devil to put a single claw into her bed for the universe!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="62" facs="68"/>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>How you run on!—Lord bless me, she wasn't in bed herself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Oh!—Was she not?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>No, to be sure: But you shall hear how it happened. We were in the Cedar-room together; and while we were talking of this and that, Lady Angela suddenly gave a great scream. I looked round, and what should I see but a tall figure all in white extended upon the bed! At the same time I heard a voice, which I knew to be the Countess Evelina's, pronounce in an hollow tone — "Alice! — Alice! — Alice!"—three times. You may be certain that I was frightened enough. I instantly took to my heels; and just as I got without side of the door, I heard a loud clap of thunder, and the whole chamber shook as if tumbling into a thousand pieces!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Well done, Alice!—A very good story, upon my word: It has but one fault—'Tis not true.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>Ods my life, Father, how can you tell any thing about it? Sure I should know best; for I was there, and you were not. I repeat it—I heard the voice as plain as I hear yours: Do yon think I've no ears?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Oh! far from it: I think you've uncommonly good ones; for you not only hear what has been said, but what has not. Hark!—the clock strikes twelve:—'Tis late, and I'm sleepy, so shall bid you farewell for the present. As to this wonderful story of yours, Alice, I don't believe one word of it: I'll be sworn that the voice was no more like your Lady's than like mine; and that the devil was no more in the bed than I was. Therefore, take my advice, set your heart at
<pb n="63" facs="69"/>
rest, and go quietly to your chamber, as I am now going to mine.—Good-night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>Good-night?—Surely you'll not have the heart to leave me in this terrible situation!— Suppose Satan should appear to me when I'm alone! —Sinner that I am, I should certainly die of the fright!—Good Father, you are a priest, and an holy man; your habit frightens the evil spirits, and they dare not come near you:—Oh! if you will but suffer me to pass the night in your company—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Oh! monstrous!—Oh! impudence unparalleled! — You naughty, naughty woman, what could put such thoughts in your head?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>What's the matter now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Does not my sacred habit inspire you with awe?—Does not the exemplary chastity of my past life warn you to conceal such licentious desires?—Pass the night with me indeed?—I'm shocked at the very thought!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>The man's mad!—Father, as I hope to be saved—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Nay!—Come not near me!—Offer not to embrace me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>I embrace you?—Lord! Fellow, I wouldn't touch you for the universe!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Was it for this that you still flattered my person, and declared that nothing became a man more than a big belly? — Was it for this that you strove to win my heart through the medium of my stomach; that you used to come languishing every day with some liquorish dish; and, while you squeezed my left-hand tenderly, placed a sack-posset in the right?—Heavens! how deep-laid were your plans of seduction!—But mark me, tempter: In vain has the soup been salted, the
<pb n="64" facs="70"/>
ragout seasoned, and the pepper-box shaken with unsparing hand! My virtue is proof against all your culinary spells; the fairness of my innocence is still unblemished; and in spite of your luscious stews and savoury hashes, I retire like a second St. Anthony, victorious from Temptation's lists!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ALICE.</speaker>
<p>There, he's gone! — Dear heart! Dear heart! what shall I do now?—'Tis past twelve o'clock, and stay by myself I dare not.— I'll e'en wake the laundry-maid, make her sit up in my room all night; and 'tis hard if two women a'n't a match for the best devil in Christendom.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> SAIB <hi>and</hi> HASSAN.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>The Earl then has forgiven me!—A moment longer, and his pardon would have come too late. Had not Kenric held his hand, by this time I should be at supper with St. Peter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>Your folly well deserved such a reward. Knowing the Earl's hasty nature, you should have shunned him till the first storm of passion was past, and circumstances had again made your ministry needful. Anger then would have armed his hand in vain; for interest, the white-man's God, would have blunted the point of his dagger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>I trusted that his gratitude for my past services—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>European gratitude?—Seek constancy in the winds—fire in ice—darkness in the blaze of sun-shine! — But seek not gratitude in the breast of an European!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>Then, why so attached to Osmond? For what do you value him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="65" facs="71"/>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>Not for his virtues, but for his vices, Saib: Can there for me be a greater cause to love him? Am I not branded with scorn? Am I not marked out for dishonour? Was I not free, and am I not a slave? Was I not once beloved, and am I not now despised? What man, did I tender my service, would accept the negro's friendship? What woman, did I talk of affection, would not turn from the negro with disgust? Yet, in my own dear land, my friendship was courted, my love was returned. I had parents, children, wife! — Bitter thought—in one moment all were lost to me! Can I remember this, and not hate these white men? Can I think how cruelly they have wronged me, and not rejoice when I see them suffer?—Attached to Osmond, say you? Saib, I hate him! Yet viewing him as an avenging Fiend sent hither to torment his fellows, it glads me that he fills his office so well! Oh! 'tis a thought which I would not barter for empires, to know that in this world he makes others suffer, and will suffer himself for their tortures in the next!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>But say, you be one of those whom he causes to suffer, how then?—Hassan, I will sleep no more in the Lion's den!—My resolve is taken—I will away from the Castle, and seek in some other service that security—</p>

Hassan! Hassan! Death must be bliss, in flames or on the rack, compared to what I have this night suffered!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>Compose yourself, my Lord: Can a mere dream unman you thus?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>A mere dream, say'st thou? Hassan, 'twas a dream of such horror! Did such dreams haunt my bitterest foe, I would wish him no severer punishment. Mark you not, how the ague of fear still makes my limbs tremble? Rolls not my eye, as if still gazing on the Spectre? Are not my lips convulsed, as were they yet prest by the kiss of corruption? Oh! 'twas a sight, that might have bleached joy's rosy cheek for ever, and strowed the snows of age upon youth's auburn ringlets! Yet, away with these terrors!—Hassan, thou saidst, 'twas but a dream: I was deceived by fancy. Hassan, thou saidst true; there is not, there cannot be, a world to come.</p>

<speaker>HASS.</speaker>
<p>My Lord!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Answer me not!—Let me not hear the damning truth!—Tell me not, that flames await me!—that for moments of bliss I must endure long ages of torture!—Plunge me rather in the thickest gloom of Atheism!—Say, that with my body must perish my soul!—For, oh! should my fearful dream be prophetic!—Hark, fellows!— Instruments of my guilt, listen to my punishment! —Methought I wandered through the low-browed
<pb n="67" facs="73"/>
caverns, where repose the reliques of my ancestors! —My eye dwelt with awe on their tombs, with disgust on Mortality's surrounding emblems!— Suddenly a female form glided along the vault: It was Angela!—She smiled upon me, and beckoned me to advance. I flew towards her; my arms were already unclosed to clasp her—when suddenly her figure changed, her face grew pale, a stream of blood gushed from her bosom!—Hassan, 'twas Evelina!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB <hi>and</hi> HASSAN.</speaker>
<p>Evelina!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Such as when she sank at my feet expiring, while my hand grasped the dagger still crimsoned with her blood!—"We meet again this night!" murmured her hollow voice! "Now rush to my arms, but first see what you have made me!—Embrace me, my bridegroom! We must never part again!"—While speaking, her form withered away: the flesh fell from her bones; her eyes burst from their sockets: a skeleton, loathsome and meagre, clasped me in her mouldering arms!—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>Most horrible!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Her infected breath was mingled with mine; her rotting fingers pressed my hand, and my face was covered with her kisses!—Oh! then, then how I trembled with disgust!—And now blue dismal flames gleamed along the walls; the tombs were rent asunder; bands of fierce spectres rushed round me in frantic dance!—Furiously they gnashed their teeth while they gazed upon me, and shrieked in loud yell—"Welcome, thou fratricide!—Welcome, thou lost for ever!" —Horror burst the bands of sleep; distracted I flew hither:—But my feelings—words are too weak, too powerless to express them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="68" facs="74"/>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>My Lord, my Lord, this was no idle dream!—'Twas a celestial warning;—'twas your better Angel that whispered—"Osmond, repent your former crimes!—Commit not new ones!"— Remember, that this night should Kenric—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Kenric?—Oh! speak! Drank he the poison?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>Obedient to your orders, I presented it at supper; but ere the cup reached his lips, his favourite dog sprang upon his arm, and the liquor fell to the ground untasted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Praised be Heaven!—Then my soul is lighter by a crime!—Kenric shall live, good Saib. What though he quit me, and betray my secrets? Proofs he cannot bring against me, and bare assertions will not be believed. At worst, should his tale be credited, long ere Percy can wrest her from me, shall Angela be mine. Angela!—Oh! At that name all again is calm in my bosom. Hushed by her image my tumultuous passions sink to rest, and my terrors subside into that single fear, her loss!—I forget that I have waded to her arms through blood; forget all save my affection and her beauty!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SAIB.</speaker>
<p>You forget too that her heart is another's? Oh! my Lord, reflect on your conduct while it is yet time; restore the poor Angela to liberty; resign her to her favoured lover—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OSM.</speaker>
<p>Sooner will I resign my life!—Fellow, you know not what you say: My heart strings are twisted round the maid; ere I resign her, those strings must break. If I exist to-morrow night, I will pass it in her arms. — <hi>If</hi> I exist? — Ha! Whence that doubt? "We meet again this night!" —So said the Spectre!—Dreadful words, be ye blotted from my mind for ever!—Hassan, to your

vigilance I leave the care of my beloved. Fly to me that instant, should any unbidden foot-step approach yon chamber-door. I'll to my couch again. Follow me, Saib, and watch me while I sleep. Then, if you see my limbs convulsed, my teeth clenched, my hair bristling, and cold dews trembling on my brow, seize me!—Rouse me! —Snatch me from my bed!—I must not dream again.—Oh! faithless Sleep, why art thou too leagued with my foes? There was a time, when thy presence brought oblivion to my sorrows; when thy poppy-crown was mingled with roses! —Now, Fear and Remorse thy sad companions, I shudder to see thee approach my couch!—Blood trickles from thy garments; snakes writhe around thy brows: thy hand holds the well-known fatal dagger, and plunges it still reeking in my breast! —Then do I shriek in agony; then do I start distracted from thy arms!—Oh! how I hate thee, Sleep!—Friend of Virtue, oh! how I dread thy coming<note n="*" place="foot">This scene will doubtless have reminded the Reader of <hi>Clarence's Dream, Richard's Dream,</hi> &amp;c.: But it bears a much closer resemblance to the <hi>Dream of Francis in Schiller's Robbers,</hi> which, in my opinion, is surpassed by no vision ever related upon the Stage.

Perhaps, at this moment, his eyes like mine are fixed on yonder planet; perhaps, this sweet wind which plays on my cheek, is freighted with the sighs of my Lover.—Oh! sigh no more, my Percy!—Soon shall I repose in safety on your bosom; soon again see the moon shed her silver light on Cheviot, and hea: its green hills repeat the carol of your mellow horn!</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>What means this mystery?—This midnight visit—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>Is the visit of a Friend, of a Penitent!—Lady, I must away from the Castle:—The keys are in my possession:—I will make you the companion of my flight, and deliver you safe into the hands of Percy.—But, ere we depart <stage>kneeling</stage>—Oh! tell me, Lady, will you plead for me with one, who to me alone owes sixteen years of hard captivity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Rise, Kenric—I understand you not. —Of what captive do you speak?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>Of one, who by me has been most injured—who to you will be most dear!—Listen, Lady, to my strange narration.—I was brought up with Osmond—was the partner of his pleasures— the confident of his cares. The latter sprang solely from his elder brother, whose birth-right he coveted, whose superiority he envied. Yet his aversion burst not forth, till Evelina Neville, rejecting his hand, bestowed hers with her heart on Reginald.—Then did Osmond's passion over-leap all bounds. He resolved to assassinate his brother
<pb n="73" facs="79"/>
when returning from the Scottish wars, carry off the Lady, and make himself master of her person by force.—This scheme he imparted to me: he flattered, threatened, promised, and I yielded to his seduction!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Wretched man!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>Condemn me not unheard. 'Tis true, that I followed Osmond to the scene of slaughter, but no blood that day imbrued my hand. It was the Earl whose sword struck Reginald to the ground: it was the Earl whose dagger was raised to complete his crime, when Evelina threw herself upon her husband's body, and received the weapon in her own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Dreadful! Dreadful!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>His hopes disappointed by this accident, Osmond's wrath became madness. He gave the word for slaughter, and Reginald's few attendants were butchered on the spot. Scarce could my prayers and arguments save from his wrath his infant niece, whose throat was already gored by his poniard. Angela, yours still wears that mark.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Mine?—Almighty powers!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KEN.</speaker>
<p>Lady, 'tis true. I concealed in Allan's cottage the heiress of Conway: There were you doomed to languish in obscurity, till, alarmed by the report of his spies that Percy loved you, and dreading your meeting with so powerful a supporter, Osmond decreed your death a second time. With this intention he sought your retreat; but when in you he beheld Evelina's living image, he changed his bloody purpose. He caused me to reclaim you from Allan, and resolved, by making you his wife, to give himself a lawful claim to these possessions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>The monster! Now then I know, when
<pb n="74" facs="80"/>
he pressed my hand, why still my blood ran cold! 'Twas nature, that revolted at the fratricide's touch: 'Twas my mother's spirit, that whispered, "Love not my murderer!" Oh! Good good Kenric! And you knelt to me for pardon? You, to whom I owe my life! You, to whom—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KEN.</speaker>
<p>Hold! oh! hold!—Lady, how little do I deserve your thanks!—Oh! listen! listen!—I was the last to quit the bloody spot: Sadly was I retiring, when a faint groan struck my ear. I sprang from my horse; I placed my hand on Reginald's heart; it beat beneath the pressure!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Here</hi> Osmond <hi>appears at the door, motions to</hi> Saib, <hi>&amp;c. to retire, and advances himself unobserved.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>It beat! It beat! Cruel, and your dagger—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KEN.</speaker>
<p>Oh! that would have been mercy! No, Lady, I preserved his life to rob him of liberty. It struck me, how strong would be my hold over Osmond, while his brother was in my power; and this reflection determined me to preserve him, Having plunged the other bodies in the Conway's stood, I placed the bleeding Earl's on my horse before me, and conveyed him still insensible to a retreat, to all except myself a secret. There I tended his wounds carefully, and succeeded in preserving his life.—Lady, Reginald still exists.—</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Here</hi> Osmond <hi>with a furious look draws his dagger, and motions to stab</hi> Kenric. <hi>A moment's reflection makes him stay his hand, and he returns the weapon into the sheath.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Still exists, say you? My father still exists?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KEN.</speaker>
<p>He does, if a life so wretched can be termed existence. While his swoon lasted, I chained him to his dungeon wall; and no sooner were his
<pb n="75" facs="81"/>
wounds healed, than I entered his prison no more. Through a wicket in his dungeon-door I supplied him with food; and when in plaintive terms he sued to me for mercy, hasty I fled, nor gave an answer. Lady, near sixteen years have passed, since an human voice struck the ear of Reginald!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Alas! alas!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KEN.</speaker>
<p>But the hour of his release draws near: I discovered this night that Osmond seeks my life, and resolved to throw myself on your mercy. Then tell me, Lady, will you plead for me with your father? Think you, he can forgive the author of his sufferings?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>Kenric, you have been guilty, cruel— But restore to me my father; aid us to escape; and all shall be forgiven, all forgot.</p>

Compared to that which soon must be thine, these titles are sweet and lovely. Know'st thou the word parricide, Angela? Know'st thou their pangs who shed the blood of a parent?—Those pangs must be thine to-morrow. This long-concealed captive, this new-found father—</p>

<p>Still doubt you, that I both can, and will?—Remember Kenric's tale!—Remember, though the first blow failed, the second will strike deeper!—But from whom must Reginald receive that second?—Not from his rival brother! not from his inveterate foe!—From his daughter, his unfeeling daughter! 'Tis she, who, refusing me her hand, will place a dagger in mine; 'tis she, whose voice declaring that she hates me, will bid me plunge that dagger in her father's heart!</p>

<p>Yet if you still reject my offers, thus must it be. Tortures shall compel Kenric to reveal

what dungeon conceals your father; and ere to-morrow dawns shall Angela lie a bride in my arms, or Reginald a corse at my feet. Nay, spare entreaties!—Why should I heed your sorrows?— You have gazed unmoved upon mine!—Why should I be softened by your tears?—Mine never were dried by your pity!—Cold and inflexible have you been to <hi>my</hi> despair, so will I be to yours. Speak then, is Percy's love or your father's life most dear to you?—Does the false mistress or the unnatural child sound most grating in your ears?— Must Reginald die, or will Angela be mine?</p>

Blessed Mother! If indeed thy spirit still lingers amidst these scenes of sorrow, look on my despair with pity! fly to my aid! oh! fly, and save my father!— <stage>She remains for some moments prostrate on the ground in silent sorrow.

He will not tarry:—But I must not follow him!—I
<pb n="79" facs="85"/>
will not fly and abandon my father!—Yet may not my flight preserve him? Yes, yes, I will away to Percy: By the same passage which favours my escape, his vassals may easily surprise the Castle, may seize Osmond ere he effects his crime, and to-morrow may see Reginald restored to freedom, to his domains, and to his daughter! —Oh! then sweet indeed will be my feelings!— Then only can my heart know joy, when it throbs against a father's!—Ha! what was that?—Methought the sound of music floated by me! It seemed as some one had struck the guitar!—I must have been deceived—it was but fancy.</p>

<stage><hi>The folding-doors unclose, and the Oratory is seen illuminated.

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> PERCY <hi>and</hi> MOTLEY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTLEY.</speaker>
<p>IN truth, my Lord, you venture too near the Castle. Should you fall into Osmond's power a second time, your next jump may be into a better world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Oh! there is no danger, Motley. My followers are not far off, and will join me at a moment's warning; then fear not for me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart, but permit me to fear for myself. We are now within bow-shot of the Castle. The archers may think proper to amuse us with a proof of their skill; and were I to feel an arrow quivering in my gizzard, probably I should be much more surprised than
<pb n="81" facs="87"/>
pleased. Good my Lord, let us back to the fisherman's hut.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Your advice may be wise, Gilbert, but I cannot follow it. Angela's escape may be discovered—she may be pursued, and in need of my assistance. Then counsel not my retiring; my fears of losing Angela are too strong, the flame which burns in my bosom too ardent!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>I'm sure no flame burning in your bosom can give you so much pain as an arrow would give me sticking in mine; and as to your fears of losing the Lady, I'd bet mine of losing my life against any fears in Christendom!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>How, Gilbert? Have you not promised to stand by me to the last? Did you not say you could die in my service with pleasure?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Very true.—But, Lord! if a man was always taken at his word, the world would soon be turned upside down. When a polite gentleman begs you to consider his house as your own, and assures you that all he has is at your disposal, he'd be in a terrible scrape if you began knocking down his walls, or requested the loan of his wife or daughters!—No, no, Sir!—When I said that I should die in your service with pleasure, I intended to live in it many long years; since, to tell you the truth, from a child I had always a particular dislike to dying, and I think that with every hour the prejudice grows stronger.—Good my Lord, let us be gone. Ere long I doubt not—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Hark! Did I not hear—No! She comes not!—Heavens, should the Friar's plot have failed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Failed, and a Priest and a Petticoat concerned in it?—Oh! no; a plot composed of such good ingredients cannot but succeed.—Ugh!
<pb n="82" facs="88"/>
Would I were again seated by the Fisher's hearth! —The wind blows cruel sharp and bitter!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>For shame, Gilbert!—Am I not equally exposed to its severity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Oh! The flame in your bosom keeps you warm; and in a cold night love wraps one up better than a blanket <note n="*" place="foot">Sancho makes nearly the same observation upon sleep.</note>. But that not being my situation, the present object of my desires is a blazing wood-fire, and Venus would look to me less lovely than a smoking sack-posset!—Oh! when I was in love, I managed matters much better: I always paid my addresses by the fire-side, and contrived to urge my soft suit just at dinner-time. Then how I filled my fair-one's ears with fine speeches, while she filled my trencher with roast-beef!—Then what figures and tropes came out of my mouth, and what dainties and tid-bits went in!—'Twould have done your heart good to hear me talk, and see me eat—and you'd have found it no easy matter to decide, whether I had most wit or appetite.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>And who was the object of this voracious passion?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>A person well calculated to charm both my heart and my stomach: It was a Lady of great merit, who did your Father the honour to superintend his culinary concerns. I was scarce fifteen, when she kindled a flame in my heart, while lighting the kitchen fire, and from that moment I thought on nothing but her. My mornings were passed in composing poems on her beauty, my evenings in reciting them in her ear; for Nature had equally denied the fair creature and myself the faculty of reading and writing.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="83" facs="89"/>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>You were successful, I hope?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Why, at length, my Lord, a Pindaric Ode upon her grace in frying pancakes melted her heart. She consented to be mine— when, oh! cruel Fortune! taking one night a drop too much—poor dear creature! she never got the better of it!—I wept her loss, and composed an Elegy upon it, which has been thought, by many persons of great judgment, not totally destitute of taste and sublimity. It began thus—</p>
<l>Baked be the pies to coals! — Burn, roast-meat, burn!</l>
<l>Boil o'er, ye pots!—Ye spits, forget to turn!</l>
<l>Cindrelia's death—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Peace! peace!—See you nothing near yonder tower?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOTL.</speaker>
<p>Yes, certainly.—Two persons advance towards us—Yet they cannot be our friends, for I see neither the Lady's petticoat nor the Monk's paunch!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Still they approach, though slowly— One leans on his companion, and seems to move with pain.—Let us retire and observe them.</p>

<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<p>Amazement!—And is this known to Osmond?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>KENR.</speaker>
<p>Two hours have scarcely passed since he surprised the secret.—Tortures compelled me to avow where Reginald was hidden, and he now is in his brother's power.—Fly then to his aid!— Alas! perhaps at this moment his destruction is completed!—Perhaps even now Osmond's dagger—</p>

How often against that door have I knelt and prayed, and ever knelt and prayed in vain!—Fearful, lest my complaints should move him from his purpose, my gaoler listens not, replies not:—Hasty through yon wicket he gives my food, then flies as if this dungeon held a serpent.—Oh! then how my heart swells with bitterness, when the sound of his retiring steps is heard no more, when through yon lofty chasm I catch no longer the gleam of his departing torch!—How wastes my lamp?—

The hour of Kenric's visit must long be past, and still he comes not.—How, if death's hand hath struck him suddenly?—My existence unknown— —Away from my fancy, dreadful idea!— <stage>Rising, and taking the lamp</stage> —The breaking of my chain permits me to wander at large through the wide precincts of my prison,—Haply the late storm, whose pealing thunders were heard e'en in this abyss, may have rent some friendly chasm:— Haply some nook yet unexplored—Ah! no, no, no! — My hopes are vain, my search will be fruitless. Despair in these dungeons reigns despotic; she mocks my complaints, rejects my prayers, and, when I sue for freedom, bids me seek it in my grave!—Death! Oh! Death! how welcome wilt thou be to me!<stage>Exit.</stage></p>

<stage>The noise is heard of an heavy bar falling; the door opens.</stage>

<p>How's this? A door?</p>

<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>It was barred on the outside.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>That we'll forgive, as it wasn't bolted on the in. But I don't recollect—Surely I've not—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>What's the matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>By my faith, daughter, I suspect that I've missed my way.</p>

<p>Provoking! And did I not tell you to chuse the right-hand passage?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Truly, did you; and that was the very thing which made me chuse the left. Whenever I'm in doubt myself, I generally ask a woman's advice. When she's of one way of thinking,
<pb n="91" facs="97"/>
I've always found that reason's on the other. In this instance, perhaps, I have been mistaken: But wait here for one moment, and the fact shall be ascertained. But, perhaps, you fear being alone in the dark?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<p>I fear nothing, except Osmond.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>F. PHIL.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I've no more inclination to fall into his clutches again, than yourself. What would be the consequence? You would be married, I should be hung! Now, daughter, you may think that I've a very bad taste; but, as I'm a Christian, I'd rather be married fifty years, than hung for one little half-hour. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>

<p>I have oft wiped away tears, but never caused them to flow;—oft have I lightened the prisoner's chains, but never increased their burthen:—Yet I am doomed to chains and tears!</p>

<p>Each sound of his hollow plaintive voice strikes to my heart. Dared I accost him—Yet perhaps a maniac—No matter; he suffers, and the accents of pity will flow sweetly in his ears!</p>

<p>Thou art dead, and at rest, my wife!— Safe in yon skies, no thought of me molests thy quiet. Yet sure I wrong thee! At the hour of death thy spirit shall stand beside me, shall close mine eyes gently, and murmur, "Die, Reginald, and be at peace!"</p>

<p>Oh! that name recalls my terrors!— Alas! you see in me a fugitive from his violence! Guided by a friendly Monk, whom your approach has frightened from me, I was endeavouring to escape: We missed our way, and chance guided us to this dungeon. But this is not a time for explanation. Answer me! Know you the subterraneous passages belonging to this Castle?</p>

<head>TO THE READER.</head>
<p>MANY erroneous assertions have been made respecting this Drama; some, that the language was originally extremely licentious; others, that the sentiments were violently democratic; and others again, that if Mr. Sheridan had not advised me to content myself with a single Spectre, I meant to have exhibited a whole regiment of Ghosts. To disprove these reports I have deviated from the usual mode of publishing Plays, as performed, and have printed mine almost verbatim, as originally written. Whether it merited the above accusations, the reader has now had an opportunity of judging for himself. I must just mention that the last line of the Piece is altered, and that in the Second Scene of the Fifth Act, <hi>The Friar</hi> was made to stick in the door-way, whereas he now makes his exit without difficulty.</p>
<p>Other charges, however, have been brought against me on better grounds, and I must request the reader's patience while I say a few words respecting them. To originality of character I make no pretence. Persecuted heroines and conscience-stung villains certainly have made their courtesies and bows to a British audience long before the appearance of <hi>"The Castle Spectre;"</hi> the <hi>Friar</hi> and <hi>Alice</hi> are copies, but very faint ones, from <hi>Juliet's Nurse,</hi> and Sheridan's <hi>Father Paul,</hi> and <hi>Percy</hi> is a mighty pretty-behaved young gentleman with nearly no character at all. I shall not so readily give up my claim to novelty, when I mention my misanthropic <hi>Negro:</hi> He has been compared to <hi>Zanga;</hi> but Young's Hero differs widely from what I meant in <hi>Hassan. Zanga</hi>'s hatred is confined to one object; to destroy the happiness of that object is
<pb n="101" facs="107"/>
his sole aim, and his vengeance is no sooner accomplished, than he repents its gratification. <hi>Hassan</hi> is a man of violent passions, and warm feelings, whose bosom is filled with the milk of human kindness, but that milk is soured by despair; whose nature was susceptible of the tenderest affections, but who feels that all the chains of his affections are broken for ever. He has lost every thing, even hope; he has no single object against which he can direct his vengeance, and he directs it at large against mankind. He hates all the world, hates even himself; for he feels that in that world there is no one that loves him.</p>
<l>Lorsque l'on peut souffrir, sure que ses douleurs</l>
<l>D'aucun mortel ne font jamais couler les pleurs,</l>
<l>On se desinteresse à la fin de soi-même;</l>
<l>On cesse de s'aimer, si quelqu'un ne nous aime!</l>
<p>But though Hassan's heart is changed by disappointment and misfortune, that heart once was feeling and kind; nor could he hate with such inveteracy, if he had not loved with extreme affection. In my opinion this character is not <hi>Zanga's;</hi> but this I must leave to the public decision. I may, however, boldly, and without vanity, assert, that <hi>Motley</hi> is quite new to the Stage. In other plays the Fool has always been a sharp knave, quick in repartee, and full of whim, fancy, and entertainment; whereas <hi>my</hi> Fool (but I own I did not mean to make him so) is a dull, flat, good sort of plain matter of fact fellow, as in the course of the performance Mr. Bannister discovered to his great sorrow.</p>
<p>That <hi>Osmond</hi> is attended by <hi>negroes</hi> is an anachronism, I allow; but from the great applause which Mr. Dowton constantly received in <hi>Hassan</hi> (a character which he played extremely well), I am inclined to think that the audience was not greatly offended at the impropriety. For my own part, I by no means repent the introduction of my <hi>Africans:</hi> I
<pb n="102" facs="108"/>
thought it would give a pleasing variety to the characters and dresses, if I made my servants black; and could I have produced the same effect by making my heroine blue, blue I should have made her.</p>
<p>In the <hi>Friar</hi>'s defence, when he most ungallantly leaves <hi>Angela</hi> in the cavern to shift for herself, I can only plead the necessity of the case. Stay where he was he could not; go he must at any rate: I trundled him off in the best way that I could; and, for the sake of the public, I heartily wish that way had been better. With regard to his not meeting <hi>Osmond</hi> in his flight, a little imagination will soon conquer that difficulty: It may be supposed, that as he lost his way in coming, he lost it again in going; or, that he concealed himself till <hi>the Earl</hi> had passed him; or, that he tumbled down and broke his neck; or, that he....did any thing else you like better. I leave this matter entirely to the reader's fancy.</p>
<p>Against my <hi>Spectre</hi> many objections have been urged: one of them I think rather curious. She ought not to appear, because the belief in Ghosts no longer exists! In my opinion, this is the very reason why she <hi>may</hi> be produced without danger; for there is now no fear of increasing the influence of superstition, or strengthening the prejudices of the weak-minded. I confess I cannot see any reason why Apparitions may not be as well permitted to stalk in a tragedy, as Fairies be suffered to fly in a pantomime, or Heathen Gods and Goddesses to cut capers in a grand ballet; and I should rather imagine that <hi>Oberon</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> now find as little credit to the full as the <hi>Cock-lane Ghost,</hi> or the Spectre of <hi>Mrs. Veal.</hi></p>
<p>Never was any poor soul so ill-used as <hi>Evelina</hi>'s, previous to her presenting herself before the audience. The Friends to whom I read my Drama, the Managers to whom I presented it, the Actors who were to perform in it—all combined to persecute my <hi>Spectre,</hi> and requested me to confine my Ghost to

the Green-Room. Aware that without her my catastrophe would closely resemble that of the <hi>Grecian Daughter,</hi> I persisted in retaining her. The event justified my obstinacy: <hi>The Spectre</hi> was as well treated before the curtain as she had been ill-used behind it; and as she continues to make her appearance nightly with increased applause, I think myself under great obligations both to her and her representative.</p>
<p>But though I am conscious that it is very imperfect, I shall not so far offend my own feelings, or insult the judgment of the public, which has given it a very favourable reception, as to say that I think my Play very bad. Had such been my opinion, instead of producing it on the stage, or committing it to the press, I should have put it behind the fire, or, throwing it into the <hi>Thames,</hi> made a present of it to the British <hi>Scombri.</hi> Still its success on the stage (great enough to content even an author) does not prevent my being very doubtful as to its reception in the closet, when divested of its beautiful music, splendid scenery, and, above all, of the acting, excellent throughout. Without detracting from the merits of the other performers (to all of whom I think myself much indebted for their respective exertions), I must here be permitted to return particular thanks to Mrs. Jordan, whose manner of sustaining her character exceeded my most sanguine hopes, and in whose hands my heroine acquired an importance for which she was entirely indebted to the talents of the actress.</p>
