<p>THE FATE OF SPARTA; OR, THE RIVAL KINGS. A TRAGEDY. AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN DRURY-LANE. BY MRS. COWLEY.</p>
<p>LONDON: PRINTED FOR G. G. J. AND J. ROBINSON, PATER-NOSTER-ROW. MDCCLXXXVIII. [Price One Shilling and Six-pence.]</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="dedication">
<pb facs="2"/>
<head>TO JOHN COWLEY, ESQ.</head>
<p>WHEN letters were in their infancy, and when knowledge and the arts were groping their way through seemingly impervious mists, some splendid name was necessary to give an author celebrity—hence the custom of DEDICATIONS; hence those floods of adulation, which poured from the press, and outraged the feelings of the addresser and the addressed.</p>
<p>But now, when poets and writers of every denomination, accept patronage only from the public, and when fame is to be obtained only by deserving it, the custom of dedicating can be continued, only, as a medium through which to convey personal respect. It is <hi>delightful</hi> to make an offering to those we love, when that offering has had a value stampt on it, by the voice of the world. Thus THE FATE OF SPARTA wreathed with laurels, seeks you in the recesses of a counting-house; and whilst you are engaged in supporting our national manufactures, and invoking commerce from her distant abodes, solicits your attention to the MUSES.</p>
<p>When I hinted an intention to address this Tragedy to you, you shrunk from the idea, and desired me to choose a worthier name. My dearest Brother, where shall I
<pb n="iv" facs="3"/>
turn to find it? THIS shall <hi>not</hi> be an address of adulation, therefore I shall only observe, that those to whom you are known, will acknowledge that I am justified in the choice I have made of a patron; and those who know you not, will do my pride the credit to believe I should not have selected for that patron, a man whose name and whose situation did not reflect honour on me.</p>
<p>There is yet another motive for using my <hi>poetic wand</hi> to call your shade before posterity. As your regard has been one of the chief blessings of my life, I wish those who succeed us to know how much I hold myself indebted to it: I wish my own children and yours to feel the sweet influence of our mutual friendship; and as they will carry in their veins the same blood, to cherish in their hearts the same attachment. DEAR Children! who will wander again and again over this page, after the hand which traces it moves no more, after the heart to which it is addressed, hath ceased to beat!</p>
<p>I was going to conclude with this pensive idea, but I recollect that I have not yet mentioned in <hi>dedicatory form,</hi> the work dedicated. The following Tragedy then, Sir, is in its fable and events, all invention—except in the conduct of Chelonice, and the scene in the Temple;—and with the circumstance on which <hi>that</hi> is founded, I have taken some liberties. Other deviations from history will strike you, but if I have altered circumstances, I have strictly abided by CHARACTER. Leonidas at Drury-Lane, as in Sparta, is artful, tyrannical, and doats on his daughter. The impetuous and crafty Amphares, who
<pb n="v" facs="4"/>
had destroyed Agis, continues his system. Cleombrotus, ambitious and tolerably obstinate, is yet sensible to the merits of his wife. He, though my hero, is not "a faultless monster;"—if the lady should be <hi>too perfect,</hi> I appeal to the grave authority of Plutarch, who I believe is not suspected of writing fictions to compliment women.</p>
<p>Struck with admiration at the slight yet powerful touches, with which that biographist had sketched the character of CHELONIS <note n="*" place="foot">In his Life of Agis.</note>, I wondered such a character had never been brought on the Stage, to do honour to her sex;—yet I had joy in reflecting, that this was precisely the age in which it ought to be done, for this age boasted a Mrs. SIDDONS.</p>
<p>How much the FATE OF SPARTA has been indebted to that lady, and to some of the other performers, the public prints bear testimony—and I gratefully record it: because it is a circumstance highly flattering to myself, and because I wish the present I thus offer you, to be surrounded with every appendage that can make you feel it inestimable.</p>

<lg>
<l>TO ask your favour, we're by custom bound—</l>
<l>Thus Prologue bows before you to the ground.</l>
<l>But interchange of favours, we are told,</l>
<l>Is a choice method to make friendship hold.</l>
<l><hi>My</hi> gift is this;—those chilly wintry nights,</l>
<l>Whilst the frost glitters, and the north wind bites,</l>
<l>I'll waft you to the gentlest summer skies,</l>
<l>Where rose-buds swell, and the soft zephyr flies;</l>
<l>Where the bright sun, with scarce diminish'd ray,</l>
<l>November's month bids charm like florid May;</l>
<l>Where, beneath myrtle shades the lover dies,</l>
<l>Whilst gales, with fragrance fraught, perfume his sighs—</l>
<l>To GREECE I welcome ye from Drury-lane,</l>
<l>Where taste, and arts first rear'd th' immortal fane.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>You've heard of Spartan boys, who let young foxes</l>
<l>Feed on their blood, placid as beaus in boxes</l>
<l><hi>Sans</hi> shriek, or groan. You've heard of sable broth</l>
<l>More priz'd than rich ieed creams, and luscious froth;</l>
<l>With many other monstious—noble things,</l>
<l>At which more <hi>naughty</hi> times have had their flings.</l>
<l>But long posterior to that virtuous day,</l>
<l>Th' events were born on which we found our play.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<pb facs="6"/>
<l>Sparta conceiv'd a whim to be polite,</l>
<l>Black broth, and <hi>bosom</hi>'d foxes took their flight;</l>
<l>Then luxury her flood-gates open'd wide,</l>
<l>And fashion onward roll'd its heady tide;</l>
<l>Plain dress and frugal meals soon dropt their yokes,</l>
<l>And GODLIKE SPARTANS—liv'd like other folks;</l>
<l>Turn'd fidlers, brokers, merchants, gamed and betted,</l>
<l>This boasting what he <hi>won—</hi>this what he <hi>netted.</hi></l>
<l>Ladies their Op'ra—Boxers had their stage,</l>
<l>And <hi>Spartan Humphries'</hi> soon became the rage;</l>
<l>Their placemen sinecures could ne'er refuse,</l>
<l><hi>And zeal-infected Lords, at times turn'd Jews.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Their Doctors sage then hit upon a plan,</l>
<l>To mend the weak degen'rate creature Man.</l>
<l>They bad two monarchs wear the splendid crown,</l>
<l><hi>Castor and Pollux like—this up—that down? [In another voice</hi></l>
<l>Oh no, they both at once must mount the throne,</l>
<l>And subject slaves, in double slav'ry groan.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>'Twas wise, no doubt—yet this too pass'd away,</l>
<l>But first burst forth the deeds which fill our play.</l>
<l>The ground-work true—a little fancy grant,</l>
<l>Where FACT had in its bounties been but scant.</l>
<l>Poets will fib, all nations have allow'd it;</l>
<l>And ours with blushing terror has avow'd it.</l>
<l>Oh pardon where you can, and if YOU please,</l>
<l>This anxious hour precedes a night of ease.</l>

The rush of armies, and the shouts of death,</l>

<l>No wonder that Olympus should take part,</l>

<l>At length then, prince! I've traced thy wand'ring steps.</l>

<l>E'en the hired mercenaries, now, boast ardors;</l>
<l>And thou, whose <hi>all</hi> depends on this grand moment,</l>

<speaker>CLEOMBROTUS.</speaker>
<l>Not cool, Mezentius, tho' alone, and thoughtful—</l>
<l>For oh! my throbbing breast is <hi>torn</hi> with feeling.</l>
<l>The mercenary's heart expands with joy</l>
<l>For the rude hour of plunder; mine, my soldier</l>
<l>Contracts with fear, lest that wish'd hour should grasp</l>
<l>In undistinguish'd ruin, her I love,</l>
<l>With him, who though her father, I must hate.</l>

<l>The engines which must level yonder towers</l>
<l>May, as they play, form Chelonice's grave!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MEZENTIUS.</speaker>
<l>She hath forsaken thee.—This wife so lov'd,</l>
<l>Hath left thy bosom for a tyrant father's,</l>

<l>And if I woman know—</l>
</sp>

<l>Thou know'st not her!</l>
<l>Her's is no common heart.—Melting with love,</l>
<l>Alive to nature's softest impulses,</l>
<l>Tend'rest of all the tender faithful sex,</l>

<l>Firm and unbending, as the laws of truth.</l>

<l>With <hi>highest</hi> honour it shall speak yet err not.</l>
<l>When th' Ephori bestowed on me the crown,</l>
<l>Making me colleague with her faithless sire,</l>
<l>Thou'st heard how soon his lust of power impell'd him</l>
<l>To seek my ruin, and to reign alone.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MEZENTIUS.</speaker>
<l>His faction sunk, and you became triumphant!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEOMBROTUS.</speaker>
<l>'Twas then Leonidas, wrapt in despair,</l>
<l>Fled to Minerva's altar.—Chelonice</l>
<l>Followed him there, leaving a splendid throne</l>
<l>And all the joys that wait on royalty,</l>
<l>To weep, and watch upon the dewy pavement,</l>
<l>Where stretch'd, she found an abdicated father.</l>

<l>Have you not since oft woo'd her to your arms?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEOMBROTUS.</speaker>
<l>Oh yes, and there to fold her, would be transport!</l>
<l>But in her heart the filial principle</l>
<l>So strongly burns, that easier 'twere to woo</l>
<l>The murm'ring ring-dove from her unfledg'd brood</l>
<l><pb n="6" facs="13"/>
Than her, from him, who gave the charmer life.</l>
<l>She thinks his safety, too, hangs on her presence—</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NICRATES.</speaker>
<l>How wide th' event from the unblest design!</l>
<l>When Agis, the first colleague of our prince,</l>
<l>Lost by ambitious arts his crown and life,</l>
<l>The Ephori adjudg'd his vacant throne</l>
<l>To Chelonice's Lord;—uniting thus</l>

<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>Weak short-liv'd hope! for mutual jealousies</l>
<l>Soon sprung in either breast, which nurs'd by faction,</l>

<l>Whence are the king and princess?</l>

<l>Where vows and tears, and immolated victims,</l>

<l>Stern Fate demands far other immolations.</l>

<l>Too gayly placed for so sad a moment.</l>

<l>Brother! my spirit was not made for peace.</l>
<l>The burnish'd raven loves not more the tempest</l>
<l>In which he sails up-borne by warring winds,</l>
<l>Than I, the tempest of contending states:</l>

<l>Kindred, yet uncongenial, are our souls!</l>
<l>Hadst thou possess'd a mind less turbulent,</l>

<l>Royal Cleombrotus!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEOMBROTUS.</speaker>
<l>A priestess! say'st thou?</l>
<l>Surely of magnitude must be the errand</l>

<l><hi>Thou</hi> hast our sleep.—Our balmly rest lies tenter'd,</l>

<l><hi>Restore</hi> our rest! bid the soft God of sleep</l>
<l>Again revisit our long watchful lids!</l>

<l>Do Sparta's welfare, and her matrons' honour,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>CLEOMBROTUS.</speaker>
<l>I can do neither. I am bound by oath—</l>
<l>An oath revered by him who shakes Olympus,</l>

<l>To tell thee,</l>
<l>Obdurate Thracian! were to give thee words,</l>
<l>Whose foreign sounds would vibrate on thy ear,</l>
<l>But could not raise ideas in thy mind.</l>
<l>What dost <hi>thou</hi> know of all the sacred charms</l>
<l>Which hang on love connubial? Why tell <hi>thee</hi></l>
<l>Of the sweet philtres, on the rosy lips</l>
<l>Of chaste, yet tender beauty? Ears like thine</l>
<l>Would find no music in the tale; nor own</l>
<l>'Twas a sweet madness, so, to be undone!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MEZENTIUS.</speaker>
<l>Undone, indeed!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEOMBROTUS.</speaker>
<l>Yet not undone.—My promise</l>
<l>Binds me but a few hours.—Ere the blue heavens</l>
<l>Shall in its present station see again</l>
<l>You radiant orb—by arms, or peaceful terms,</l>
<l>I shall be king in Sparta.</l>

<speaker>CLEOMBROTUS.</speaker>
<l>True; war and victory</l>
<l>Seem'd then the road to lead me to my throne.</l>
<l>But should Leonidas propose those terms</l>
<l>On which I <hi>must</hi> consent to raise the siege,</l>

<l>To gild the hour, and make its joys sublime.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CLEOMBROTUS.</speaker>
<l>Such hours yet wait us, in the lap of peace.</l>
<l>Leonidas, I trust, hath now resolv'd</l>
<l>To spare the bosom of his native city,</l>

<l>I know thy question.</l>
<l>Tho' on no <hi>public</hi> errand I approach you,</l>
<l>Yet will you think the cause not less important,</l>
<l>Than if an empire's fate hung on my breath;—</l>
<l>An empire did I say? What then are empires?</l>
<l>What, all the mighty nothings which embroil,</l>
<l>From age to age, the sons of mad ambition—</l>

<l><hi>Why,</hi> Amphares,</l>

Since Chelonice at the altar vow'd,</l>
<l>The duties of connubial love to me.</l>
<l>Her heart I've studied; watch'd each turn of temper;</l>
<l>Nor ever saw caprice inhabit there.</l>
<l>Her virtues, tho' chastis'd by female softness,</l>
<l>Are of the grand and stubborn sort,</l>
<l>Which self-collected, smile upon temptation.</l>
<l>O! shall the rooted confidence of ages</l>
<l>Break from its stem, and be the sport of whispers?</l>
<l>No, Amphares; the husband of Chelonice</l>
<l>Can have no fears, but for his own demerits.</l>

<l>Th' impatient steps with which you seek the king;</l>

<l>And such the brow you wore, this early day,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>AMPHARES.</speaker>
<l>If thou believ'st, that I have power, and will,</l>
<l>To crush to earth the beings who offend me,</l>
<l>Why so licentious in reproof? If Agis</l>
<l>Thron'd as he was within his people's hearts,</l>
<l><pb n="51" facs="58"/>
Was from their bosoms dragg'd; if Chelonice,</l>
<l>Belov'd to dotage by her tyrant father,</l>
<l>Seeks at my bidding, patience in a prison—</l>
<l>What fate waits thee? Why urge the venom'd sting,</l>
<l>Fatal to Agis, and to Chelonice?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>NICRATES.</speaker>
<l>Thy threat appals me not; thy venom'd sting</l>
<l>May reach my heart, but shall not shake my virtue.</l>
<l>I've not been taught to fear to give reproof</l>
<l>For evil deeds, though acted by a brother;</l>
<l>And should'st thou dare to skreen thy guilty brows</l>
<l>Within the awful circle of a crown,</l>

<l>This bosom never shelter him, whose sword</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SARPEDON.</speaker>
<l>Oh! listen yet—</l>
<l>Cleombrotus himself opposed his soldiers,</l>
<l>And forc'd his conqu'ring troops back from the breach.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>LEONIDAS.</speaker>
<l>Thou deal'st in wonders! he force back his troops!</l>

<l>The fortune of the hour had been complete.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>SARPEDON.</speaker>
<l>Still are thy wishes prosperous! Cleombrotus</l>
<l>Beheld Amphares, and strait rush'd towards him,</l>
<l>But instant was closed in;—when like the fork</l>
<l>The lightning darts, which cleaves the stubborn rock</l>
<l>And nought resists, so pierc'd his way, Cleombrotus,</l>

<speaker>LEONIDAS.</speaker>
<l>Gods, ye are just! Astrea hath not fled</l>

<l>Scarcely ten full-orb'd moons have o'er our fields</l>

<l>It makes my blood</l>

<l>A moment since, the curse of age, <hi>chill cowardice</hi></l>
<l>Had seized upon my heart; but now I find</l>
<l>It was despair, pouring her torpid urn</l>
<l>Thro' every pulse.—Bright hope hath chas'd her hence,</l>
<l>I feel again the animating fires</l>
<l>That have so oft consum'd the foes of Sparta.</l>
