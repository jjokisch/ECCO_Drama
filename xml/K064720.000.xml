<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>AS I am under a necessity of giving a preface to the following work, I shall, in the language of our immortal countryman, <hi>imitate the</hi> ROMANS <hi>in brevity,</hi> as <hi>brevity is the soul of wit;</hi> and not be so studious of the necessary ornaments of stile, as of relating FACTS, with the unbiass'd integrity of a faithful and impartial historian. This I have thought fit to premise, that the reader may not imagine he is running over a jumble of <hi>facts and fiction;</hi> since it is but too common, with modern authors of the poetical cast, to lard their prefaces with a set of <hi>ingenious</hi> flourishes, which carry a greater air of rhodomontade than truth.</p>
<p>The following tragedy was originally written in <hi>Italian,</hi> by the celebrated Signior FUNIDOSO DELL'ARUNDO, formerly a ropemaker in <hi>Civita Vecchia;</hi> from which place he prudently retir'd, to avoid the addresses of the lady INQUISITION, who had a strange hankering after his person, on account of his libertinism in religion; for, though a <hi>Catholic</hi> in appearance, he was a <hi>Lutheran</hi> at heart. In the year 1751 he arrived in <hi>London,</hi> with that theatrical family of <hi>Italians,</hi> who gave the town such exquisite pleasure, in the performance of several incomparable <hi>burlettas,</hi> all, or most of which, are said (with what truth I will not venture to ascertain, as I am writing a narrative of FACTS) to be the production of our <hi>hempen genius.</hi></p>
<p>In the following year, which the reader, without my chronological assistance, will be able to discover to be the year 1752, Signior DELL'ARUNDO took shipping for <hi>Newcastle,</hi> with an intention of residing in that part of the world, on account of the cheapness of the necessaries of life, and accordingly settled in a sea port about thirty miles to the southward of that place. He had not been many months in his new residence, till he married a widow, who was somewhat past the <hi>heyday of her blood;</hi> or, to speak less poetically, pretty well stricken in years; and before he had been a dozen moons in his alter'd state, to his great affliction, he lost his lady. I might here, according to the usual prolixity of historians, take up my reader's time, by telling him of what distemper the <hi>Signiora</hi> departed this life; but, as I don't intend to clog my narrative with <hi>useless matters,</hi> I shall be totally silent on the occasion: nay, I am so great a lover of conciseness in history, that I shall not even so far intrude on my candid reader's leisure, as to inform him that the lady died of a fit of the cholic.</p>
<p>As our <hi>Italian phoenomenon</hi> was a great admirer of poetry, it is no wonder, after he had acquir'd a competent knowledge of the <hi>British</hi> language, that he receiv'd so sensible a pleasure from the perusal of the <hi>English</hi> poets. He was so captivated with the <hi>masterly style and expression</hi> of our dramatic authors (especially <hi>the more modern
<pb n="iv" facs="4"/>ones)</hi> that he resolv'd to collect the principal beauties in our language, and throw them into a tragedy, form'd on the <hi>British</hi> plan, in his native tongue; which he at length so happily executed, that his performance will <hi>undoubtedly</hi> be an honour to literature in general, and to the <hi>Italian</hi> language in particular.</p>
<p>In <hi>October</hi> 1756, our celebrated foreigner departed this life; and, according to the phrase of our diurnal scribblers, <hi>universally lamented by all his acquaintance;</hi> and as a perpetual monument of the friendship, which had long existed between <hi>us,</hi> left his valueable performance to my care, in the following words contain'd in the body of his last will and testament.</p>
<p><hi>Item, I give and devise to my most dear friend, brother bard, and brother rope-maker,</hi> JOSEPH REED, <hi>late of</hi> STOCKTON <hi>aforesaid, now of</hi> KING DAVID'S FORT, <hi>near</hi> Sun-Tavern-Fields, London, <hi>all and singular my piece, production, performance, drama, or tragedy, called</hi> MADRIGAL <hi>and</hi><note n="*" place="foot">See Note 1. in the First Act.</note> TROLLETTA, <hi>with the prologue, epilogue, airs, odes, dirges, and all appurtenances thereunto belonging, or in any wise appertaining; to be translated, alter'd, imitated, and made fit for the</hi> English, <hi>or other stage, by him the said</hi> JOSEPH REED. <hi>I also will and require that the profits, arising from the publication, or theatrical exhibition of the said tragedy, be applied and issued to, and for the sole use, interest, behalf, ad-vantage, and emolument of him the said</hi> JOSEPH REED, <hi>his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns; only</hi> willing and requiring <hi>of him the said</hi> JOSEPH REED, <hi>after such translation, alteration, or imitation is compleated, that the original</hi> at the sole expence of the said JOSEPH REED, <hi>may be sent to the</hi> Vatican <hi>library at</hi> Rome, <hi>to be there preserv'd as a perpetual monument of my dramatic genius.</hi></p>
<p>I have given this extract to prove my legal title to the Piece; for I must confess, not withstanding that clause in the <hi>bard's</hi> MAGNA CHARTA, call'd <hi>poetica licentia,</hi> I think it little less than downright robbery, to raise any considerable sum from the translation, or alteration of the works of an <hi>exotic</hi> brother, unless such brother, or his descendents, be admitted to go snacks in the profits. I could wish that Mr. POPE had been of my opinion in this particular, but am sorry to tell the world he <hi>was not,</hi> which I think no small blemish in his character. It is universally known this great, tho' little man, pocketed <hi>some thousands</hi> by his translation of the works of MEONIDAS HOMER, <abbr>Esq</abbr> one of the <hi>fine old Grecians;</hi> yet I could never learn (though I have made very strict enquiry) that he had the gratitude or good manners, to send even a bill of exchange, or bank note of a cool hundred, to any of Mr. HOMER'S lineal descendents. I am aware that some of Mr. POPE'S advocates will be ready to bellow out, <hi>Zounds! the fellow's mad! Where the devil could be find such descendents?</hi> ‚Äî But pray, gentlemen, why did not your admir'd <hi>little friend</hi> advertise in all the public papers in <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> to effect such discovery? Instead of
<pb n="v" facs="5"/>this, I could never find he advertis'd at all. ‚Äî Had he but even issued out a notice to that purpose in our <hi>Daily Advertiser only,</hi> I make no doubt but he would have had, within eight and forty hours of the publication, one or more claimants, who would have proved their lineal descent <hi>upon oath,</hi> which I think is as much satisfaction, as any reasonable person, who is not a downright infidel, would require. ‚Äî But to return to my subject.</p>
<p>If it be plagiarism, without benefit of clergy, to borrow a few lines from a native author, it is certainly as criminal to steal whole plays from a foreigner. ‚Äî When I reflect on the prevalency of this iniquitous practice, I am ready to fall down on my <hi>marrowbones,</hi> to return my humble and hearty thanks to goddess NATURE, for so kindly disqualifying me for the perpetration of such offence, by giving me the knowledge <hi>of one language only</hi> ‚Äî The filching of plays, under cover of translation, heaven knows, is a crime of no short standing ‚Äî Nay, some of our countrymen have carried their villainy to a yet greater height, and stole plays with little or no alteration at all. Among these abandon'd plagiaries, I am told, was AARON HILL, <abbr>Esq</abbr> <hi>of turgid, altering, and translating memory.</hi> I have heard a report of his <hi>borrowing</hi> the tragedy of ZARA; and, as the story is in few hands, I shall, by way of secret, give it to my readers; at the same time most earnestly conjuring and requiring my said readers that it <hi>may go no further;</hi> for I would not be known to propagate any rumour, to the disadvantage of an author, for whose memory I have so profound a veneration.</p>
<p>In the year one thousand seven hundred and ‚Äî I have forgot what ‚Äî Mr. THOMAS HUDSON, then an usher to a grammar-school at <hi>Durham,</hi> now a clergyman in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> translated Mons. VOLTAIRE'S <hi>Zaire.</hi> On sending such translation to <hi>London,</hi> for the perusal and examination of some connoissieur in drama, it unfortunately fell into the hands of a considerable dealer in hats: this <hi>beaverite</hi> having a more delicate taste in the <hi>outside,</hi> than <hi>inside</hi> ornaments of a <hi>head,</hi> gave the piece to a friend for such examination; by means of which friend poor Miss <hi>Zara</hi> fell into the hands of the aforesaid poetical ravisher, AARON, who
<l>Crop'd this fair rose, and rifled all its sweetness,</l>
<l>Then cast it, like a loathsome weed, away.</l>
<bibl><hi>Otway's Orph.</hi></bibl> that is, in plain prose, pilfer'd the copy; and, the better to conceal the theft, gave out that <hi>the piece was absolutely unfit for the stage;</hi> but, notwithstanding such insinuation, in that, or the following season, Miss <hi>Zara</hi> was thrown upon the town, and receiv'd with universal applause. It is true the play, <hi>in the strictest sense,</hi> could not be HUDSON'S, as HILL had misplac'd <hi>a single scene,</hi> and made the <hi>considerable</hi> alteration of <hi>fifty lines or upwards,</hi> by which the property (according to modern authors' latitudinarian notions of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum) undoubtedly</hi> became his own‚ÄîThe above anecdote I had from Mr. HUDSON; wherefore if brother AARON'S
<pb n="vi" facs="6"/>ghost know it to be a fib, I humbly desire the said ghost to take a trip into the <hi>north,</hi> and confront the sermonizer. I shall not pretend to ascertain the truth of this charge, but only offer, as my private opinion, <hi>on the side of the church,</hi> that the stiles of the <hi>English Zara</hi> and <hi>Merope,</hi> (both the same author's in <hi>French)</hi> are almost as different, as those of <hi>Jane Shore</hi> and <hi>Irene.</hi></p>
<p>After this digression, I shall lay before the public my embarrassments concerning this tragedy. Signior DELL'ARUNDO had unfortunately forgot, that his <hi>most dear friend</hi> understood no human language but that of his mother tongue: however, that no pains might be wanting, on my side, to do as much honour as I could to the production of my deceased brother, I got one of the <hi>Opera-Translators</hi> to give me the piece in <hi>English;</hi> but alas! the version was <hi>so very sublime,</hi> that I could not possibly understand any three lines of it together. After this I employ'd my friend, PETER RONE, professor of languages, to give me a literal translation, which answer'd my purpose so well, that I was able to trace many of the beauties, our foreigner had borrow'd from the <hi>English</hi> playwrights. Where the context would allow, I have given the many <hi>striking</hi> passages in the very dress of the respective authors, from whom they were undoubtedly borrow'd: where the text would not allow me such passages in the very words, I have by parody, or imitation, kept as near the <hi>sublime originals</hi> as I possibly could.</p>
<p>Signior DELL'ARUNDO, in a codicil to his will, hath also left me, subject to the aforesaid conditions, the farther legacy of three plays, viz. one Comedy and two Tragedies, called the <hi>Contrast,</hi> the <hi>Distress'd Princess,</hi> and the <hi>Distress'd Wife.</hi> The Comedy is thought to be a tolerable piece; but as to the Tragedies, I must own I think them greatly inferior to the following work. They have no <hi>triumphal entries,</hi> ROMAN <hi>ovations, sacrifices, dirges, processions, ghosts, drums, trumpets, thunder, lightning, battles, miraculous revolutions</hi> (so necessary, according to Mr. BAYES'S rule, to ELEVATE and SURPRIZE) or any of that <hi>sublime rant,</hi> which may be call'd the very soul of modern tragedy. In short, they have nothing but nature, propriety, and simplicity of fable and diction to recommend them. I have been advis'd to lard them plentifully with the above <hi>tragic artillery;</hi> but, so deprav'd is my taste, that I cannot listen to such innovation: I rather chuse to wait till <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>common sense</hi> come into play again on the <hi>British</hi> stage. In the mean time, if the town have a desire to see the theatrical exhibition of the said pieces; and the said town can or will raise me a patron, that hath influence sufficient to procure their representation, <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> of the said pieces shall be at the service of the public in the ensuing season.</p>
<p>That nothing might be wanting to render the following production as entertaining as possible, I have prevailed on my learned and ingenious friend, Dr. HUMBUG, to assist me in writing annotations to the piece.</p>
<p><pb n="vii" facs="7"/>I can hardly conclude this preface, without an intimation of the excellency of Mr. DAVIS in the character of BUCKRAMO. I hope his <hi>voice, figure</hi> and <hi>abilities for the stage</hi> will, in the ensuing season, intitle him to the regard of the Public on a PATENT THEATRE.</p>

<head><note n="1" place="foot">In the original it is <hi>Madrigal</hi> and <hi>Trolleta.</hi> As sound may be reckon'd among the primary beauties of the <hi>Italian</hi> drama, I am almost persuaded our author fix'd on TROLLETTA, to render the name of his heroine more musical and harmonious. A <hi>British</hi> author should prefer sense to sound; wherefore I have, by the alteration of a single letter, made it <hi>Trulletta;</hi> the force, the significancy, and the propriety of which name, will be obvious to the most illiterate <hi>English</hi> reader.

<l><note n="2" place="foot">In the first six lines of this tragedy, our author seems to have had his eye on the beginning of the 3d act of <hi>Cato,</hi> viz.
<l>Thanks to my stars, I have not rang'd about</l>
<l>The wilds of life, e'er I could find a friend</l>
<l>Nature first pointed out my <hi>Portius</hi> to me,</l>

<l>To love thy person, e'er I knew thy merit;</l>
<l>Till what was instinct grew up into friendship.</l> Which lines, tho' extremely beautiful, are far short of the sublimity of our author.
<p>Instead of <hi>thanking his stars,</hi> which is the hackney'd phrase of every mechanic, and <hi>nature pointing out,</hi> he puts into BUBKRAMO'S mouth,
<l>Thanks to all-bounteous fate, whose index hand</l>
<l>Hath pointed out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi></l> which undoubtedly is more pompous and sublime.

<l><note n="15" place="foot">The simplicity, beauty, and propriety of this thought cannot be sufficiently admired. Some criticks may possibly disbelieve the story of the <hi>wand'ring Jew;</hi> but that does not at all affect our author in the choice of this image, since fiction, as well as fact, is allowable in poetry. Our Bard liv'd in a country where tradition had greater weight, than in this infidel island. But that our author may not be suppos'd to have taken this image from tradition only, I can assure the world I have seen several editions of the history of this remarkable traveller, and could produce a hundred gentlemen of veracity to attest the like; and as none of our criticks have yet shewn the falsity of such history, it is to me a sufficient proof that there was, is, and must be such a person as the <hi>wand'ring Jew.</hi>
<p>A certain modern author hath intimated the image is too low for the dignity of tragedy, and advised the following alternation, viz.
<l>For sure the sun, in his diurnal round,</l>
<l>Nor moon, nor stars, e'er saw a form so fair ‚Äî</l> but I would ask the judicious reader, whether, according to our present knowledge of the heavenly bodies, it would not be downright nonsense to talk of the sun, moon, or stars <hi>seeing a form so fair.</hi> Several dramatic authors make no scruple of affirming these bodies are capable of vision, and among the rest the ingenious Mr. ROWE; who says,
<l>‚Äî if only</l>
<l>The midnight moon, and silent stars had seen it.</l>
<bibl><hi>Fair Penitent.</hi></bibl> but unless Mr. ROWE means the man in the moon, or the supposed inhabitants of the starry orbs <hi>seeing it,</hi> he must mean nothing at all.</p>

And eat your <hi>Marguirite</hi> with your hungry eyes. The epithet <hi>hungry</hi> is frequently used by tragic authors, which may probably be occasion'd by the hunger they so often expeperience. The sublime Mr. <hi>Banks,</hi> in his <hi>Earl of Essex,</hi> hath the elegant phrase of <hi>hungry nostrils:</hi>
<l>with hungry nostrils</l>
<l>waits for my blood,</l> which last word I am apt to imagine an error of the press: I am of opinion it ought to be read <hi>snuff,</hi> as <hi>snuff</hi> is almost the only food for the nostrils.</p>

<p>A very majestic description of murder; but rather too much on the sublime for common capacities. ‚Äî In compassion to the benighted understandings of my countrymen in general, I could with the publisher of the sublime tragedy of <hi>Merope</hi> would, in his next edition of that wonderful production, annex a glossary, that the beauties of that piece might be more universally understood, and comprehended by those, who have not had the good fortune of an academical education.</p>
<bibl>Dr. HUMBUG.</bibl></note> Was thy majestic eye-beam clos'd in gin;</l>
<l><note n="31" place="foot">In the 18th century, the inhabitants of <hi>Great Britain</hi> were very much addicted to drinking a liquid, call'd <hi>Geneva;</hi> or, according to its usual abbreviation, <hi>gin,</hi> which was a slow, but sure poison. They swallow'd it, as the <hi>Turks</hi> do opium, meerly for the sake of intoxication. The consumption of this liquid was so great, that some thousands of <hi>poisoners general,</hi> distinguish'd by the <hi>modest</hi> appellation of <hi>distillers,</hi> got their livelihood; nay, some of them amass'd immense fortunes by the composition of this inebriating spirit. So great was the skill of these chymical poisoners, that they could extract this intoxicating liquor from molosses, juniper-berries, turpentine; nay, I believe, had they set about it, from the upper leathers of old shoes; but the chief, and most benefical principles, from which they could possibly draw this fatal juice, were wheat, barley, or other grain. In the years 1757 and 1758, on account of the real, or artificial scarcity of grain in <hi>England,</hi> these gentry were prohibited the use of it, which so affected the distillery, that, happily for the nation, several of its professors were obliged to leave off their pernicious trades, and launch into less destructive callings. During such prohibition it was remark'd, that human excrement, both <hi>a priori</hi> and <hi>a posteriori</hi> bore an advanced price, which might probably arise from the use of these fragrant materials in distillery. This conjecture is not at all unnatural, as <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>porter,</hi> after they have undergone the internal operations, must still retain some remaining part of their <hi>wheaten</hi> and <hi>malten</hi> qualities. For my part, I am almost confirm'd in this opinion, from the near analogy of flavour between <hi>gin,</hi> and that more <hi>solid</hi> species of excrement, on which the <hi>honour of knighthood</hi> hath been time immemorial conferr'd. After so long a note, it will be almost unnecessary to prove the truth and propriety of our author's stiling <hi>gin,</hi> the <hi>bliss and bane of human life;</hi> especially as drunkenness seems to be the primary happiness of the present age.

<l>HEaven's! 'tis a fearful night!<note n="1" place="foot">Many of our tragic authors have judiciously usher'd in a dreadful night, by way of prologue or preparative to the catastrophe of their plays. Such preparative seldom fails of success, as it throws a gloomy melancholy o'er the mind, and renders the reader, or audience, more susceptible of the ensuing distress of the performance. It further serves to heighten the character of the hero, or heroine; for certainly nothing can be a stronger proof of the dignity and importance of any personage, than when we are convinced, that even nature itself is mourning the impending fall of her favourites.</note></l>

<p>The word <hi>snow'd,</hi> in the sense now implied, is a favourite metaphor with a variety of authors; yet I am of opinion the thought would be mended, if it were chang'd to <hi>hail'd.</hi></p></note></l>

Methinks I hear him exulting to the following effect. ‚Äî I thought I should catch our author tripping! A few lines ago he tells us it was a very dark night; and yet and old woman of <hi>sixty,</hi> whose sight we may naturally imagine to be none of the best, is able to discern with the naked eye such minute objects as bodkins and inkhorns in the air. To such critick I shall reply, <hi>and pray what is there unnatural in all this? Might not the light'ning enable our matron to make such discovery? Tho' her eyes were none of the best, yet she might discern these objects through ber spectacles; nay, possibly, thro' a telescope. But pray, Sir, who inform'd you of the size of bodkins and inkhorns, which you arbitrarily call such minute objects? Not our author I'm confident. For any thing you know to the contrary, they might be as large as a maypole; nay, as the Monument itself. In short, Sir, if you know any thing of the figure</hi> HYPERBOLE, <hi>which every author hath a right to use, you would have been silent on this occasion. ‚Äî Besides, with all your sagacity, you cannot even tell whether</hi> SCOURELLA <hi>really saw them or no; from the relation she gives, she may be as naturally suppos'd to have taken the account from those that had seen them, as that she had seen them herself, for it is no uncommon thing now-a-days to see with other people's eyes.</hi>

<bibl><hi>Macbeth.</hi></bibl>
<p>As I intend in a few months to give the world a compleat edition of SHAKESPEAR'S works, in twenty volumes in folio, it may not, in this place, be amiss to give a specimen of my critical abilities. My 475th note on the tragedy of <hi>Macbeth</hi> runs thus:
<quote>Though all the stream of editions concur in reading,
<l>Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edgr,</l>
<l>I'll sheath again undeeded. ‚Äî</l>
yet I am persuaded our immortal poet, who never wrote a line of fustian in his life, could not be guilty of such a turgid expression. I shall therefore propose three several readings, one of which our poet certainly wrote:
1. <l>Or else my sword with an <hi>unspatter'd</hi> edge,</l>
<l>I'll sheath again <hi>unspeeded.</hi>‚Äî</l>
as if he had said, <hi>or else my sword, with edge</hi> unsprinkled, <hi>or</hi> unsmear'd, <hi>with human gore, I'll sheath again</hi> unspeeded, <hi>i. e.</hi> unsuccessful.
2. <l>Or else my sword, with an <hi>unbattled</hi> edge,</l>
<l>I'll sheath again <hi>unbleeded ‚Äî that is,</hi> unbloody.</l>
3. <l>Or else my sword, with <hi>man-unbatten'd</hi> edge,</l>
<l>I'll sheath again <hi>in dead hide.</hi> ‚Äî</l>
q. d. <hi>or else my sword, with edge</hi> unbatten'd, <hi>or</hi> unfatten'd with man, <hi>or</hi> the blood of man, <hi>I'll sheath again</hi> in dead hide; that is, in the scabbard. To illustrate this image more fully, it may not be amiss to add, that scabbards are generally made of <hi>dead hides,</hi> or leather. I am apt to think, from the analogy of sound between <hi>in dead hide,</hi> and <hi>undeeded,</hi> that such corruption hath crept into the text.</quote> <bibl>Dr. HUMBUG.</bibl></p></note></l>

Forbids the holy rites of funeral ‚Äî on which the punning critick before-mention'd observ'd, it was an <hi>immoral</hi> play. Our author took the hint, but could not be prevailed on to annex a moral. I expostulated with him, in the most friendly manner, on the necessity of such termination of the play; but he very <hi>obstinately</hi> and <hi>whimsically</hi> insisted, that a moral, unless drawn up in the epilogue, was unnatural, because it is an immediate address to the audience; which audidience, the <hi>speaker,</hi> in his dramatic character, cannot with propriety suppose to be present ‚Äî that it could not properly be spoken by any of the persons in the drama, unless such person had been present during the whole representation, and was consequently acquainted with every incident in the play ‚Äî that it was an affront to an audience, to suppose them incapable of drawing a moral from the representation ‚Äî that it was a modern custom, and, in his opinion,
<l>More honour'd in the breach, than the observance.</l>
<bibl><hi>Hamlet.</hi></bibl> that many judicious authors had shewn their dislike of such practise, particularly GAY, who severely satiriz'd it in his ingenious and pithy epilogue to the <hi>What d'ye call it,</hi> viz.
<l>Our stage-play has a moral, and no doubt</l>
<l>You all have wit enough to find it out.</l> and finally, that our immortal SHAKESPEAR seldom or never concluded any of his plays with a moral.
<p>He was so obstinate on the occasion, that it was with no small difficuity I could prevail on him to suffer me to annex the foregoing moral; which the reader may perceive is taken, with slight alteration, from the most finish'd tragedy, that any language hath yet produced, I mean Mr. ADDISON'S <hi>Cato.</hi></p>
<p>As I have now ended my annotations, and occasionally scatter'd a few <hi>encomia</hi> on the play, it will be naturally expected I should give my summary opinion of its merits, which I shall deliver, not so much with the candour of the friend, as the impartiality of the critick. I shall divide the subject of my remarks into three heads, viz. the fable, the manners, and the diction.</p>
<p>As to the fable ‚Äî but it had quite slipt my memory, that the printer's boy hath been waiting this half hour at my elbow for the finishing note, wherefore I must defer my criticism, till the next edition of this tragedy.</p>
