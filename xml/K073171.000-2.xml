<p>MARCELLA; A TRAGEDY, OF THREE ACTS.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="preface">
<pb facs="107"/>
<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>THE following Tragedy may perhaps attract the notice of the curious reader, more by a literary anecdote relating to its subject, than by any intrinsic merit as a dramatic composition.</p>
<p>The story was recommended to YOUNG by the Author of Clarissa.—The poet adopted it, and wrote a single act; but this shared the fate of his other unfinished manuscripts, and, according to the direction of his will, was committed to the flames.</p>
<p>These particulars, with a concise sketch of the story as related by RICHARDSON, were communicated to Mr. THORNTON by the poet's very liberal and amiable Son, the neighbour and the much-esteemed relation of my dear departed friend, who wished me to build a tragedy upon this foundation.</p>
<p>Some particular circumstances prevented me at that time from executing the desire of a person, who, from the integrity of his judgment, and the uncommon warmth
<pb n="96" facs="108"/>
of his friendship, had an undisputed title to influence my studies.—Other works had engaged me, and this dramatic story lay for some years neglected: but in looking over the letters of my still-valued, though lost correspondent, it struck me with new force. As the distress, with which it abounds, is of a private nature, it appeared to me singularly calculated for my purpose of forming a drama for a domestic theatre. I have therefore, with some considerable alterations in the principal incident, raised from it a tragedy of three acts; with what success, it is now the privilege of my readers to pronounce.</p>
<p>I will not attempt to influence their decision by any arguments in its behalf; but let me be allowed to close this short preface with a little poetical acknowledgment to the two literary illustrious friends, who first marked the story for the tragic Muse, and from whom it has accidentally descended to me.</p>

<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>LET ardent friendship be the bond between us,</l>
<l>But O subdue this inauspicious love,</l>
<l>And chace it from thy breast!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Impossible!</l>
<l>Think, cruel monitor, thro' what long years</l>
<l>My heart has cherish'd an encreasing passion,</l>
<l>Till it is grown a portion of my being,</l>
<l>Which I can ne'er relinquish but with life!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="100" facs="112"/>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>I know, that from our days of infancy</l>
<l>Thy vows have had the sanction of my father;</l>
<l>And from the period when he first became</l>
<l>The governor of this fair city, he</l>
<l>Has lean'd towards thee with an anxious hope</l>
<l>To call thee by the tender name of son:</l>
<l>Nor can the world reprove his generous wishes,</l>
<l>For Barcelona's walls contain no youth</l>
<l>Of nobler blood, or higher estimation.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Lovely encomiast! sure the songs of seraphs,</l>
<l>And all the wondrous harmonies of Heaven,</l>
<l>Can never strike more sweetly on the soul,</l>
<l>Than the frank praise of those angelic lips.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>I should despise my own uncandid heart,</l>
<l>If it refus'd that tribute of applause</l>
<l>Which selfish pride, and jealous envy pay</l>
<l>To thy acknowledg'd merit.—Yes! Lupercio,</l>
<l>I own, thy rank, and thy accomplish'd youth,</l>
<l>Might justly challenge a return of fondness</l>
<l><pb n="101" facs="113"/>From the most haughty of our flatter'd sex;</l>
<l>Yet trust me, and I speak the words of friendship,</l>
<l>'Twere wiser in thee, even could my tongue</l>
<l>Pronounce the free compliance thou entreatest,</l>
<l>To turn thy partial eyes from cold Marcella,</l>
<l>And for thy wife solicit me no more.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Mock not my senses with such admonition</l>
<l>As reason must revolt from! Wouldst thou say</l>
<l>To the poor wretch, who after many a step</l>
<l>O'er Afric's burning sands, half dead with drought,</l>
<l>Holds in his parch'd and eager hand at last</l>
<l>The liquid blessing, that he long has pin'd for;</l>
<l>Then wouldst thou say, that wisdom bids him dash</l>
<l>The salutary treasure from his tongue,</l>
<l>And perish by the thirst that wastes his being?</l>
<l>Such, and more cruel is thy counsel now,</l>
<l>That would induce me to renounce thy charms,</l>
<l>E'en in these moments, when thy father's friendship</l>
<l>Had fill'd my soul with panting expectation</l>
<l>To hear thy heavenly voice declare me happy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="102" facs="114"/>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>I know my father's hopes; and by his worth</l>
<l>I swear, my heart oft wishes for the power</l>
<l>Most fondly to fulfil them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Ha! what bar,</l>
<l>What secret bar, from quick-ey'd Love conceal'd,</l>
<l>Has envious fortune rais'd to thwart our union?</l>
<l>You say, that you regard me as your friend;</l>
<l>Then honour me with friendship's dearest claim,</l>
<l>Unbounded confidence!—unfold your heart!—</l>
<l>If, to cut off the promise of my bliss,</l>
<l>If there is aught of unknown fondness there,</l>
<l>Which fears a father's eye, confide in me!</l>
<l>And though against myself—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>Ingenuous youth!</l>
<l>Your mind is noble, but you little know</l>
<l>Marcella's heart, above all low disguise,</l>
<l>Proud of its truth, nor patient of controul.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Pardon the fond surmise of fearful love!</l>
<l><pb n="103" facs="115"/>If thy soft breast is free from predilection,</l>
<l>What other bar?—and yet there may be other;</l>
<l>Nature perhaps has curs'd me with defects</l>
<l>Offensive to thy sight; some natural blemish</l>
<l>Of mind, or feature, which thy delicate sense</l>
<l>Tries to endure, but cannot.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>No! by Heaven!</l>
<l>Except the noble stranger, whom we saw</l>
<l>At mass this morning, and whose signal graces</l>
<l>Drew from us both observance of his person,</l>
<l>My eyes ne'er gaz'd upon a comelier youth:</l>
<l>And reason tells me, that I ought to love thee:</l>
<l>But my heart shrinks perversely from her voice.</l>
<l>Oft have I try'd to bend my wayward spirit</l>
<l>To crown thy constant vows, and bless my father;</l>
<l>Yet ever as my soul pursues that thought,</l>
<l>A secret tremor in my bosom bids me</l>
<l>Recoil from thy embraces, whispering there,</l>
<l>That I was only born to be thy bane.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Thou! thou my bane!—Thou art my life's support;</l>
<l><pb n="104" facs="116"/>As dear, and as essential to my being,</l>
<l>As the blest radiance of the sun to nature.</l>
<l>These are the airy fears of virgin softness,</l>
<l>Most apt to harbour in the loveliest minds.</l>
<l>Banish the visionary dread, and give</l>
<l>Thy lighten'd heart to all the joys that court thee!</l>
<l>Thy father's prayers, the vows of all our friends</l>
<l>Will shed propitious lustre on our union:</l>
<l>Hymen can never light his genial flame</l>
<l>With happier auspices; but were they dark</l>
<l>And hideous as the sick man's feverish dreams;</l>
<l>Wert thou, instead of noble Garcia's heiress,</l>
<l>The child of want, and penury thy dower,</l>
<l>I still should pant as fondly for thy hand;</l>
<l>Still in thy wondrous charms and lovely virtues</l>
<l>Think all the blessings of the earth compriz'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>I know thee generous to a fond extreme:</l>
<l>It has subdu'd my waywardness of temper,</l>
<l>And, spite of the reluctance that I feel</l>
<l>To speak the important words, I will be thine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="105" facs="117"/>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Blest be that sound! it is an angel's voice,</l>
<l>Freeing the spirit of a tortur'd martyr,</l>
<l>And opening to his view the heaven he sigh'd for.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>And yet I fear—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Wound not enraptur'd love</l>
<l>With vain distrust! but name the blissful day,</l>
<l>When my fond heart—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>I said, I will be thine:</l>
<l>Do not, with cruel importunity,</l>
<l>Now press me farther! As I frankly told thee,</l>
<l>My soul, I know not why, is out of tune;</l>
<l>Give me a little time to regulate</l>
<l>The strange emotion of my mind, and try</l>
<l>To meet thee, as I wish, without these terrors.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Thou dear directress of my fate! thy will</l>
<l>Shall ever sway the conduct of my life,</l>
<l>Howe'er it thwart me.—Yet, I pray thee, name</l>
<l><pb n="106" facs="118"/>Some period, on which hope may dwell, to sooth</l>
<l>The restless interval! or kindly give me</l>
<l>Some pledge of thy dear promise!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>Take this ring,</l>
<l>Of curious workmanship, near Tunis found,</l>
<l>And given my father by a noble Moor;</l>
<l>The wife of Asdrubal, you know the figure,</l>
<l>Plunging amidst the flames, in which she perish'd!</l>
<l>Wear this a month, then claim me as your bride!</l>
<l>But if you value me, preserve the jewel;</l>
<l>For if you lose this symbol of my faith,</l>
<l>Your negligence may lead me to retract</l>
<l>A promise, so reluctantly pronounc'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Rest here, thou radiant harbinger of bliss!</l>
<l>Trust me, my love, and by thyself I swear,</l>
<l>That sooner shall my soul and body part,</l>
<l>Than this dear gem be wrested from the finger</l>
<l>Where now it shines.—O let me kiss the hand</l>
<l>Which has enrich'd me with a pledge so precious;</l>
<l>And let my lips thus ratify our compact!</l>
<stage>While he is kissing her hand,</stage>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="107" facs="119"/><hi>Enter the</hi> Governor, Hernandez, <hi>and a female Attendant.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>Why, this is well: I like this pleasing shew</l>
<l>Of mutual tenderness—She has relented,</l>
<l>And will be your's, Lupercio?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Yes, my father,</l>
<l>I now may call you by that valued title;</l>
<l>My blissful doom has pass'd those lovely lips,</l>
<l>And she is now irrevocably mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>May every blessing my paternal prayers</l>
<l>Can ask of Heaven, descend upon ye both!</l>
<l>Thy free consent delights me; and thou art</l>
<l>My age's comfort.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>When I cease to be so,</l>
<l>May life forsake me!—'twill have lost all value.</l>

<l>My tender child, I thank thee: but thou lead'st me</l>
<l>Wide of my present aim.—With thee, Lupercio,</l>
<l><pb n="108" facs="120"/>I must on business of the state awhile</l>
<l>Hold private converse: I'll release thee soon</l>
<l>To the soft object of thy tend'rer thoughts.</l>
<l>Meantime, my daughter, as the hour of vespers</l>
<l>Now summons you, pray for us, and implore</l>
<l>Your Guardian Saint to make your nuptials happy.</l>
<l>Your servants wait you—Go!—on your return</l>
<l>You'll find us in the castle, and at leisure</l>
<l>To dedicate the hours to love and joy.—</l>

<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>Hernandez, you may rest at home—you know</l>
<l>'Tis not your duty to attend on me,</l>
<l>As I have oft inform'd you.—It is strange</l>
<l>My father suffers his old foolish steward</l>
<l>To pester me with such officious service.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERNANDEZ.</speaker>
<l>Dear lady, do not frown—I have no joy</l>
<l>But to gaze on you, wheresoe'er you go,</l>
<l>And follow like your shadow.—Would my shape</l>
<l><pb n="109" facs="121"/>Were half so graceful!—then I think your eyes</l>
<l>Could never view me with an angry glance.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>Hence, saucy vassal!—Howsoe'er my father</l>
<l>Use thy preposterous passion for his mirth,</l>

<l>Away! fantastic insolence! be gone!</l>
<l>I will not feed thy vanity, by wearing</l>

<l>How now, Hernandez!</l>
<l>What! has your mistress chid you from her presence?</l>
<l>I am indeed to blame, to treat so long</l>
<l>Your fooleries with levity and laughter.</l>
<l>Henceforth, in this my young and noble friend</l>
<l>You must respect a husband's dignity,</l>
<l>And dare to wound my daughter's ear no more</l>
<l>With sounds of amorous dotage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Good Hernandez,</l>
<l>You know the infirmity of Spanish husbands;</l>
<l>And you're so studied in your lady's temper,</l>
<l>I may regard you as a dangerous rival.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERNANDEZ.</speaker>
<l>I stand corrected.—
<stage>(<hi>Aside.</hi>)</stage>
Curse his happy stars!</l>
<l>And curse his proud and thinly-veil'd contempt!</l>
<l>Howe'er deformity may make my figure</l>
<l>The butt of his derision, I've a spirit,</l>
<l><pb n="111" facs="123"/>In which this fair-limb'd youth may feel a rival</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>That faithful servant is depriv'd of sense</l>
<l>By the absurdest passion that e'er triumph'd</l>
<l>O'er manly reason: he was justly noted</l>
<l>For the best qualities that grace his station,</l>
<l>Intelligence and duty, till my daughter</l>
<l>Advanc'd to womanhood; but from that period,</l>
<l>E'en in proportion as her beauties ripen'd,</l>
<l>His faculties have seem'd upon the wane.</l>
<l>I have too lightly sported with his frenzy,</l>
<l>Which call'd for harsher discipline.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>O! no,</l>
<l>I feel he is entitled to compassion;</l>
<l>Marcella has those fascinating charms,</l>
<l>Which may intoxicate the soberest mind,</l>
<l>Till all its senses reel.—I cannot wonder</l>
<l>Age and deformity forget their nature</l>
<l>By living in her sight, and only feel</l>
<l>That she has beauty which inflames to madness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>She may indeed (with pride the father speaks it)</l>
<l>Be number'd with the loveliest of her sex.</l>
<l>With joy, brave youth, but with an anxious joy,</l>
<l>I give her to thy guard.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Doubt not my love!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>Trust me, I do not: but anxiety</l>
<l>Is the high tax, which fond affection pays</l>
<l>For all its pleasures; and parental hearts,</l>
<l>As thou may'st prove hereafter, pay it double.</l>
<l>Besides, my daughter, lovely as she is,</l>
<l>Has qualities that claim the nicest care.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>She has a generous pride, which to her soul</l>
<l>Gives awful beauty, and proclaims it free</l>
<l>From all that poor and petty artifice,</l>
<l>Which manly arrogance presumes to think</l>
<l>Inherent in her sex.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>You know, Lupercio,</l>
<l><pb n="113" facs="125"/>She is the only child that ever nature</l>
<l>Enrich'd me with; my tenderness, disdaining</l>
<l>The rigid customs of her sex and country,</l>
<l>Has rear'd her with a freedom little known</l>
<l>To Spanish fair-ones; for I wish'd to make her,</l>
<l>Not the cag'd vassal of parental power,</l>
<l>But truth and nature's chaste and free disciple.</l>
<l>Her early temper join'd with my affection</l>
<l>To fix me in this conduct; for, believe me,</l>
<l>Her mind is like the element of fire;</l>
<l>Treat it with gentle caution, it will shine</l>
<l>The radiant minister of joy and comfort;</l>
<l>But close confinement, or a blind neglect,</l>
<l>May rouse its perilous energies to spread</l>
<l>Unthought-of scenes of misery and terror.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Trust me, I never will prophane her virtue</l>
<l>With abject jealousy and harsh constraint.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>On this nice topic, in our hours of leisure,</l>
<l>We'll speak more largely, when your just affection</l>
<l>Will give kind audience to a father's counsel.</l>
<l><pb n="114" facs="126"/>Now other cares demand us.—You forget</l>
<l>The business I've entrusted to your guidance,</l>
<l>Which calls for quick dispatch.</l>

<speaker>LUPERCIO.</speaker>
<l>Forgive me, Sir!</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>My blessing be thy guard!—Long have I wish'd</l>
<l>To give my daughter to this virtuous youth;</l>
<l>But 'tis the doom of age, in deeds of moment,</l>
<l>To feel the fit of warm desire succeeded</l>
<l>By terror's aguish tremblings. I begin</l>

<l>To what her heart recoils from; for she weds</l>
<l>To indulge a father's wishes, not her own.</l>
<l>'Tis true, the tenderest motives have impell'd me</l>
<l>To urge this union, eager to entrust</l>
<l>Her peace and honour to a kind protector:</l>
<l>But anxious love, tho' probity may guide it,</l>
<l>Oft, with a fond precipitancy, foils</l>
<l><pb n="115" facs="127"/>Its own dear purpose, and with dizzy rashness</l>
<l>Leaps in the dreaded gulph it strives to shun.—</l>

<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>It moves, I see, thy wonder,</l>
<l>Thou honour'd veteran, that thus uncheck'd</l>
<l>By ceremony's just observances,</l>
<l>A youth unknown intrudes upon thy presence,</l>
<l>And dares to make this lovely maid his herald.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>Whoe'er thou art, young Signor, I must own</l>
<l>Thy graceful semblance prompts me to believe</l>
<l>Thou hast no common claim to courtesy.</l>

<l>'Tis possible thou art not unacquainted</l>
<l>With young Mendoza's name.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>Who knows it not?</l>
<l>Spain has no martial son, whose generous veins</l>
<l>Hold richer blood; and fame reports Mendoza</l>
<l><pb n="116" facs="128"/>A youth, whose opening virtues have reflected</l>
<l>New honour on his noble ancestry.</l>
<l>Our country, with a fond, impatient pride,</l>
<l>Expects him from his travels; but 'tis said</l>
<l>That, grac'd with a discerning monarch's friendship,</l>
<l>He purposes to pass another year</l>
<l>At the Imperial court.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Such as he is,</l>
<l>Mendoza stands before thee, and thou seest him</l>
<l>An anxious, humble suitor to thy bounty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>To me, my Lord!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>To thee, thou happy father!</l>
<l>To thee, thou blest possessor of a treasure,</l>
<l>That turns all other wealth to poverty!</l>
<l>Oft had I heard thy lovely daughter prais'd</l>
<l>As beauty's standard, and no more allowing</l>
<l>A competition with inferior fair-ones,</l>
<l>Than the rich diamond's blaze admits compare</l>
<l>With the dark amethyst, or clouded opal.</l>
<l><pb n="117" facs="129"/>It was my wish, in passing thro' your city,</l>
<l>Unknown to gaze upon this beauteous wonder,</l>
<l>As on a prodigy of nature's work,</l>
<l>Supreme in loveliness; which to have seen,</l>
<l>Gives to the eye that saw it a proud sparkle</l>
<l>Of exultation, whensoe'er 'tis nam'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>This lavish praise, my Lord, at once o'erwhelms me</l>
<l>With joy and pain; and both in the extreme.</l>

<l>The simple charms of an unpolish'd girl!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Your pardon!—'tis not in the power of language</l>
<l>To state their excellence.—At mass this morning</l>
<l>My eager eyes first feasted on their sight:</l>
<l>I thought I ne'er had seen till that blest moment;</l>
<l>For on my ravish'd sense her beauty burst,</l>
<l>Dazzling and dear, as new-imparted light</l>
<l>To one, whose visual organs from his childhood</l>
<l>Had pin'd in moping darkness—from that hour</l>
<l>My heart cries loudly, that the earth contains</l>
<l>No prize worth my contention, but her love.—</l>
<l><pb n="118" facs="130"/>Report inform'd me, that her soft affections</l>
<l>Are yet unfix'd; tho' an accomplish'd youth,</l>
<l>Fondly presuming on a father's friendship,</l>
<l>Hopes hourly for the promise of her hand.</l>
<l>Fir'd by these tidings, as again I saw her</l>
<l>Approach the hallow'd precincts of the temple,</l>
<l>I threw me at her feet, conjur'd her pity</l>
<l>To guide me to your presence, and implor'd</l>
<l>The Guardian Saint, whose votary I sued to,</l>
<l>That when we next that sacred pavement trod,</l>
<l>Heaven might exalt me to the blissful honour</l>
<l>To lead her to the altar.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARCELLA.</speaker>
<l>Oft in vain</l>
<l>I pray'd the gallant stranger to forbear</l>
<l>His unavailing suit, nor vex my father</l>
<l>With fruitless importunity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>To both</l>
<l>I bend for pardon, that my violent love</l>
<l>Dar'd to o'er-rule the mortifying counsel</l>
<l>Of maidenly reserve, and modest fear.</l>
<l><pb n="119" facs="131"/>If yet thy heart, that throne of happiness,</l>
<l>Be vacant, I implore thy father's leave</l>
<l>To join the contest for a prize, whose value</l>
<l>Might tempt the monarchs of the world in arms</l>
<l>To hazard each his empire.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>Noble youth!</l>
<l>Thy generous warmth so wins on my esteem,</l>
<l>I will entrust thy own ingenuous heart</l>
<l>To judge the cause, where e'en thy love's a party.</l>
<l>The hour's not past, in which, with her assent,</l>
<l>I gave my daughter to a valiant friend,</l>
<l>Who long has lov'd her; tho' I frankly own</l>
<l>His birth and fortune make him not thy equal.</l>
<l>Such is my story: now assume my place,</l>
<l>And answer for me! Say! shall I, a soldier,</l>
<l>An old plain soldier, honesty my pride!</l>
<l>Shall I revoke my promise, at the lure</l>
<l>Of interest and ambition?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MENDOZA.</speaker>
<l>Thou hast found</l>
<l>The way to vanquish all Mendoza's ardour:</l>
<l><pb n="120" facs="132"/>Thy words benumb my soul; but thou shalt see</l>
<l>My wounded heart has virtue to decide</l>
<l>Against itself. Mendoza's voice shall never</l>
<l>Prompt to the lips of honourable age</l>
<l>The abject sounds of infamy.—Shalt thou</l>
<l>Revoke thy promise! no! thou brave old man,</l>
<l>Not tho' my life should end by its completion!</l>
<l>Let the vain sons of Italy and France</l>
<l>Attempt, by mental alchemy, to turn</l>
<l>The lead of falshood into wisdom's gold,</l>
<l>And sink, their own poor bubbles, in the trial!</l>
<l>It is the glory of a true Castilian</l>
<l>To scorn such arts, and hold his word once given</l>
<l>As sacred as the fiat of a God.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GOVERNOR.</speaker>
<l>There spoke the spirit of Castilian honour.</l>
<l>Brave youth! I yet will love thee as my son,</l>
<l>Tho' fate forbid such union.—Let us hence,</l>
<l>It may amuse thy generous mind to shew thee</l>
<l>The precincts of our castle.</l>

<l>I must perforce from thy enchanting presence</l>
<l>Tear my reluctant heart, while yet I can;</l>
<l>Before the firm resolve of honour melts</l>
<l>In that full blaze of frenzy-kindling beauty.</l>
<l>I go:—Still, ere I quit these walls for ever,</l>
<l>I shall implore one parting interview;</l>
<l>But for a few short moments, but to utter</l>
<l>My ardent vows, that Heaven may make thee happy;</l>
<l>And to entreat, that as the years roll on,</l>
<l>And bring thee, as I hope they will, new blessings,</l>
