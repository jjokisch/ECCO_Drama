<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<byline>Written by a FRIEND.</byline>
<l>TOO long has Farce, neglecting Nature's Laws,</l>
<l>Debas'd the Stage, and wrong'd the Comic Cause:</l>
<l>To raise a Laugh has been her sole Pretence,</l>
<l>Tho' dearly purchas'd at the Price of Sense;</l>
<l>This Child of Folly gain'd Increase with Time;</l>
<l>Fit for the Place, succeeded <hi>Pantomime;</hi></l>
<l>Reviv'd her Honours, join'd her motley Band,</l>
<l>And Song, and low Conceit, o'er-ran the Land.</l>
<l>More gen'rous Views inform our Author's Breast,</l>
<l>From real Life his Characters are drest;</l>
<l>He seeks to trace the Passions of Mankind,</l>
<l>And while he spares the Person, paints the Mind.</l>
<l>In pleasing Contrast he attempts to show</l>
<l>The vap'ring Bully, and the frib'ling Beau,</l>
<l>Cowards alike, That full of Martial Airs,</l>
<l>And This as tender as the Silk he wears.</l>
<l>Proud to divert, not anxious for Renown,</l>
<l>Oft has the Bard essay'd to please the Town,</l>
<l>Your full Applause out-paid his little Art,</l>
<l>He boasts no Merit, but a grateful Heart;</l>
<l>Pronounce your Doom, he'll patiently submit,</l>
<l>Ye sovereign Judges of all Works of Wit!</l>
<l>To you the Ore is brought, a lifeless Mass,</l>
<l>You give the Stamp, and then the Coin may pass.</l>
<l>Now whether Judgment prompt you to forgive,</l>
<l>Whether you bid this trifling Offspring live,</l>
<l>Or with a Frown should send the sickly Thing,</l>
<l>To sleep whole Ages under Dulness' Wing;</l>
<l>To your known Candour we will always trust,</l>
<l>You never were, nor can you be unjust.</l>

<head>ACT I. SCENE I.</head>
<head>SCENE, <stage>A STREET.</stage></head>
<stage>Enter Captain <hi>LOVEIT</hi> and <hi>PUFF.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>CAPTAIN.</speaker>
<p>THIS is the Place we were directed to; and now,
<hi>Puff,</hi> if I can get no Intelligence of her, what will
become of me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>And me too, Sir.—You must consider I am
a marry'd Man, and can't bear Fatigue as I have done.—But pray, Sir, why did you leave the Army so abruptly,
and not give me Time to fill my Knapsack with common
Necessaries? Half a Dozen Shirts, and your Regimentals,
are my whole Cargo.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>I was wild to get away, and as soon as I obtain'd
my Leave of Absence, I thought every Moment an Age
till I return'd to the Place where I first saw this young-charming,
innocent, bewitching Creature—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>With fifteen thousand Pounds for her Fortune—Strong Motives, I must confess.—And now, Sir, as
you are pleas'd to say you must depend upon my Care and
Abilities in this Affair, I think I have a just Right to be
acquainted with the Particulars of your Passion, that I may
be the better enabled to serve you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>You shall have 'em.—When I left the University,
which is now seven Months since, my Father, who
loves his Money better than his Son, and would not settle
a Farthing upon me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Mine did so by me, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>Purchas'd me a Pair of Colours at my own Request;
but before I join'd the Regiment, which was going
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
abroad, I took a Ramble into the Country with a Fellow-Collegian,
to see a Relation of his who liv'd in <hi>Berkshire.</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>—A Party of Pleasure, I suppose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>During a short Stay there, I came acquainted with
this young Creature; she was just come from the Boarding-School,
and tho' she had all the Simplicity of her Age and
the Country, yet it was mix'd with such sensible Vivacity,
that I took Fire at once—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>I was Tinder myself at your Age. But pray, Sir,
did you take Fire before you knew of her Fortune?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>Before, upon my Honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Folly and Constitution—But on, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>I was introduced to the Family by the Name of
<hi>Rhodophil,</hi> (for so my Companion and I had settled it;) at
the End of three Weeks I was oblig'd to attend the Call of
Honour in <hi>Flanders.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Your Parting, to be sure, was Heart-breaking.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>I feel it at this Instant.—We vow'd eternal Constancy,
and I promis'd to take the first Opportunity of returning
to her: I did so, but we found the House shut up,
and all the Information, you know, that we could get from
the neighbouring Cottage was, that Miss and her Aunt were
remov'd to Town, and liv'd somewhere near this Part of it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>And now we are got to the Place of Action, propose
your Plan of Operation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>My Father lives but in the next Street, so I must
decamp immediately for fear of Discoveries; you are not
known to be my Servant, so make what Enquiries you can
in the Neighbourhood, and I shall wait at the Inn for your
Intelligence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>I'll patrol hercabouts, and examine all that pass;
but I've forgot the Word, Sir—Miss <hi>Biddy</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>Bellair—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>A young Lady of Wit, Beauty, and Fifteen thousand
Pounds Fortune—but, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>What do you say, <hi>Puff?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>If your Honour pleases to consider that I had a
Wife in Town whom I left somewhat abruptly half a Year
ago, you'll think it, I believe, but decent, to make some
Enquiry after her first; to be sure it would be some small
Consolation to me to know whether the poor Woman is living,
or has made away with herself, or—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>Pr'ythec don't distract me; a Moment's Delay is
of the utmost Consequence; I must insist upon an immediate
Compliance with my Commands.</p>
<stage>(Exit <hi>Captain.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>The Devil's in these fiery young Fellows! they
think of no body's Wants but their own. He does not
consider that I am Flesh and Blood as well as himself. However
I may kill two Birds at once; for I shan't be surpriz'd
if I meet my Lady walking the Streets—But who have
we here? Sure I should know that Face.</p>
<stage>Enter <hi>Jasper</hi> from a House.</stage>
<p>Who's that? my old Acquaintance, <hi>Jasper!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>What, <hi>Puff!</hi> are you here?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>My dear Friend! <stage>[Kisses him.]</stage> Well, and how
<hi>Jasper,</hi> still easy and happy! <hi>Toujours le meme!</hi>—What
Intrigues now? What Girls have you ruin'd, and what
Cuckolds made, since you and I us'd to beat up together, Eh?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>Faith, Business has been very brisk during the
War; Men are scarce, you know; not that I can say I
ever wanted Amusement in the worst of Times.—But
harkye. <hi>Puff</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Not a Word aloud, I am <hi>incognito.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>Why Faith, I should not have known you, if
you had not spoke first; you seem to be a little <hi>dishabille</hi>
too, as well as <hi>incognito.</hi> Whom do you honour with your
Service now? Are you from the Wars?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Piping hot, I assure you; Fire and Smoke will tarnish;
a Man that will go into such Service as I have been
in, will find his Clothes the worse for wear, take my Word
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
for it: But how is it with you, Friend <hi>Jasper</hi>? What,
you still serve, I see? You live at that House, I suppose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>I don't absolutely live, but I am most of my
Time there; I have within these two Months enter'd into
the Service of an old Gentleman, who hired a reputable
Servant, and dress'd him as you see, because he has taken
it into his Head to fall in Love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>False Appetite and second Childhood! But pr'ythee,
what's the Object of his Passion?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>No less than a Virgin of Sixteen, I assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Oh, the toothless old Dotard!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>And he mumbles and plays with her till his
Mouth waters; then he chuckles till he cries, and calls it
his <hi>Bid,</hi> and his <hi>Bidsy,</hi> and is so foolishly fond—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p><hi>Bidsy!</hi> What's that?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>—Her Name is <hi>Biddy.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p><hi>Biddy!</hi> What, Miss <hi>Biddy Bellair</hi>?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>—The same—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>I have no Luck, to be sure. <stage>[Aside.]</stage>—Oh!
I have heard of her; she's of a pretty good Family, and
has some Fortune, I know. But are things settled? Is the
Marriage fixed?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>Not absolutely; the Girl, I believe, detests
him; but her Aunt, a very good prudent old Lady, has
given her Consent, if he can gain her Niece's; how it will
end I can't tell—but I am hot upon't myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>—The Devil! not Marriage, I hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>That is not yet determined.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Who is the Lady, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>A Maid in the same Family, a Woman of Honour,
I assure you; She has one Husband already, a scoundrel
sort of a Fellow that has run away from her, and listed
for a Soldier; so, towards the End of the Campaign, she
hopes to have a Certificate he's knock'd o' th' Head; if not,
I suppose, we shall settle Matters another way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Well, speed the Plough.—But harkye, consummate
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
without the Certificate if you can—keep your
Neck out of the Collar—do—I have wore it these two
Years, and damnably gall'd I am.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>I'll take your Advice; but I must run away to
my Master, who will be impatient for an Answer to his
Message which I have just deliver'd to the young Lady; so,
dear Mr. <hi>Puff,</hi> I am your most obedient humble Servant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>And I must to our Agent's for my Arrears: If
you have an Hour to spare, you'll hear of me at <hi>George</hi>'s
or the <hi>Tilt-Yard</hi>—<hi>Au Revoir,</hi> as we say abroad.
<stage>[Exit <hi>Jasper.</hi>]</stage> Thus we are as civil and as false as our Betters;
<hi>Jasper</hi> and I were always the <hi>Beau Monde</hi> exactly;
we ever hated one another heartily, yet always kiss, and
shake Hands—But now to my Master, with a Head full
of News, and a Heart full of Joy!</p>
<stage>[Going starts.</stage>
<l>Angels, and Ministers of Grace, defend me!</l>
<p>It can't be! by Heavens, it is, that fretful Porcupine, my
Wife! I can't stand it; what shall I do? I'll try to avoid
her.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Tag.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>It must be he! I'll swear to the Rogue at a Mile's
distance; he either has not seen me, or wont know me;
if I can keep my Temper I'll try him farther.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>I sweat—I tremble—She comes upon me!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Pray, good Sir, If I may be so bold—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>I have nothing for you, good Woman, don't
trouble me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>If your Honour pleases to look this way—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>The Kingdom is over-run with Beggars; I suppose
the last I gave to has sent this: but I have no more loose
Silver about me; so pr'ythee, Woman, don't disturb me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>I can hold no longer; oh you Villain, you! Where
have you been, Scoundrel! Do you know me now Varlet?</p>
<stage>[Seizes him.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Here Watch, Watch,—Zounds I shall have my
Pockets pick'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Own me this Minute, Hang-dog, and confess every
thing, or by the Rage of an injur'd Woman, I'll raise
the Neighbourhood, throttle you, and send you to Newgate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Amazement! what, my own dear <hi>Tag!</hi> Come
to my Arms, and let me press you to my Heart, that pants
for thee, and only thee, my true and lawful Wife.—Now
my Stars have over-paid me for the Fatigue and Dangers of
the Field; I have wander'd about like <hi>Achilles</hi> in search of
faithful <hi>Penelope,</hi> and the Gods have brought me to this
happy Spot.</p>
<stage>[Embraces her.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>The Fellow's crack'd for certain! Leave your bombastick
Stuff, and tell me, Rascal, why you left me, and
where you have been these six Months, heh?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>We'll reserve my Adventures for our happy Winter
Evenings—I shall only tell you now, that my Heart
beats so strong in my Country's Cause, and being instigated
either by Honour or the Devil, (I cannot tell which) I set
out for <hi>Flanders,</hi> to gather Lawrels, and lay 'em at thy Feet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>You left me to starve, Villain, and beg my Bread,
you did so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>I left you too hastily I must confess, and often has
my Conscience flung me for it.—I am got into an Officer's
Service, have been in several Actions, gain'd some
Credit by my Behaviour, and am now return'd with my
Master, to indulge the gender Passions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Don't think to fob me off with this nonsensical
Talk; what have you brought me home besides?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Honour, and immoderate Love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I could tear your Eyes out.</p>

<p>Temperance, or I walk off.</p>

<p>Temperance, Traitor, Temperance! What can
you say for yourself? Leave me to the wide World.—</p>

<p>Well, I have been in the wide World too, han't
I? What would the Woman have?</p>

<p>Why, I'm in Service too, your Lord and Master,
an't I, you saucy Jade, you?—Come, where dost live,
hereabouts? Hast got good Vails? Dost go to Market?
Come, give me a Kiss, Darling, and tell me where I shall
pay my Duty to thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Why, there I live at that House.</p>
<stage>[Pointing to the House <hi>Jasper</hi> come out of.</stage>

<p>Yes, there, that House.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Huzza! We're made for ever, you Slut, you!
huzza! Every thing conspires this Day to make me happy—Prepare
for an Inundation of Joy! My Master is in
love with your Miss <hi>Biddy</hi> over Head and Ears, and she
with him: I know she is courted by some old Fumbler,
and her Aunt is not against the Match; but now we are
come the Town will be reliev'd, and the Governor brought
over; in plain <hi>English,</hi> our Fortune is made; my Master
must marry the Lady, and the old Gentleman may go to
the Devil.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Heyday! what is all this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Say no more, the Dice are thrown, Doublets for
us; away to your young Mistress, while I run to my Master,
tell her <hi>Rhodophil! Rhodophil!</hi> will be with her immediately;
then if her Blood does not mount to her Face like
Quicksilver in a Weather-glass, and point to extreme hot,
believe the whole a Lye, and your Husband no Politician.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>This is news, indeed! I have had the Place but
a little while, and have not quite got into the Secrets of the
Family; but Part of your Story is true, and if you'll bring
your Master, and Miss is willing, I warrant we'll be too
hard for the old Folks.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>I'll about it straight;—but hold, <hi>Tag,</hi> I had

<p>Coming, Madam.—My old Lady calls; away,

<head><stage>SCENE changes to a Chamber.</stage></head>
<stage>Enter <hi>Aunt</hi> and <hi>Tag.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
<p>Who was that Man you were talking to, <hi>Tag</hi>?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>A Cousin of mine, Madam, that brought me some
News from my Aunt in the Country.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
<p>Where's my Neice? Why are not you with her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>She bid me leave her alone—She's so melancholy,
Madam, I don't know what's come to her of late—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
<p>The Thoughtfulness that is natural upon the Approach
of Matrimony, generally occasions a decent Concern.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>And do you think, Madam, a Husband of threescore
and five—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
<p>Hold, <hi>Tag,</hi> he protests to me he is but five and
Fifty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>He is a Rogue, Madam, and an old Rogue, and a
fumbling old Rogue, which is the worst of Rogues.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
<p>Alas! Youth or Age, 'tis all one to her; she is
all Simplicity without Experience: I would not force her
Inclinations, but she's so innocent she won't know the Difference—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Innocent! ne'er trust to that, Madam; I was innocent
myself once, but <hi>Live and Learn</hi> is an old Saying,
and a true one:—I believe, Madam, no Body is more
innocent than yourself, and a good Maid you are to be sure
but tho' you really don't <hi>know</hi> the Difference, yet you can
<hi>fancy it</hi> I warrant you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
<p>I should prefer a large Jointure to a small one,
and that's all; but 'tis impossible that <hi>Biddy</hi> should have
Desires, she's but newly come out of the Country, and just
turn'd of Sixteen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>That's a ticklish Age, Madam! I have observ'd
she does not eat, nor she does not sleep; she sighs, and she
cries, and she loves Moon-light; these, I take it, are very
strong Symptoms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
<p>They are very unaccountable, I must confess;
but you talk from a deprav'd Mind, <hi>Tag,</hi> her's is simple
and untainted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>She'll make him a Cuckold tho' for all that, if
you force her to marry him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
<p>You shock me, <hi>Tag,</hi> with your coarse Expressions;
I tell you, her Chastity will be her Guard, let her
Husband be what he will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Chastity! Never trust to that, Madam; get her a
Husband that's fit for her, and I'll be bound for her Virtue;
but with such a one as Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> I'm a Rogue if I'd answer
for my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
<p>Well, <hi>Tag,</hi> the Child shall never have reason to
repent of my Severity; I was going before to my Lawyers
to speak about the Articles of Marriage. I will now put a
Stop to 'em for some time, till we can make farther Discoveries.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Heav'n will bless you for your Goodness; look
where the poor Bird comes, quite mop'd and melancholy;
I'll set my Pump at work, and draw something from her
before your Return, I warrant you.</p>
<stage>[Exit <hi>Aunt</hi></stage>
<p><pb n="10" facs="13"/>
There goes a Miracle; she has neither Pride, Envy, or Ill-nature,
and yet is near Sixty, and a Virgin.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Biddy.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>How unfortunate a poor girl am I, I dare not
tell my Secrets to any Body, and if I don't I'm undone—Heigho! <stage>[Sighs.]</stage> Pray, <hi>Tag,</hi> is my Aunt gone to her
Lawyer about me? Heigho!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>What's that Sigh for my dear young Mistress?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bid.</speaker>
<p>I did not sigh, not I— <stage>[Sighs.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Nay, never gulp 'em down, they are the worst
Things you can swallow. There's something in that little
Heart of yours, that swells it and puffs it, and will burst it
at last, if you don't give it vent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bid.</speaker>
<p>What would you have me tell you?<stage>[Sighs.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, your are afraid I'll betray you, but
you had as good speak, I may do you some Service you
little think of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>It is not in your Power, <hi>Tag,</hi> to give me what I
want.</p>
<stage>[Sighs.]</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Not directly, perhaps; but I may be the means of
helping you to it; as for Example—If you should not
like to marry the old Man your Aunt designs for you, one
might find a way to break—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>His Neck, <hi>Tag</hi>?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Or the Match; either will do, Child.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I don't care which indeed, so I was clear of him—I
don't think I'm fit to be marry'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>To him you mean—You have no Objection to
Marriage, but the Man, and I applaud you for it: But
come, Courage, Miss, never keep it in; out with it all—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>If you'll ask me any Questions, I'll answer 'em,
but I can't tell you any thing of myself, I shall blush if I do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Well then—In the first Place, Pray tell me,
Miss <hi>Biddy Bellair,</hi> if you don't like somebody better than
old Sir <hi>Simon Loveit</hi>?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Heigho!</p>

<sp>
<pb n="11" facs="14"/>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>What's Heigho, Miss?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>When I say Heigho! it means yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Very well; and this Somebody is a young handsome
Fellow?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Heigho!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>And if you were once his, you'd be as merry as
the best of us?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Heigho!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>So far so good: and since I have got you to wet
your Feet, souce over Head at once, and the Pain will be
over.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>There—then. <stage>[A long Sigh.] </stage> Now help me
out, <hi>Tag,</hi> as fast as you can.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>When did you hear from your Gallant?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Never since he went to the Army.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>How so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I was afraid the Letters would fall into my Aunt's
Hands, so I would not let him write to me; but I had a
better Reason then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Pray let's hear that too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Why, I thought if I should write to him, and
promise him to love no body else, and should afterwards
change my Mind, he might think I was inconstant, and call
me a Coquette.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>What a simple Innocent it is! <stage>[Aside.] </stage> And have
you chang'd your Mind, Miss?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>No indeed, <hi>Tag,</hi> I love him the best of any of
'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Of any of 'em! Why, have you any more?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Pray don't ask me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Miss, if you only trust me by Halves, you
can't expect—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I will trust you with every thing.—When I
parted with him, I grew melancholy; so in order to divert
me, I have let two others court me till he returns again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="12" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Is that all, my Dear? Mighty simple, indeed.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>One of 'em is a fine blustering Man, and is call'd
Captain <hi>Flash;</hi> he's always talking of Fighting, and Wars;
he thinks he's sure of me, but I shall balk him; we shall
see him this Afternoon, for he press'd strongly to come, and
I have given him Leave, while my Aunt's taking her Afternoon's
Nap.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>And who is the other, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Quite another sort of a Man; he speaks like a
Lady for all the World, and never swears as Mr. <hi>Flash</hi> does,
but wears nice white Gloves, and tells me what Ribbons become
my Complexion, where to stick my Patches, who is
the best Millener, where they sell the best Tea, and which
is the best Wash for the Face, and the best Paste for the
Hands; he is always playing with my Fan, and shewing his
Teeth, and whenever I speak he pats me—so—and cries,
<hi>The Devil take me, Miss</hi> Biddy, <hi>but you'll be my Perdition</hi>—Ha,
ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Oh the pretty Creature! And what do you call
him pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>His Name's <hi>Fribble;</hi> you shall see him too, for
by Mistake I appointed 'em at the same time; but you
must help me out with 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>And suppose your Favourite should come too—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I should not care what became of the others.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>What's his Name?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>It begins with an <hi>R—h—o</hi>—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>I'll be hang'd if it is not <hi>Rhodophil.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I am frighten'd at you! You are a Witch, <hi>Tag!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>I am so, and I can tell your Fortune too. Look
me in the Face. The Gentleman you love most in the
World will be at our House this Afternoon; he arriv'd from
the Army this Morning, and dies till he sees you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Is he come, <hi>Tag</hi>? Don't joke with me—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Not to keep you longer in Suspence, you must
know the Servant of your <hi>Strephon,</hi> by some unaccountable
Fate or other, is my Lord and Master; he has just been
with me, and told me of his Master's Arrival and Impatience—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Oh my dear, dear <hi>Tag,</hi> you have put me out of
my Wits—I am all over in a Flutter—I shall leap out of
my Skin—I don't know what to do with myself—Is he
come, <hi>Tag</hi>?—I am ready to faint—I'd give the World
I had put on my Pink and Silver Robings to-day.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>I assure you, Miss, you look charmingly!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy,</speaker>
<p>Do I indeed tho'? I'll put a little Patch under
my left Eye, and powder my Hair immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>We'll go to Dinner first, and then I'll assist you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Dinner! I can't eat a Morsel—I don't know
what's the Matter with me—my Ears tingle, my Heart
beats, my Face flushes, and I tremble every Joint of me—I must run in and look myself in the Glass this Moment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Yes, she has it, and deeply too; this is no Hypocrisy—</p>
<l>Not Art, but Nature now performs her Part,</l>
<l>And every Word's the Language of the Heart.</l>

<head>ACT II. SCENE I.</head>
<head><stage>SCENE continues.</stage></head>
<stage>Enter Captain <hi>Loveit, Biddy, Tag,</hi> and <hi>Puff.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>TO find you still constant, and to arrive at
such a critical Juncture, is the height of Fortune
and Happiness</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Nothing shall force me from you; and if I am
secure of your Affections—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>I'll be bound for him, Madam, and give you
any Security you can ask.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Every thing goes on to our Wish, Sir; I just
now had a second Conference with my old Lady, and
she was so convinced by my Arguments, that she return'd
instantly to the Lawyer to forbid the drawing out of any
Writings at all, and she is determin'd never to
thwart Miss's Inclinations, and left it to us to give the
old Gentleman his Discharge at the next Visit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>Shall I undertake the old Dragon?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>If we have Occasion for Help, we shall call for
you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I expect him every Moment, therefore I'll tell
you what, <hi>Rhodophil,</hi> you and your Man shall be lock'd
up in my Bed-chamber till we have settled Matters with
the old Gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>Do what you please with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>You must not be impatient tho'</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>I can undergo any thing with such a Reward in
view, one Kiss and I'll be quite resign'd—and now
shew me the way.</p>
<stage>[Exeunt.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Come. Sirrah, when I have got you under Lock
and Key, I shall bring you to Reason.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="18"/>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Are your Wedding-clothes ready, my Dove? the
Certificate's come.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Go follow your Captain, Sirrah—march—You may Thank Heav'n I had Patience to stay so long.</p>
<stage>[Exeunt <hi>Tag</hi> and <hi>Puff.</hi></stage>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Biddy.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy,</speaker>
<p>I was very much alarm'd for fear my two Gallants
should come in upon us unawares; we should have
had sad work if they had: I find I love <hi>Rhodophil</hi> vastly,
for tho' my other Sparks flatter me more, I can't abide
the thoughts of 'em now—I have Business upon
my Hands enough to turn my little Head, but egad my
Heart's good, and a Fig for Dangers—let me see,
what shall I do with my two Gallants? I must, at least,
part with 'em decently; suppose I set 'em together by
the Ears?—The luckiest thought in the World! For if
if they won't quarrel (as I believe they won't) I can
break with them for Cowards, and very justly dismiss
'em my Service; and if they will fight, and one of 'em
should be kill'd, the other will certainly be hang'd, or
run away, and so I shall very handsomely get rid of both.—I
am glad I have settled it so purely.</p>
<stage>Enter <hi>Tag.</hi></stage>
<p>Well, <hi>Tag,</hi> are they safe?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>I think so, the Door's double lock'd, and I
have the Key in my Pocket.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>That's pure; but have you given 'em any thing
to divert 'em?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>I have given the Captain one of your old Gloves
to mumble, but my <hi>Strephon</hi> is diverting himself with
the more substantial Comforts of a cold Ven'son Pasty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>What shall we do with the next that comes?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>If Mr. <hi>Fribble</hi> comes first, I'll clap him up into
my Lady's Store-room; I suppose he is a great Maker
<pb n="16" facs="19"/>
of Marmalade himself, and will have an Opportunity
of making some critical Remarks upon our Pastry
and Sweet-meats.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>When one of 'em comes, do you go and watch
for the other, and as soon as you see him, run in to
us, and pretend it is my Aunt, and so we shall have an
Excuse to lock him up till we want him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>You may depend upon me; here is one of
'em.—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter <hi>Fribble.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Fribble,</hi> your Servant—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Fribble.</speaker>
<p>Miss <hi>Biddy</hi> your Slave—I hope I have not
come upon you abruptly; I should have waited upon
you sooner, but an Accident happen'd that discompos'd
me so, that I was obliged to go home again to take
Drops.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Indeed you don't look well, Sir.—Go,
<hi>Tag,</hi> and do as I bid you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>I will, Madam.</p>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I have set my Maid to watch my Aunt, that
we mayn't be surprized by her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>Your Prudence is equal to your Beauty, Miss,
and I hope your permitting me to kiss your Hands, will
be no Impeachment of your Understanding.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I hate the Sight of him. <stage>[Aside.] </stage> I was afraid
I should not have had the Pleasure of seeing you, pray
let me know what Accident you met with, and what's
the matter with your Hand? I shan't be easy till I
know.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>Well I vow, Miss <hi>Biddy,</hi> you're a good <hi>Creater,</hi>—I'll endeavour to muster up what little Spirits
I have, and tell you the whole Affair—Hem!—But first you must give me leave to make you a Present
of a small Pot of my Lip-salve; My Servant made it
this Morning—the Ingredients are innocent, I assure
<pb n="17" facs="20"/>
you; nothing but the best Virgin's-wax, Conserve of
Roses, and Lilly of the Valley Water.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I thank you, Sir, but my Lips are generally
red, and, when they an't, I bite 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>I bite my own, sometimes, to pout 'em a little,
but this will give them a Softness, Colour, and an agreeable
<hi>Moister.</hi>—Thus let me make an humble Offering
at that Shrine, where I have already sacrific'd my Heart.</p>
<stage>[Kneels and gives the Pot.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Upon my Word that is very prettily express'd,
you are positively the best Company in the World—I wish he was out of the House.</p>
<stage>[Aside.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>But to return to my Accident, and the Reason
why my Hand is in this Condition—I beg you'll excuse
the Appearance of it, and be satisfyed that nothing but
mere Necessity could have forc'd me to appear thus
muffled before you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I am very willing to excuse any Misfortune
that happens to you, Sir.</p>
<stage>(Curtsies.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>You are vastly good indeed,—thus it was.—Hem!—You must know, Miss, there is not
an Animal in the Creation I have so great an Aversion
to, as those Hackney-coach Fellows—As I was
coming out of my Lodgings,—Says one of 'em
to me, <hi>Would your Honour heve a Coach</hi>?—No, Man,
said I, not now (with all the Civility imaginable)—<hi>I'll carry you and your Doll too,</hi> (says he) <hi>Miss</hi> Margery
<hi>for the same Price.</hi>—Upon which the masculine
Beasts about us fell a laughing; then I turn'd round in
a great Passion, curse me, (says I) Fellow, but I'll
trounce thee.—And, as I was holding out my Hand in
a threatning <hi>Poster,</hi>—thus;—he makes a Cut at
me with his Whip, and striking me over the Nail of my
little Finger, it gave me such exquisite <hi>Torter</hi> that I
fainted away; and, while I was in this Condition, the
<pb n="18" facs="21"/>
Mob pick'd my Pocket of my Purse, my Scissars, my
<hi>Mocoa</hi> Smelling-Bottle, and my Huswife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I shall laugh in his Face. <stage>(Aside.) </stage> I am afraid
you are in great Pain; pray sit down, Mr. <hi>Fribble,</hi> but
I hope your Hand is in no Danger.</p>
<stage>[They sit.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>Not in the least, Maam; pray don't be apprehensive—A
Milk-poultice, and a gentle Sweat to
Night, with a little Manna in the Morning, I am confident
will relieve me entirely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>But pray, Mr. <hi>Fribble,</hi> do you make use of a
Huswife?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>I can't do without it, Maam; there is a Club
of us, all young Batchelors, the sweetest Society in the
World; and we meet three times a Week at each others
Lodgings, where we drink Tea, hear the Chat of
the Day, invent Fashions for the Ladies, make Models
of 'em, and cut out Patterns in Paper. We were the
first Inventors of Knotting, and this Fringe is the original
Produce and joint Labour of our little Community.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>And who are your pretty Set, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>There's <hi>Phil Whiffle, Jacky Wagtail,</hi> my Lord
<hi>Trip, Billy Dimple,</hi> Sir <hi>Dilbery Diddle,</hi> and your
humble—</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>What a sweet Collection of happy Creatures!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>Indeed and so we are, Miss,—But a prodigious
<hi>Fracas</hi> disconcerted us some time ago at <hi>Billy
Dimple</hi>'s—three drunken naughty Women of the
Town burst into our Club-room, curst us all, threw
down the China, broke six Looking-glasses, scalded us
with the Slop-Bason, and <hi>scrat</hi> poor <hi>Phil Whiffle</hi>'s
Cheek in such a manner, that he has kept his Bed these
three Weeks.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Mr. <hi>Fribble,</hi> I think all our Sex have
great Reason to be angry; for if you are so happy now
<pb n="19" facs="22"/>
you are Batchelors, the Ladies may wish and sigh to
very little purpose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>You are mistaken, I assure you; I am prodigiously
rallied about my Passion for you, I can tell you
that, and am look'd upon as lost to our Society already;
He, he, he!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Mr. <hi>Fribble,</hi> now you have gone so far,
don't think me impudent if I long to know how you
intend to use the Lady who shall be honour'd with
your Affections?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>Not as most other Wives are us'd, I assure you;
all the domestick Business will be taken off her Hands;
I shall make the Tea, comb the Dogs, and dress the
Children myself, so that tho' I'm a Commoner, Mrs.
<hi>Fribble</hi> will lead the Life of a Woman of Quality; for
she will have nothing to do, but lie in Bed, play at
Cards, and scold the Servants.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>What a happy Creature must she be!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>Do you really think so? Then pray let me
have a little <hi>serous</hi> Talk with you.—Tho' my Passion
is not of a long standing, I hope the Sincerity of
my Intentions—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>Go, you wild Thing. <stage>[Pats her.] </stage> The Devil
take me but there is no talking to you.—How can you
use me in this barbarous manner! If I had the Constitution
of an Alderman it would sink under my Sufferings—<hi>hooman Nater</hi> can't support it.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Why, what would you do with me, Mr.
<hi>Fribble</hi>?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>Well, I vow I'll beat you if you talk so—don't
look at me in that manner.—Flesh and Blood
can't bear it—I could—but I won't grow indecent—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>But pray, Sir, where are the Verses you were
to write upon me? I find if a young Lady depends too
<pb n="20" facs="23"/>
much upon such fine Gentlemen as you, she'll certainly
be disappointed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>I vow, the Flutter I was put into this Afternoon
has quite turn'd my Senses—here they are tho'—and
I believe you'll like 'em.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>There can be no doubt of it.</p>
<stage>[Curtsies.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>I protest, Miss, I dont like that Curtsey—Look
at me, aud always rise in this manner. <stage>[Shews
her] </stage> But, my dear <hi>Creater,</hi> who put on your Cap to-day?
They have made a Fright of you, and it's as yellow as
old Lady <hi>Crowfoot</hi>'s Neck.—When we are settled, I'll
dress your Heads myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Pray read the Verses to me, Mr. <hi>Fribble.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>I obey—Hem!—<hi>William Fribble,</hi> <abbr>Esq</abbr> to
Miss <hi>Biddy Bellair</hi>—greeting.</p>
<l>No Ice so hard, so cold as I,</l>
<l>'Till warm'd and softn'd by your Eye;</l>
<l>And now my Heart dissolves away</l>
<l>In Dreams by Night, in Sighs by Day;</l>
<l>No brutal Passion fires my Breast,</l>
<l>Which loaths the Object when possess'd;</l>
<l>But one of harmless, gentle Kind,</l>
<l>Whose Joys are center'd—in the Mind:</l>
<l>Then take with me Love's better Port,</l>
<l>His downy Wing, but not his Dart.</l>
<p>How do you like them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! I swear they are very pretty—but
I don't quite understand 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Frib.</speaker>
<p>These light Pieces are never so well understood
in Reading as Singing; I have set 'em myself,
and will endeavour to give 'em you—<hi>La la</hi>—I have
an abominable Cold, and can't sing a Note; however
the Tune's nothing, the Manner's all.</p>

<p>Indeed it is not, Sir.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>No, 'twas Mr. <hi>Flash,</hi> I suppose, by the

be here this Minute—What shall we do with him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>I'll manage him, I warrant you, and try his

<sp>

<p>Don't be asham'd, Mr. <hi>Flash;</hi> I have told

you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flash.</speaker>
<p>Is she? Then she wont be mine I am certain
<stage>[Aside.] </stage> Well Mrs. <hi>Tag,</hi> you know, I suppose, what's

<p>The Wedding-day, Sir?</p>

<p>The Wedding-day, Sir? Ay, Sir, the

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>My dear Captain <hi>Flash,</hi> don't make such a

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flash.</speaker>
<p>And suppose I did, Child, what then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>She'd be frighten'd out of her Wits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

I have some Reason to believe I am not quite so shocking.</p>
<stage>[Affectedly.</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir, you flatter yourself—But pray,
Sir, what are your Pretensions?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flash.</speaker>
<p>The Lady's Promises, my own Passion, and
the best mounted Blade in the three Kingdoms. If any
Man can produce a better Title, let him take her;
if not, the D—l mince me, if I give up an Atom
of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>He's in a fine Passion, if he would but hold it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, hear Reason a little.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flash.</speaker>
<p>I never do, Madam; it is not my Method of
Proceeding; here's my Logick; <stage>[Draws his Sword.]</stage> Sa, sa,—my best Argument is Cart over Arm,
Madam, ha, ha, <stage>[lunges.] </stage> and if he answers that, Madam,
<pb n="23" facs="26"/>
through my small Guts, my Breath. Blood and
Mistress are all at his Service—Nothing more,
Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>This 'll do, this 'll do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>But Sir, Sir, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flash.</speaker>
<p>But Madam, Madam, Madam: I profess
Blood, Madam, I was bred up to it from a
Child; I study the Book of Fate, and the Camp is my
my University; I have attended the Lectures of Prince
<hi>Charles</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and <hi>Bathiani</hi> upon the <hi>Po,</hi> and
have extracted Knowledge from the Mouth of a Cannon;
I'm not to be frighten'd with Squibs, Madam,
no, no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Pray, dear Sir, don't mind her, but let me
prevail with you to go away this Time—Your
Passion is very fine to be sure, and when my Aunt and
<hi>Tag</hi> are out of the way, I'll let you know when I'd
have you come again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flash.</speaker>
<p>When you'd have me come again, Child?
And suppose I never would come again, what do you
think of that now, ha? You pretend to be afraid of
your Aunt; your Aunt knows what's what too well
to refuse a good Match when 'tis offer'd—Lookee,
Miss, I'm a Man of Honour, Glory's my Aim, I have
told you the Road I am in, and do you see here,
Child, <stage>[Shewing his Sword.] </stage> no Tricks upon Travellers.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>But pray, Sir, hear me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flash.</speaker>
<p>No, no, no, I know the World, Madam, I
am as well known at <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> as the Dial, Madam:
I'll break a Lamp, bully a Constable, bam a
Justice, or bilk a Box-keeper with any in the Liberties
of <hi>Westminster;</hi> What do you think of me now,
Madam?</p>

<p>Come, come, come, few Words are best, somebody's
happier than somebody, and I'm a poor silly
Fellow; ha, ha,—That's all—Look you Child,
to be short, (for I'm a Man of Reflexion) I have but a
<hi>Bagatelle</hi> to say to you: I am in love with you up

not—But since there is another more fortunate than I,
Adieu, <hi>Biddy!</hi> Prosperity to the happy Rival, Patience

not think I should have the Pleasure of being knock'd o' th'
Head, or-cut up alive by so fine a Gentleman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>I am under such Confusion, Sir, I have not Power
to convince you of my Innocence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p>Innocence! pretty Lamb! And so, Sir, you
have left the Regiment, and the honourable Employment
of fighting for your Country, to come home and cut your
Father's Throat; why you'll be a great Man in time, <hi>Bob!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>His Father, <hi>Tag!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, 'tis soon done—one Stroke
<pb n="33" facs="33"/>
does it—or, if you have any Qualms, let your 'Squire
there perform the Operation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, don't throw such Temptations in my way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>Hold your impudent Tongue!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p>Why don't you speak, Mr. <hi>Modesty;</hi> what
Excuse have you for leaving the Army, I say?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>My Affection to this Lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p>Your Affection, Puppy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>Our Love, Sir, has been long and mutual; what
Accidents have happen'd since my going abroad, and her
leaving the Country, and how I have most unaccountably
met you here, I am a Stranger to; but whatever Appearances
may be, I still am, and ever was, your dutiful Son.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>He talks like an Angel, <hi>Tag!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p>Dutiful, Sirrah! Have you not rival'd your
Father?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, you have rival'd me; my Claim must
be prior to yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> he can shew the best Title to
me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>Sir, Sir, the young Gentleman speaks well, and
as the Fortune will not go out of the Family, I would advise
you to drop your Resentment, be reconcil'd to your
Son, and relinquish the Lady.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, with all my Heart—Look ye, Son,
I give you up the Girl, she's too much for me, I confess;—And
take my Word, <hi>Bob,</hi> you'll catch a <hi>Tartar.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I assure you, Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> I'm not the Person you
take me for; if I have us'd you any ways ill, 'twas for
your Son's sake, who had my Promise and Inclinations before
you; and tho' I believe I should have made you a most
uncomfortable Wife, I'll be the best Daughter to you in
the World; and if you stand in need of a Lady, my Aunt
is disengag'd, and is the best Nurse—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p>No, no, I thank you, Child; you have so
turn'd my Stomach to Marriage, I have no Appetite left.—<pb n="34" facs="34"/>
But where is this Aunt? Won't she stop your Proceedings,
think you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>She's now at her Lawyer's, Sir, and if you please
to go with the young Couple, and give your Approbation,
I'll answer for my old Lady's Consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>The Captain, and I, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, <hi>Bob,</hi> you are but an Ensign, don't
impose on the Girl neither.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>I had the good Fortune, Sir, to please my Royal
General by my Behaviour in a small Action with the Enemy,
and he gave me a Company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p><hi>Bob,</hi> I wish you Joy! This is News indeed!
And when we celebrate your Wedding, Son, I'll drink a
half Pint Bumper myself to your Benefactor.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>And he deserves it, Sir; such a General, by his
Example and Justice, animates us to Deeds of Glory, and
insures us Conquest.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p>Right, my Boy—come along then.</p>
<stage>[Going.</stage>

<p>Halt a little, Gentlemen and Ladies, if you please:
Every Body here seems well satisfy'd but myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>What's the Matter, <hi>Puff</hi>?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Sir, as I would make myself worthy of such a Master,
and the Name of Soldier, I cannot put up the least
Injury to my Honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p>Heyday! What Flourishes are these?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>Here is the Man; come forth, Caitiff. <stage>[To <hi>Jasper.</hi>]</stage> He hath confess'd this Day, that, in my Absence, he had
taken Freedoms with my lawful Wife, and had dishonourable
Intentions against my Bed; for which I demand Satisfaction.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p><stage>[Striking him.] </stage> What Stuff is here, the Fellow's
Brain's turn'd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>And crack'd too, Sir; but you are my Master's
Father, and I submit.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, I'll settle your Punctilios, and will
<pb n="35" facs="35"/>
take care of you and <hi>Tag</hi> hereafter, provided you drop all
Animosities, and shake Hands this Moment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Puff.</speaker>
<p>My Revenge gives way to my Interest, and I once
again, <hi>Jasper,</hi> take you to my Bosom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Jasper.</speaker>
<p>I'm your Friend again, <hi>Puff</hi>—but harkye—I fear you not; and if you'll lay aside your Steel there, as
far as a broken Head, or a black Eye, I'm at your Service
upon Demand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tag.</speaker>
<p>You are very good at Crowing indeed, Mr. <hi>Jasper;</hi>
but let me tell you, the Fool that is Rogue enough to brag
of a Woman's Favours, must be a Dunghill every way—As
for you, my dear Husband, shew your Manhood in a
proper Place, and you need not fear these Sheep-biters.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Sim.</speaker>
<p>The <hi>Abigail</hi> is pleasant I confess, he, he!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Biddy.</speaker>
<p>I'm afraid the Town will be ill-natur'd enough
to think I have been a little coquettish in my Behaviour;
but, I hope, as I have been constant to the Captain, I shall
be excus'd diverting myself with Pretenders.</p>
<l>Ladies, to Fops and Braggarts ne'er be kind,</l>
<l>No Charms can warm 'em, and no Virtues bind;</l>
<l>Each Lover's Merit by his Conduct prove,</l>

<head>Spoke by Mrs. <hi>PRITCHARD.</hi></head>
<lg>
<l>GOOD Folks, I'm came at my young Lady's bidding,</l>
<l>To say, You all are welcome to her Wedding.</l>
<l>Th'Exchange she made, what Mortal here can blame?</l>
<l>Shew me the Maid that would not do the same.</l>
<l>For sure the greatest Monster ever seen,</l>
<l>Is doting <hi>Sixty</hi> coupled to <hi>Sixteen!</hi></l>
<l>When wint'ry Age had almost caught the Fair,</l>
<l>Youth, clad in Sunshine, snatch'd her from Despair:</l>
<l>Like a new <hi>Semele</hi> the Virgin lay,</l>
<l>And clasp'd her Lover in the Blaze of Day.</l>
<l>Thus may each Maid, the Toils almost intrapt-in,</l>
<l>Change <hi>Old Sir Simon</hi> for the <hi>brisk young Captain.</hi></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>I love these Men of Arms, they know their Trade:</l>
<l>Let Dastards sue, these Sons of Fire invade!</l>
<l>They cannot bear around the Bait to nibble,</l>
<l>Like pretty, powder'd, patient Mr. <hi>Fribble</hi>:</l>
<l>To Dangers bred, and skilful in Command,</l>
<l>They storm the strongest Fortress, Sword in Hand!</l>
<l>Nights without Sleep, and Floods of Tears when waking,</l>
<l>Shew'd poor Miss <hi>Biddy</hi> was in piteous taking:</l>
<l>She's now quite well; for Maids in that Condition,</l>
<l>Find the young Lover is the best Physician;</l>
<l>And without Helps of Art, or Boast of Knowledge,</l>
<l>They cure more Women, faith, than all the College!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But to the Point—I come with low Petition,</l>
<l>For, faith, poor <hi>Bayes</hi> is in a sad Condition;</l>
<l><note n="*" place="foot">Alluding to <hi>Bayes</hi>'s Prologue in the <hi>Rehearsal.</hi></note> <hi>The huge tall Hangman</hi> stands to give the Blow,</l>
<l>And only waits your Pleasures—Ay, or No.</l>
<l>If you should—<hi>Pit, Box,</hi> and <hi>Gallery,</hi> egad!</l>
<l>Joy his Senses, and the Man runs mad:</l>
<l>But if your Ears are shut, your Hearts are Rock,</l>
<l>And you pronounce the Sentence—Block to Block,</l>
<l>Down kneels the Bard, and leaves you when he's dead,</l>
<l>The empty Tribute of an Author's Head.</l>
