<head><hi>To His GRACE WILLIAM Duke of</hi> Devonshire; Lord Steward of Her Majesty's Houshold, Lord in <hi>Eyre,</hi> North of <hi>Trent,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of the County of <hi>Derby;</hi> and One of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi></head>

<p>THE Muses were ever ambitious of being distinguish'd, by shrouding themselves under the Patronage of the greatest Men in all Ages; not made so by Titles or Preferment; but such, whose innate Principles of Honour, truly supported those their Prince had crown'd them with. From hence sprung my Presumption of laying the following Scenes at Your Grace's Feet; since the World must allow, that all those Virtues, which compleat a perfect good, as well as great Man, are
<pb facs="3"/>
center'd in the Duke of <hi>Devonshire</hi>; the loyalest Subject, the tenderest Husband, and the kindest Master, that ever Monarch, Wife, or Servant had; Briliant Graces, but such as do not shine in every Man of Quality. From such Patriots, what may not <hi>Britain</hi> hope? Nay, what might not She command, were all her Sons as fervent for her Interest, and discharg'd their respective Trusts with that Fidelity, and due Regard to the publick Good, as Your Grace has ever done in Yours: Then the hated Name of Faction wou'd be heard no more, and the scandalous Wounds of hot-headed Parties heal'd; which is the only way to secure this Island from foreign Insults, and establish Peace more firmly, than Armies, tho' vast as <hi>Xerxes</hi> led, can do.</p>
<p>To attempt your Grace's Character, is the superiour business of a Masculine Pen, and not to be reach'd by mine: But since my Husband has the Honour to serve Her Majesty, under the Command of Your Grace, as he did the late King of glorious Memory, under that of your noble Father, I cou'd not be prevail'd upon to alter my
<pb facs="4"/>
Resolution of prefixing your Grace's Name in the front of this Poem, at once to shew my Gratitude, and my Ambition: And if, when Your Grace's Mind's unbended from the Care and Business of the State, it finds the way in some leisure Hour to divert Your Grace, and the Author meet your Pardon for this Liberty, my Wishes are all answer'd; as I hope my Prayers will be, that Your Grace may enjoy a perfect Health, free from Pain in Mind, and Body; and see as many flourishing happy New Years, as your best and dearest Friends can desire; and every one add fresh Honours to those that are so deservedly worn by Your Grace at present, which are the earnest Wishes of</p>

<head>THE PREFACE.</head>
<p>I Shou'd not have troubled my Courteous Reader with a Preface, had I not lain under the Necessity of Clearing my self of what some People have been pleas'd to charge me with, <hi>viz.</hi> of being the Author of a Paper call'd, <hi>The Female Tattler,</hi> consequently of a Paragraph in that of the <hi>14</hi>th Instant, relating to this Comedy; tho' I think no reasonable Person will believe I could be guilty of so much Folly. Tho' Vanity is said to be the darling Vice of Womankind, yet nothing but an Idiot wou'd express themselves so openly; and I hope the World won't think me guilty of Printing, what I must blush to Read, nor imagine it Wrote even by any Friend of mine, for two Reasons; First, the Grossness of the Flattery. Secondly, the Injury it must of course do me, in the Run of my Play, by putting those People out of Humour, whose Action was to give Life to the Piece. I suppose these Reasons are sufficient to convince the Judicious part, that I was no ways concerned in those Reflections, but own I was treated with all the seeming Civility in the World, till the second Night of my Comedy. I willingly submitted to Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi>'s Superiour Judgment in shortning the Scene of the Ghost in the last Act, and believed him perfectly in the Right, because too
<pb facs="6"/>
much Repetition is tiresome. Indeed when Mr. <hi>Estcourt</hi> slic'd most of it out, I cou'd not help interposing my Desires to the contrary, which the rest readily comply'd with; and I had the Satisfaction to see I was not deceiv'd in my Opinion, of its pleasing. This Passage I happen'd to mention among my Acquaintance; for 'tis Natural to have a kind of a Tender for our own Productions, but especially if they have the good Fortune to divert others. Now, if from this the Author of the <hi>Tattler</hi> gather'd his Account, I am guilty of speaking, but not designedly; for who they are that Write that Paper, or how Distinguish'd, I am perfectly ignorant, and declare I never was concern'd, either in Writing, or Publishing, any of the <hi>Tattlers.</hi></p>
<p>I never had the Vanity to think, much less to publish, that any thing I am capable of doing, cou'd support the Stage, tho' I have had the good Fortune to please, or to find the Town willing to be pleas'd; tho' at present it seems a certain Author has enter'd a Caveat against all Plays running to a sixth Night, but his own. Tho' an Opera interfer'd with this Comedy, yet it brought above Forty Pounds the second Night, which shew'd it had some Merit; for I have known many a Play kept up, that fail'd of half that Money the second Night. Now by the Rules of the House, it ought to have been play'd on: But who can secure the Life of a Play, when that of a Man is often Sacrific'd to the Malice of Parties? This Play met with a kind Reception in general, and notwithstanding the Disadvantages it had to struggle with, by raising the Prices the first Day, and the Nearness of <hi>Christmas,</hi> it would have made its way to a sixth Night, if it had had fair Play. Mistake
<pb facs="7"/>
me not, I do not mean from the Representation; for I must do the Players Reason: Had I search'd all the Theatres in the World, I cou'd not have selected a better Company, nor had more Justice done me in the Action, tho' they have not dealt honourably by me in my Bargain; for they ought not to have stop'd the Run, upon any Pique whatever. 'Tis small Encouragment to Write for the Stage, when the Actors, according to the Caprice of their Humours, mangre the Taste of the Town, have power to sink the Reputation of a Play; for if they resolve not to Act it, the Town can't support it.</p>
<p>Well, if there is any Merit in suffering wrongfully, I shall find my Account in't one time or other; in the mean while I intreat the <hi>Female Tattler</hi> to be Witty no more at my Expence. I desire I may not be rank'd in the Number of those that support the Stage, since the Stage is become a Noun Substantive, and resolves to shew it is able to stand by itself.</p>

<head><hi>PROLOGUE.</hi> By a GENTLEMAN. Spoken by Mr. <hi>WILKS.</hi></head>
<l>OUR Female Author trembling stands within,</l>
<l>Her Fear arises from another's Sin;</l>
<l>One of her Sex has so abus'd the Town,</l>
<l>That on her Score she dreads your angry Frown:</l>
<l>Tho' I dare say, poor Soul, she never writ</l>
<l>Lampoon, or Satyr on the Box or Pit;</l>
<l>A harmless hum'rous Play is her Extent of Wit.</l>
<l>Tho' <hi>Bickerstaff</hi>'s vast Genius may engage,</l>
<l>And lash the Vice and Follies of the Age;</l>
<l>Why shou'd tender <hi>Delia</hi> tax the Nation?</l>
<l>Stickle, and make a Noise for Reformation,</l>
<l>Who always gave a Loose, her self, to Inclination.</l>
<l>Scandal and Satyr's thrown aside to Day,</l>
<l>And Humour the sole Business of our Play.</l>
<l>Beaux may dress on to catch the Ladies Hearts,</l>
<l>And good Assurance pass for mighty Parts:</l>
<l>The Citts may bring their Spouses without Fear,</l>
<l>We shew no Wife that's poaching for an Heir,</l>
<l>Nor teach the Use of fine Gause Handkercheir.</l>
<l>Cowards may huff, and talk of mighty Wonders,</l>
<l>And Jilts set up‚Äîfor Twenty thousand Pounders.</l>
<l>Our Author, even tho' she knows full well,</l>
<l>Is so Good-natur'd, she forbears to tell</l>
<l>What Collonels, lately, have found out the Knack</l>
<l>To Muster Madam, still, by <hi>Ned,</hi> or <hi>Jack,</hi></l>
<l>To keep their Pleasures up; a Frugal way,</l>
<l>They give her‚ÄîSubaltern's Subsistance for her Pay.</l>
<l>In short, what e'er your Darling Vices are,</l>
<l>They pass untouch'd in this Night's Bill of Fare.</l>
<l>But if all this can't your good Nature wake,</l>
<l>Tho' here and there, a Scene shou'd fail to take,</l>
<l>Yet spare her for the <hi>Busie-Body</hi>'s sake.</l>

<head><hi>EPILOGUE.</hi> Spoken by Mrs. <hi>OLDFIELD. Written by Mr.</hi> Cibber. A Porter delivers a Letter just as she is going to speak.</head>
<l>WHAT's this? a Billet-Deaux? from Hands unknown?</l>
<l>'Tis new to send it thus 'fore all the Town:</l>
<l>But since the poor Man's Passion's so agog,</l>
<l>I'll read it out by way of Epilogue.</l>
<stage>Reads,</stage>
<lg type="letter">
<l>Madam,</l>
<l>Permit a Wretch to let you know,</l>
<l>That he's no more in <hi>Statu Quo.</hi></l>
<l>My Ruine from this Night commences,</l>
<l>Unless your Smiles refund my Senses;</l>
<l>For with one Thrust of <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Dart,</l>
<l>You've whip'd your Slave quite thro' the Heart:</l>
<l>Therefore, I beg you, cast your Eye</l>
<l>O'er Boxes, Pit and Gallery,</l>
<l>In Pity of my Pains and Doubt,</l>
<l>And try if you can find me out.</l>
</lg>
<l>Poor Soul! He seems indeed in dismal Plight;</l>
<l>Let's see! it can't be, sure! from th' upper Flight;</l>
<l>No, no‚Äîthat's plain‚Äîfor ‚ÄîNone of them can Write:</l>
<l>Nor can I think it from the Middle fell;</l>
<l>For I'm afraid‚Äîas few of them can Spell:</l>
<l>Beside, their Haggling Passions never gain,</l>
<l>Beyond the Passage-walking Nymphs of <hi>Drury-Lane:</hi></l>
<l>And then the Pit's more stock'd with Rakes and Rovers,</l>
<l>Than any of these senseless, whining Lovers.</l>
<l>The Backs o' th' Boxes too seem mostly lin'd</l>
<l>With Souls, whose Passion's to themselves confin'd.</l>
<l>I<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="‚Ä¢" reason="illegible"/> s<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="‚Ä¢" reason="illegible"/>ort, I can't perceive, 'mongst all you Sparks,</l>
<l>The Wretch distinguish'd, by these bloody Marks.</l>
<l><pb facs="10"/>But since the Town has heard your kind Commands, Sir,</l>
<l>The Town shall e'en be Witness of my Answer.</l>
<l>First then, Beware you prove no Spark in Red,</l>
<l>With empty Purse, and Regimental Head;</l>
<l>That thinks no Woman can refuse t'engage in't,</l>
<l>While Love's advanc'd with offer'd Bills on Agent;</l>
<l>That swears he'll settle from his Joy's commencing,</l>
<l>And make the Babe, the Day he's Born, an Ensign.</l>
<l>Nor cou'd I bear a Titl'd Beau, that steals</l>
<l>From fasting Spouse her Matrimonial Meals;</l>
<l>That Modish sends next Morn to her Apartment,</l>
<l>A Civil How-deye‚Äîfar alas! from th' Heart meant:</l>
<l>Then Powder'd for th' ensuing Day's Delights,</l>
<l>Bows thro' his Croud of Duns, and drives to <hi>White</hi>'s.</l>
<l>Nor cou'd I like the Wretch, that all Night plays,</l>
<l>And only takes his Rest on Winning Days;</l>
<l>That sets up from a lucky Hit, his Rattler</l>
<l>Then's trac'd from his Orig'nal‚Äîin the <hi>Tattler.</hi></l>
<l>To tell you all that are my fixt Aversion,</l>
<l>Wou'd tire the Tongue of Malice, or Aspersion.</l>
<l>But if I find 'mongst All One generous Heart,</l>
<l>That Deaf to Stories takes this Stage's Part;</l>
<l>That thinks that Purse deserves to keep the Plays,</l>
<l>Whose Fortune's bound for the Support of Opera's;</l>
<l>That thinks our Constitution here is justly fixt,</l>
<l>And now no more with Lawyers Brawls perplext.</l>
<l>He, I declare, shall my whole Heart receive;</l>
<l>And (what's more strange) I'll love him while I live.</l>

<p>Ah! Pox of this riding Post,‚ÄîLook ye, Captain; if you have threescore Miles farther to go, I am your most humble Servant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>No, Sirrah, I am at my Journey's end‚ÄîThis Town of <hi>Peterborough</hi> is the bound of all my Wishes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Say you so, Sir! Pray be pleas'd to make it mine too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>Why! what is your wish?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Why, with submission, Sir, to know the reason of your Expedition, and gravity of Habit: Have you a mind to set up the Business of an Undertaker here in the Country?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>No, <hi>Clinch,</hi> my business is with the Living, not with the Dead, I'll assure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Then can't I for my blood imagine why you are thus dress'd; your Father, nay your whole Family are well; not so much as a Nephew, or second Cousin dead; nay, nor no fear of Peace.‚Äî‚ÄîThen why the Devil are we in black? You laugh‚ÄîCan these Cloaths cause Joy, without the Perquisite that belongs to it: 'Tis a mournful Equipage, and shocks my Soul, I am sure.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Perquisite! Why what Perquisite does Mourning bring with it to cause Joy? ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Sir, several‚ÄîAs when a Wife buries her Husband, she has Sorrow in one hand, and Joy in t'other; a short Widowhood cures such a Grief‚ÄîOr a rich Heir at the last Gasp of his Parent, when there is a Years Rent in the Steward's

hands ‚ÄîBut, Sir, to the point; either let me into the Secret, or discharge me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha; Why then if I must tell thee; this Habit, if Fortune favours me, will be worth to me two thousand Pounds.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Say you so, Sir; and pray how much will it be worth to me? For I am dress'd like you‚ÄîIf I have not the same Privileges, why should I be confin'd to the same Garb?</p>

<p>Oh! you shall have your part, <hi>Clinch,</hi> never fear.</p>

<p>Rascal!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Nay, ben't angry Sir; if there shou'd be Peace, 'tis what many an honest Gentleman must come to. I have no aversion for the Name; but I have for the Punishment‚Äî I'll not strike a stroke‚Äîtherefore what good can I do you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, I shall have more occasion for your Eyes, than your Arm‚ÄîYou can weep, Sirrah, can't you?</p>

<p>Ay, Sir, I shall weep, that's certain, to see you come to the Gallows‚Äî</p>

<p>Ye Dog you, I tell you there is no danger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>No danger‚ÄîWhy then I shall weep for Joy, Sir‚Äî ‚Äîbut how, Sir, how; must I roar, or shed Tears?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>So you do but counterfeit well, no matter which.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Ah, let me alone for counterfeiting, I defie a Woman to out-do me in that‚ÄîLook ye Sir, you shall hear ‚Äî ‚Äîhem, hem. <stage>Roars out.</stage></p>

<p>Very well‚Äîbe sure when I weep‚Äî</p>

<p>Oh! Excellent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>But what does this signifie! Where lies the Mystery?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Well then‚ÄîSince you must know it; You are not insensible how my Father has treated me, ever since I refus'd to marry Mrs. <hi>Homebred,</hi> whose Manners suited with her Name, and her Face was courser than either; and because I drew a Bill upon him for fifty Pounds last Campaign, he threatens to disinherit me; nay, and swears, that if for the future I don't make it appear I live upon half my Pay, He'll

make my Serjeant his Heir, who was once his Footman. In short, I can bear his ill usage no longer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Ah! Sir, had you married that Lady with twenty thousand Pounds, you need not have drawn upon him for fifty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>If she had twenty times as much, I shou'd refuse her for <hi>Belinda</hi>'s sake.</p>

<p>But Sir <hi>Jeffrey</hi> resolves against that Match‚ÄîYou must not marry his Steward's Daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>I hope to prove you a Lyar, Sir; and by this Dress to carry my design; which is to persuade <hi>Trusty,</hi> that my Father dyed of an Apoplexy, by which means he must account with me for the half Years Rent, he sent the old Gentleman word was ready for him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Two thousand Pound, <hi>Clinch</hi>‚ÄîThis Letter I surpriz'd by an Accident; 'tis from my Father to him. <stage>Reads.</stage></p>
<p>Mr. <hi>Trusty,</hi><lb/>
The several Sums which you have return'd me without any Receipt, amounts to eight hundred Pounds, there remains behind two thousand two hundred Pounds, which you tell me is ready for me; don't give your self any trouble about remitting that, for I design to be down my self in a Fortnight; and then the Leases which you mention'd, shall be renew'd.

<p>Excellent, Sir! Why here may be a pretty Penny towards, if the Devil don't cross it. But, Sir, if my old Master shou'd take a Maggot, and write to <hi>Trusty,</hi> to return his Money after all‚ÄîHis Letter and our Story wou'd have small connexion; we shou'd be oblig'd to alter our Note. I wou'd advise you to take the old Steward to the Tavern, and stay as little in his House as you can, for fear of discovery: Besides, Sir, a Glass of Wine and a Fowl, makes business go on chearfully, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Chearfully, Sirrah!‚ÄîYou don't consider that it is not my business to be chearful‚ÄîI admire <hi>Faithful</hi> stays so long.</p>

<p>Perhaps he can't find Mr. <hi>Lovely,</hi> Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>I directed him to the <hi>Coffee-house,</hi> where he seldom fails to be at this time of the Morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Poor Gentleman! I warrant he's ruminating upon his Misfortunes. Well! 'tis sometimes a Blessing to want Money‚Äî ‚ÄîYou 'scap'd the Highway-men, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>What am I the better for that, Sirrah? My Pockets are as empty as my Friends, who fell into their Hands: But here comes my Fellow Traveller‚Äîand <hi>Lovely</hi> with him; He has found him at last‚Äî Dear <hi>Lovely,</hi> how is't?</p>

<p>Captain <hi>Constant!</hi> Welcome! Who expected to see you here? Why did <gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="‚Ä¢‚Ä¢" reason="illegible"/>t you send me word of your coming?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>He hardly knew it himself two hours before he got on Horseback, Sir; nay, I much question if he knows it yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>My Journey indeed was something Precipitate.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir, don't you see we are in Mourning?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Faithful</hi> has inform'd me of every Particular; and I wish I cou'd really give thee Joy of six thousand a Year, Boy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>At the rate of half a Years Rent you may‚ÄîIf Fortune proves not an errand Jilt indeed, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>Come Gentlemen; What think you of my House? I'll get something for Breakfast, whilst you change your Linen.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>'Tis near Six‚ÄîI have a mind to see if <hi>Belinda</hi> comes to Church this Morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>She seldom fails‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faith.</speaker>
<p>Prithee, <hi>Lovely</hi>; Can you inform me, if a young Lady that lives at Sir <hi>David Watchum</hi>'s will be here too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. <hi>Laura Wealthy,</hi> Your Mistress you mean.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faith.</speaker>
<p>The same.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>We have heard of the Lady; but I believe no body in <hi>Peterborough</hi> has seen her, except his own Servants.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>What kind of a temper is the old Fellow of?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>The most peevish, splenetick, mistrustful, ill-natur'd Wretch in the whole County: He comes to the Coffee-house every Morning in an old rusty Chariot for haste, the longest Journey
<pb n="5" facs="16"/>
he takes in the Year: He seldom comes to Church; nay, since that Lady came he has not once been seen there; we fancy he dares not stay two hours from home, for fear she should be stol'n away.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Ah! Sir, this account is most uncomfortable in our Affairs‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faith.</speaker>
<p>It gives me more Chagrin, than the Rogues did, when they stripp'd me of my Money this Morning‚Äî Which way shall I give <hi>Laura</hi> notice of my being in Town?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Have Courage, <hi>Faithful,</hi> I warrant we prosper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>Nothing like a good Heart; you shall not want a small Sum of Money, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faith.</speaker>
<p>I thank you, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>I'll be as diligent in thy Affairs, as in my own‚Äî if any lucky Opportunity offers, I'll be ready to serve thee.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>I'll be the same to both.</p>

<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>I know it; and when I am able; as I hope if my design succeeds, thou shal't meet returns in me.</p>
</sp>

<p>I am oblig'd to both‚ÄîBut who have we here?</p>
</sp>
<stage>Several People cross the Stage to Church.</stage>

<p>Here comes <hi>Belinda,</hi> and with her my Tyrant <hi>Maria.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Faith.</speaker>
<p>Well, Gentlemen; you'll best entertain your Mistresses alone; I'll back to the Coffee-house, and over a Dish of Tea think what Course to steer‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Mind if the <hi>Courant</hi> be there, wherein I got my Father's Death inserted, the better to favour my Plot.</p>

<sp>

<p>I will, Captain, and be sure to confirm the News.‚Äî</p>

<p>But is <hi>Maria</hi> obdurate still <hi>Lovely?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>Not in reality, <hi>Constant</hi>‚ÄîBut she has so much of the Woman in her, to keep up her Rule till the last.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Belinda <hi>and</hi> Maria.</stage>
<sp>

<p>Ladies, good morrow! The sound of the Saint's Bell brings Angels abroad. <stage>Salutes 'em.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="17"/>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p><hi>Constant!</hi> and in Mourning! Pray who's dead?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>One for whom I ought to grieve, did it not smooth a Passage to <hi>Belinda</hi>'s Arms, through the Hearts of our inexorable Parents.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Your Father! Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>The same, Madam! He's as dead as an Herring, I promise you‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Now don't I know, whether I had best say I'm sorry for your Loss, or wish you much Joy of your Gain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>I dare swear, Madam, he can't tell you yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Peace, Blockhead.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>Mr. <hi>Lovely,</hi> are you for Prayers?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>You are the Shrine he kneels to, Madam; if you'll vouchsafe to hear him, he can pray most devoutly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>And dissemble most fervently‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>No faith, Madam, that Quality does not belong to us‚Äîthat is the Womens Prerogative.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>And do you never encroach upon our Privileges, sweet Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes faith; I have encroach'd upon some of the Sexes Privileges in my time, I must own. Curiosity‚Äî Madam, seldom leads us to put on Masking Habits; but a Lady cannot dress without 'em; Dissimulation is as necessary as her Patches.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Ay! How do you prove that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>Why thus: When you wou'd gain a Man you like, you appear what you are not‚ÄîWe believe you Angels, but don't always find you so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>We always find you Angels, but of the fal'n kind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>'Tis impossible to be otherwise, whilst Beauty keeps her Court below, you charm our Eyes, and all our Senses wait you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>Pride and Vanity predominate in your Sex, and like Centinels relieve one another; Pride has made a Lady swear she has Hated such a Man, tho' she was dying for the Sight of him‚ÄîAnd Vanity made her Caress a Fop, that at the same time she wish'd at the Devil.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>And are not you even with us? Will not you sigh, ogle, cringe, flatter, swear, kneel, nay give it under your hand, you Love to desperation; but let the poor mistaken
<pb n="7" facs="18"/>
Nymph once yield, and you'd give Bond and Judgment to that Old Gentleman you nam'd but now, in two Days to take her off your hands.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>I hope you don't include the whole Sex, Madam.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>That she do's not, I'm sure; for she knows I never swore any thing to her, but what I am ready to make good‚Äî And if she be not the most unconscionable Woman living, she will own I love her heartily.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>That I dare witness for thee, <hi>Lovely.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Ay! Why, what Proofs has he given?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>Proofs! Why I talk of her all Day‚ÄîAnd dream, of her all Night‚Äî‚ÄîWhen she's absent, sigh for her, and am transported when I see her. If these be not proofs of Love, let the Parson say Grace and I'll give her better.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>All this may be done without one Grain of Love, may it not Captain?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Not when you are the Object, Madam; and you are too well acquainted with my Heart, to ask that Question out of scruple, I'm certain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>These are no Proofs; you must grow Lean and Meagre‚ÄîEat little, and Sleep less‚ÄîWrite fifty Letters in a Day, and burn them all again‚ÄîThen start up, and draw your Sword; hold it to your Breast; then throw it away agen ‚Äî Then take your Pen and write your last Farewel‚ÄîDispatch it to your Mistress‚ÄîThen take a Turn by some melancholy purling Stream, with Hat pull'd o'er your Eyes, in deep Contemplation resolve thro' what Door to let in Death, if the Messenger return without Success‚ÄîWhen I see you do this, I'll write Lover upon your Brow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>When I do, you shall write Fool upon my Forehead.</p>
<l>Hang this whining way of Wooing,</l>
<l>Loving was design'd a Sport, <hi>&amp;c.</hi><stage>Sings.</stage></l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Come, come Madam, a Truce; you know he loves you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>As well as I know she loves me; we were born for one another, Child; no Man in the Kingdom shall have thee, but my self.‚ÄîThen if you will eat Chalk, and die of the Pip, I can't help it. Ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="19"/>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>But the Topick was not a Woman in that Assertion; but if it were, Women in their Days were no more like Women in ours, than a Clodhopper is to a Captain o' Foot. Our Ladies are like two Negatives, to be understood in the Affimative, ha, ha. Madam, do's not my Friend here look like one of those Lovers you describ'd? Faith, I think a Woman cannot wish a simpler Figure‚ÄîNow has he a thousand Things to say to <hi>Belinda</hi> alone.</p>

<p>You guess right, <hi>Lovely</hi>‚ÄîI am going to your Father's, Madam, to settle our Accounts; I hope you'll return as soon as Prayers are over.</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Sir David <hi>into a Garden before the Door.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Dav.</speaker>
<p>I Have survey'd my House round and round to Night, from Door to Door, and Gate to Gate‚Äî ‚ÄîHe that wou'd keep a handsome Woman of Twenty thousand Pound, must learn the Gamester's Art, to live without Sleep‚ÄîMethought, from my Garret Window, I saw a Man sauntring about my Ground, and seem'd to pry too narrowly into my House‚ÄîIt may be a Rogue‚ÄîI would not lose Mrs. <hi>Laura</hi>; for, if possible, she shall fill no Arms but mine. I have kept her from the sight of Man these twelve Months; and now I design to offer her Liberty, provided she'll consent to be my Wife; if she refuses, I'll have the Lights quite stop'd up, and she shall not so much as see the Sun‚ÄîHa! who's here! Ho, 'tis <hi>Lucy,</hi> her Maid; I wish I cou'd make this Jade of my Interest‚ÄîWhat the Vengeance do's she do up so early?</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Lucy.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lu.</speaker>
<p>This old Fellow is certainly the Devil‚ÄîOne can go no where, but one is sure to meet him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Dav.</speaker>
<p>What makes you here, ha Mistress?‚ÄîNow am I afraid of venturing to the Coffee-House, tho' my Coach is at the Door.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lu.</speaker>
<p>Too much Sleep is unwholsome, you know Sir, by your own Rule; so hearing the Door open, I came down to breath the Morning Air.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Dav.</speaker>
<p>That you might have done at your Window; no, no, you have some Plot in hand now I warrant! Where's your Mistress?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lu.</speaker>
<p>In her Chamber. Where shou'd she be?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Dav.</speaker>
<p>In her Bed wou'd be a fitter Place‚ÄîWomen of Virtue, that have no Intrigues, are fast asleep in their Beds at this time a-day</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="24"/>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>A sleep! That's impossible in this House‚ÄîPray how can any body s<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="‚Ä¢" reason="illegible"/>eep, as long as you are awake; are you not rambling all Night; up Stairs, down Stairs, locking one Door, and opening another; heming, coughing, spitting, sneezing, yawning, stamping, mutt'ring‚ÄîOne no sooner shuts ones Eyes‚Äîbut slap goes a Door, clatter goes a Key‚Äî down tumbles a Stool, bow wow goes the Dog‚ÄîThis is the constant Musick you make, Sir: 'Slife, if one were a Slave in <hi>Turkey,</hi> one shou'd sometimes rest in quiet.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Good lack, good lack, all this I get for my care‚Äî ‚ÄîWhy all this is for your Lady's good, <hi>Lucy.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if you call this Good! Then pray Sir employ your Study for the future, to do her ill Offices; for nothing can be more disagreeable, than your present treatment both to my Lady and me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Say you so! What, you don't like your way of living then? ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Not at all I assure you, Sir‚ÄîLiving! d'ye call it‚ÄîWe wou'd have Liberty, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>You shall have Liberty, if your Lady is not her own Enemy‚Äî‚Äîand for your part, if you please, you may serve your self, and her, by being serviceable to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Which way, pray Sir? For there is not many things I wou'd refuse to procure my Lady, her dear, dear Liberty; pray inform me, I'm impatient to know it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why thus‚ÄîI have a very Cordial Affection for Mrs. <hi>Laura,</hi> out of pure Consideration of her youth‚ÄîI wou'd not have a young Woman fall into ill hands at first; therefore I design to marry her my self.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Heaven forbid! that wou'd be falling into ill hands indeed. <stage>Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Now I wou'd have you break this matter to her; and second it with all the force of Argument you are capable of‚ÄîWhen we are married, you shall both take what Liberty you please.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Why sure a Person of your experienc'd Years, wou'd not be guilty of such a Folly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>What do you call Folly? I had no Ch<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="‚Ä¢" reason="illegible"/>ldren by my last Wife, and I wou'd willingly have an Heir to keep up my Name‚Äîand do you call this Folly?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="14" facs="25"/>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Heirs! Why do you hope for an Heir of your own getting, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Why not, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>What, upon such a fine Woman as she is‚ÄîIn my Conscience, were I in your place, I shou'd dread being the errantest, you know what, in Christendom.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Oh Mrs. Pert! that's not your business, I shall dread no such thing‚ÄîAll I desire of you, is to tell her, my Estate, Prudence, Wisdom and Temperance, out-weighs Youth, Folly, Titles, and Debauchery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
<p>Yes, for one that is in Love with her Grave. Certainly, Sir, you are not in your right Senses‚ÄîWhy your Request is so abominable, so vile, so ridiculous, and so unjust; that I wou'd not be concern'd in it for a thousand Pounds‚Äî Indeed you have pitch'd upon the wrong Person, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir. <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Say you so! Good lack‚ÄîSo I have pitch'd upon the wrong Person you say! ha! If I had desir'd you to say your Prayers, I'll be hang'd, if I had not pitch'd upon the wrong Person too, Gossip prate apace‚Äîbut I'll hamper ye, I warrant you; I'll cross your Designs, till I have finish'd my own ‚Äîgo, get out of my sight.</p>
</sp>

<p>Well, surely this Life won't last always. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>My Master stays at the Coffee-house, and has sent me to survey this Dome, and try to give Mrs. <hi>Laura</hi>'s Maid notice of his Arrival; but how far I may be serviceable to him, I know not‚ÄîHa! who have we yonder? The old Guardian himself I doubt‚ÄîSo, he has found me‚ÄîWhat the duce must I pretend now?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>

<p>Well, Good morrow; what more?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>I hope you are well, Sir.</p>

<p>Yes, thank Heaven, Sir! what then?</p>

<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Why then I am very glad of it, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>You are very glad of it, Sir! Why what a Pox is my Health to you? Who are you? What are you? And from whence come you, ha Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15" facs="26"/>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Faith, Sir, your Questions are so copious, that they require a considerable Study to answer: let me recollect a little‚ÄîI have gone through so many Trades, that without my Diary (which I have not about me at present) I can't remember half of them; nor indeed can I tell how to stile my self otherwise than an universal Man ‚ÄîThe World is my Country; and for want of an Estate, I live by my Wits‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>A Rogue, I warrant him. <stage>Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Sometimes an honest Man, sometimes a Knave; just as occasions fall out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ay! and you oftner happen to be a Knave, than an honest Man, I doubt, Friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Why look ye, Sir, that is just as I abound, or want Money; for my present Profession is Physick‚ÄîNow when my Pockets are full, I cure a Patient in three Days‚Äî ‚Äîwhen they are empty, I keep him three Months.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>An excellent Principle truly‚ÄîBut pray what is your business at my House?‚ÄîWe are all in a good state of health at present.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Nay no very great business, only I look'd in, as I pass'd by, Sir, that's all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Now in my Opinion you have another Reason; for you have the Aspect of one of those Sparks that comes in at a Window, or down a Chimney at two in the Morning‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Have a care what you say, Sir, I'm known very well not far off.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ay, too well perhaps! Zounds, Sir, what business have you here, speak.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>A queer old Duke this‚ÄîWhy, Sir, if you must know, I am in search of some Simples which I have occasion for‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Simples!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Simples! A very simple Excuse, saith‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Sir, I have many Years practis'd Chymistry, and there's scarce any Disease incident to Humanity, but I have cur'd; Stone, Gravel, Spleen, Vapours, fits of the Mother, and so forth‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16" facs="27"/>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Rather Fits of the Father, I fancy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>I had attain'd to such perfections in the Chymical Art, that I wanted but one degree of heat to reach the Philosopher's Stone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>That Habit methinks does not answer this mighty Skill.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Sir, Skill does not lie in Cloaths‚ÄîAnd the most ingenuous, are not always the most fortunate‚Äî I have had many Crosses in my time‚ÄîWhich has reduc'd me much below my Birth, I assure you‚ÄîI serve an Officer at present, in the Quality of a <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> whose Life I sav'd at the Battle of <hi>Audenard,</hi> when he was shot through with a Cannon Ball.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>How! shot through with a Cannon Ball?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir; what, do you wonder at that? Why, Sir, I have a Water, that if your Head were off, I'd but wash it with that, and clap it upon your Shoulders again; and you shou'd grow as perfectly well in half an hour, as ever you was in your Life; I have made the Experiment upon Thousands; my Master's Brother was one of them‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>If you were in Petticoats, I shou'd take you for the Kentish Miracle‚ÄîWhat is this Officer's Name, Friend, that you serve?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>Captain <hi>Bounce,</hi> Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p><hi>Bounce!</hi> I fancy you are related to him, are you not, Friend?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, not at all; indeed he uses me more like a Relation, than a Servant, for the reason before mentioned.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>Ha! And where is he, pray?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>At the <hi>Talbot,</hi> Sir; if you please I'll fetch him hither?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Dav.</hi></speaker>
<p>By no means, Sir; but what business have you here in <hi>Peterborough?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Man.</speaker>
<p>We have been raising Recruits, Sir‚ÄîA Pox of this old Dog; how many impertinent Questions does he ask‚Äî Here's no hopes of seeing <hi>Lucy</hi>‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Well, Sir, I desire you'd look your Simples elsewhere; for I don't like you, notwithstanding your fair Pretences.</p>

<p>The Back-way‚Äî‚ÄîWhat can be the meaning of this? Why shou'd he start at sight of me? There must be something more in it than I can fathom; and yet I think he's an honest Man.

<speaker>Rog.</speaker>
<p>Ay, Sir: But upon second Thoughts,‚Äî‚ÄîI must be a little wary too. Are not you some Rogue, that comes to rob the House

with half a dozen Pistols about you? For look yee, I'm an honest Man, and won't be drawn in for a Halter.</p>

<speaker>Sir <hi>Jeff.</hi></speaker>
<p>Sure some Madness has seiz'd the Family; for certainly I'm not chang'd‚ÄîWithout Dispute, <hi>Trusty</hi> knows me; but I'll find the Cause presently. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>So, Sir, here's Musick to your Wedding, with a Witness. What do you intend to do now?‚ÄîDo you think it possible to persuade your Father too, that he died of an Apoplexy?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>I fear, <hi>Clinch,</hi> that's beyond the Art of thy Impudence to do‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Nay, this Plot was none of my Impudence's contriving, that's my Comfort‚ÄîI'm but a Servant; my Master told me, he was in Mourning for his Father‚ÄîAnd faith I resolve not to believe the Father to the contrary. Such an entire Deference have I for all your Commands, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Why thou can'st not sure have the Confidence to stand it out to his Face.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Never fear me, Sir‚ÄîYou don't know what I can do ‚ÄîWhat say you, Sir? Shall we persuade the old Gentleman into a Ghost; or will you own your Fault, and refund the Money?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Neither, <hi>Clinch</hi>‚ÄîI have more Duty, than to attempt the <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="„Äà‚óä„Äâ" reason="illegible"/>; and more Necessity, than to submit to the other‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="57" facs="68"/>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Nay, if you be so divided‚ÄîWhat do you propose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>I know not what to do‚ÄîI'm glad the Ceremony was over, before he came.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>And the Money sent away‚ÄîWhat think you of my House, till the Heat of the Discovery be over? 'Tis my Opinion your Presence won't be proper‚ÄîI warrant Sir <hi>David</hi> will be in pursuit of Mrs. <hi>Laura</hi> presently too‚ÄîBut we have seen her fairly Marry'd; so that <hi>Faithful</hi> is out of Danger; we'll leave him here ‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>Shall I not take <hi>Belinda</hi> with us? I fear as much for her, as for my self‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<l>So there's no Body fears for me, I find‚Äî <stage>Aside.</stage></l>
<l>I am like to have my Part truly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>No, trust to her Management‚ÄîShe turn'd the Act upon her Father, you know, and made him impose her own Choice upon her. Let <hi>Clinch</hi> stay and use his own Discretion‚ÄîIf he can banter Sir <hi>Jeffry,</hi> and save his Bones, let him: But be sure to give us notice of all that passes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>What if my Bones are broke?‚ÄîI thank you heartily for your Love, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p>No, no, <hi>Clinch</hi>; take heed you keep out of the reach of his Cane.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clin.</speaker>
<p>Or he'll make me feel; he's Flesh and Blood‚ÄîHeark, I hear him coming, Good bye to you, Sir‚Äî <stage>Runs in.</stage></p>

<p>Well, I'm glad my Lady's Marry'd; for if this old Spark had come three Hours sooner, I wou'd not have ventur'd Two to Ten of the Match‚ÄîI can't imagine where the Bridegroom's gone‚ÄîNor what he will do, when my Master comes to have a right Understanding; but I resolve to keep him ignorant as long as I can.

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Trusty.</stage>
<p>Oh, Sir, I am frighted out of my Wits; I went to serve my Lady's <hi>Italian</hi> Greyhound, and I found a great swinging Dog, as large as an Ox, with two great Eyes, as big as Bushels; and before I cou'd call out,‚ÄîWhip it was vanish'd‚Äî</p>

<speaker>Dolly.</speaker>
<p>Ah! then it was certainly him I saw. Oh dear, oh dear, if the House be haunted, I must leave it. I cannot live in't, if I might have a Thousand Pounds; and may be, he'll appear to no Body but me‚ÄîI am sure I never did him any harm; 'tis true, I did not love him, because he was something Stingey‚Äî‚Äî He never gave me a Farthing in his Life‚Äî</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trusty.</speaker>
<p>Nay, for that matter, I have got many a fair Pound by him, and yet he appear'd to me to Day.</p>

<p>No, in his own Shape; but I wish I may never see him more, for I was horribly fear'd.</p>

<p>No! Sir, I'll not budge a Foot; for I dan't know what to say to you.

<p>No, Mr. <hi>Trusty</hi>; though you have us'd me dirtily, in making me the Jest of your Family; for you might have discover'd the Imposture with less precaution; yet I'll not take that advantage which the Laws allow.

<p>Go; You are not the Man I took you for‚Äîyou are but a Knave. You ought to have been as just to my Heir, as to my self‚ÄîWhat, was your Blood fit to be popt into my Estate? Ha! or have you been really a Steward, and cheated me out of a Fortune for your Daughter?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trusty.</speaker>
<p>Sir, what I am Master off, I got fairly under you, part, and part under my Lord <hi>Belville</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whom I serv'd twenty Years in the same Post I do you; when he died, he trusted me with a Secret, which yet I have divulged to no Man; and when I do, the World will say I am an honest Man. Love first join'd their Hearts, and my Ignorance their Hands; use me as you please, but pardon them.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Lovely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lov.</speaker>
<p>I must become an Intercessor in that too, Sir <hi>Jeffrey</hi>; Love is the great Cementer of the Marriage State; it reconciles all Differences‚Äîit bends the Stubborn‚Äîand it tames the Bold, it wins the Haughty, softens the Savage, and reclaims the Libertine; then will you cast off your Son for a Vertue, you ought rather to prize him for?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Jeff.</hi></speaker>
<p>That Love can never be a Vertue, Mr. <hi>Lovely,</hi> that teaches a Child to trick his Parents.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<p>And I must second Mr. <hi>Lovely,</hi> Sir, the Captain has married a virtuous Woman, and I believe you'll confess a handsome one too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Jeff.</hi></speaker>
<p>Nay, I have nothing to say against her Virtue, nor her Beauty neither; she's a pretty Woman, that's the truth on't; if she had married any Body's Son but mine, I shou'd have wish'd her Joy with all my heart‚Äî‚ÄîOh thou graceless Wretch, get out of my sight.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<p><stage>Kneeling.</stage> I confess, Sir, I am unworthy of your Mercy, but throw my self wholly upon your good Nature and fatherly Affection, with this Resolution, never to attempt ought against your Pleasure more.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Jeff.</hi></speaker>
<p>No, Sir, nothing you can do for the future, shall either please, or displease me; mark that.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<p>Give us but your Blessing, Sir, and we shall never quarrel with Fortune for her Favours, Love shall supply that defect; my chief Concern shall be to shew my Duty, and by my Care to please you, prove the entire Affection I have for your Son; and that way make up the inequality of my Birth and Fortune.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Jeff.</hi></speaker>
<p>You shall never make up any thing with me, I promise you, Madam, whilst he is your Father‚ÄîDeath, marry my Slave?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trusty.</speaker>
<p>The name of Slave belongs not to us free-born People, Sir <hi>Jeffrey</hi>; but were I your Slave, she is not; for since the truth must out, she is no Child of mine, but Daughter to my Lord <hi>Belville</hi>; which I have brought up ever since she was three days old; her Mother dying in her Labour, and her Marriage being private, because she was much below my Lord's Quality; and He at that time under the tuition of a Father; He never made it publick, but put her into my hands to breed up as my own; when he came to his Estate, he purchas'd a thousand Pounds a Year, and settled it on her; which I have manag'd ever since, and now will deliver it up to Captain <hi>Constant.</hi> This I had told in the Infancy of their Loves; but that I saw your Son was not well with you, and did not then think him a Match good enough for her; but since he has over reach'd me, I hope you'll prove a Father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir <hi>Jeff.</hi></speaker>
<p>Is it possible! Od, Madam, I wish you Joy with all my Soul, Faith I do; and if this is matter of Fact, you shall find me a Father, <hi>Jack:</hi> You shall go to <hi>Flanders</hi> no more.</p>

<head>A <hi>SONG,</hi> by the <hi>Author,</hi> and sung by Mr. <hi>Dogget.</hi></head>

<l>Wou'd you ch<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="‚Ä¢" reason="illegible"/>se a Wife f<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="‚Ä¢" reason="illegible"/>r a happy Life,</l>
<l>Leave the Court, and the C<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="‚Ä¢" reason="illegible"/>untry take,</l>
<l>Where <hi>Dolly</hi> and <hi>She,</hi> young <hi>Molly</hi> and <hi>Prue,</hi></l>
<l>Follow <hi>Roger</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> a <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="‚Ä¢" reason="illegible"/>ilst Harvest goes on,</l>
<l>And merrily, merrily Rake.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Leave the <hi>London</hi> Dames, be it spoke to their Shames,</l>
<l>To lig in their Beds till Noon;</l>
<l>Then get up and firetch, then paint too and patch,</l>
<l>Some Widgeon to catch, then look on their Watch,</l>
<l>And wonder they rise up so soon.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Then Coffee and Tea, both Green and Bohea,</l>
<l>Is serv'd to their Tables in Plate;</l>
<l>Where their Tattles do run, as swift as the Sun,</l>
<l>Of what they have wone, and who is undone,</l>
<l>By their gaming, and sitting up late.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The Lass give me here, tho' brown as my Beer,</l>
<l>That knows how to govern her House;</l>
<l>That can milk her Cow, or Farrow her Sow;</l>
<l>Make Butter, or Cheese, or gather green Pease,</l>
<l>And values fine Cloaths not a Louse.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>This, this is the Girl, worth Rubies and Pearl;</l>
<l>This the Wife that will make a Man rich:</l>
<l>We Gentlemen need, no Quality Breed,</l>
<l>To squander away, what Taxes would pay,</l>
<l>In troth we care for none such.</l>

<speaker>Const.</speaker>
<l>Now I am happy‚Äî</l>
<l><hi>Belinda</hi> mine, and you my faults forgive;</l>
<l>'Tis from this moment I begin to live.</l>
<l>Love sprung the Mine, and made the Breach in Duty,</l>
<l>No Cannon Ball can execute like Beauty.</l>
<l>But I'll no more in search of Pleasures rove,</l>
<l>Since ev'ry Blessing is coÃÑmpriz'd in Love. <stage>Exeunt.</stage></l>
