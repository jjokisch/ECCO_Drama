<opener><salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>YOung Authors, like young Wives, are lyable to distrust their own Conduct in every thing; and, whilst they fear venturing too far, are apt to stop short, and rob their Benefactors of those Acknowledgments they justly deserve: Or, by useing too loose a Rein, unavoidably
<pb facs="3"/>
run into Adulation. But I need fear neither of these Censures, since your Modesty, which is so conspicuous, will pardon one, and your Character be a sufficient defence against t'other, for 'tis impossible to say more of you than you deserve.</p>
<p>To attempt your Character, wou'd be too daring an Undertaking; For what Pen, besides your own, cou'd express that just Thought, lively Fancy, flowing and easy Language, that adorn those Pieces, which, like inestimable Jewels, too valuable for common use, are reserv'd for the Entertainment of your happy Friends? Your luckly Genius in Poetry, and your peculiar tast for Musick, proclaim you the Muses Darling; for you they reserve their choicest Favours: And, indeed, without such Qualifications, no Man can have a true Relish for Productions of this kind; and the most Excellent Pieces, wou'd be entertain'd with Coldness and Contempt.</p>
<p><pb facs="4"/>
How I have perform'd in the following Scenes, is neither possible, nor proper for me to determine; 'tis Praise enough, that you have given me leave to lay it at your Feet, which I prefer before the vain Applause of clapping Multitudes; nor cou'd I ever excuse it, either to the World, or my self, if I slipt any opportunity of publishing the Honour you do me: 'Tis a Vanity we are all lyable to, and we glory in the Excellencies of our Patron. Besides the advantage, 'tis a piece of Justice due to this Poem, and my self, to fly for Sanctuary to one who is most apt to Pardon, because the most capable to Judge; and has himself not only approv'd, but also, by his inimitable Performance, Corrected and Refin'd upon the most pleasant parts of Poetry.</p>
<p>To conculde, Sir, (for I wou'd, above all things, avoid being too Prolix) give me leave to joyn my hearty Wishes with
<pb facs="5"/>
the rest of Mankind, for your long continuing, as you are, a great Incourager, and principle Ornament of all Polite Literature, and Gentile Accomplishments, to the unspeakable Happiness of all your Friends, among whom to find a place, is the highest Ambition of</p>

<l>WHat Hazards Poets run, in Times like these,</l>

<stage>Enter Colonel <hi>Manly.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Colonel.</speaker>
<p>HOW do Men labour to fool themselves! What Pains did I spare, or Excuse did I not invent, to perswade my Friends I was going another way, to get rid of their troublesome Ceremony, that wou'd have waited on me home; and all this for an Opportunity only of taking a Turn or two before this Window.</p>
<p>Oh Love! How powerful are thy Charms, thus to unman, and send me like a Boy, gaping after Imaginary Joys.</p>
<p>Not all the Hazards of a Soldier's Life cou'd half so much assect me, as the dreadful Apprehension of displeasing this Girl.</p>
<p>Whatever I do, whether I Eat or Drink, whether I Sleep or Wake, whether I'm at home alone, or abroad in Company, my Thoughts are still of her: She's always present, I can see nothing
<pb n="2" facs="9"/>
but her, I can hear nothing but her, I can think of nothing but her; and in short, I care for nothing but her.</p>
<p>'Tis Happiness enough for any Man to love and be beloved by such a Woman, She's so Beautiful, so Agreeable, and so Loving; yet so Virtuous, so Ch<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>st, and so Constant, that it her Fathers rigid Opposition were remov'd, nothing cou'd add to the Blessing lyes in store for me.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Capt. <hi>Bellmein,</hi> goes within two or three yards of the door, then stops short, looks up.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Capt.</speaker>
<p>Ho, this must be the House—But what the Devil am I the better for't, the Doors are lock'd, Windows bar'd, my Mistress asleep, and I may return like an Ass as I came, without so much as being dream'd of—Can Love, that never fails his Votaries at a pinch, inspire no Stratagem now? Egad I was never more able to offer him a plentiful Sacrifice; and did my Mistress know with what warm Desires I come, she'd meet me half way, or she deserves to dye a Maid.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>The more I think, I still perplex my self the more; like a poor Fly in a Spiders Web, by labouring to get loose, I work my self faster in the Toyl.</p>
<p>And why shou'd I struggle any longer with what I can't master? or desire to be without what I'm perswaded is the greatest Blessing in the World—</p>
<p>I'm resolv'd I will Love on— <stage>[Turns short upon the Captain.]</stage> Ha! a Man, and if I mistake not, mad <hi>Bellmein,</hi> whom I left at the Rose, he's upon some Amorous Design, but is too open to hide any thing from his Friend, I'll accost him.</p>
<p>Good-morrow Captain, I commend your early Industry, you are choosing some fortify'd piece of Virtue to lay a manly Siege to.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>Ha, Colonel, Good-morrow to you with all my heart: No, Faith, I never stay the Formality of a Siege; 'tis you honourable Lovers are forc'd to undergo that Drudgery; whene're I meet any, as I rarely do, that resist the shock of my first assault, I fairly draw off to the next, who are sure to surrender upon more easie Terms.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>So you take all by Storm, Plunder the Garrison, Fire their Quarters, and march off in Triumph.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>What I do can't be comprehended by constant p<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>leing Lovers.</p>
<p>They can't bear those strong Joys we suck from our lusty Draughts of Love; like weak-sighted Birds, they fly about in the twilight of Pleasure, not able to bear the Meridional Heat and Pleasure of it.</p>
<p><pb n="3" facs="10"/>
One kind glance crowns all your Hopes, and raises you to the highest Happiness; but then a Frown, or sower look, Colonel, throws you down again to despair. So that—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Have a care <hi>Captain,</hi> how far you launch out in this strain, lest you be too like our Modern Widows, who exclaim most against a second Husband, when they are just upon the point of having one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>So that from my laughing at honourable Lovers, as you call them, you wou'd learnedly infer I am one my self.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Nay Railery apart, it has been seriously observ'd that you are—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Very much alter'd of late.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>How! Faith I think my self the same Man, I have the same Appetites, the same Desires, that ever I had.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Ay, but you saunter about in Solitary places, avoid your Acquaintance, and when you can't escape them, art more uneasie than a rich Miser with a borrowing Friend: And here now I find you out of your way, addressing your self to senceless Wood and Stone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>Ay, my Friend, but this senseless Wood includes a more beautiful <hi>Daphne</hi> than e're the Delian God pursued, a Girl so bright, so sparkling, and what recommends her much more to me, so coming, <stage>[Embraces him]</stage> that had she liv'd in the days of <hi>Venus,</hi> she wou'd have rival'd that Goddess, and out-done her too in her own Attributes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Have a care you don't mis-place your Worship, for to my particular knowledge no such Person lodges in this House.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>To my more particular knowledge such a Person does lodge in this House, and in the Room that looks out at that Window too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Ha! <hi>Clarinda</hi> lodges there, 'tis true; but that she's such as he describes is false—Yet she's a Woman, and where Dissembling grows so much in use, Perfection must be a Stranger. I'll for a while lay by the implicit Lover for the more inquisitive jealous Man, and try him farther. <stage>[Aside.]</stage> Well, I may be deceiv'd, but how do you know you are not so too?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>Why Faith, since I know you to be an honest Fellow, and a Man of Honour, I don't care if I trust you with the Secret, upon condition your assistance shan't be wanting upon occasion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>'Slife I shall be drewn in to help him away with my Mistress. <stage>[Aside.]</stage> If she be such as you describe, I believe you will have no great occasion for help. But to the purpose.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="11"/>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>Why you must know that in this House lives a dam'd Positive ill-natu<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>'d old Fellow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>I know it too well, or by this time his Daughter had been out of your reach. <stage>[Aside.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>And that there's a young Lady, his Daughter, Neice, or something.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>A<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> very probable. What then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Way, that <gap resp="apex" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> my <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>er<gap resp="apex" extent="3 letters" disp="•••" reason="illegible"/>, that's all.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Well, but her Name—I'll yet believe <hi>Clarinda</hi> Innocent, and 'tis some one else he mistakes for her. <stage>[Aside.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>Nay, now faith Collonel you are unreasonable, you know 'tis not fair to tell Names.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Not tell me her Name! then I shall think you trin'd with me all this while, and scorn the Friendship I offer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>I'll rather tell you all I know, but as for her Name Faith and Troth I know no more hers than she does mine, her desire to be unknown her self, made her the less pressing, I suppose, so that we freely pass amongst our selves for <hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>Cloe,</hi> as you may see by this Song, if you'll be at the pains of Reading it; 'tis the last I sent her, and tho' inconsiderable in it self, receives from her Voice inestemable value.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>O' my Soul, the very Song I heard <hi>Clarinda</hi> sing, 'tis she past all doubt.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>What, at a stand <hi>Colonel!</hi> ha<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> What means all this Concern?</p>

<p>'Tis very w<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ll—d'hear, do you Marshal them in order before this Window, and see they be ready to strike up as soon as I give the Word.</p>

<p>What the Devil's here, another Lover? What think you now, <hi>Colonel,</hi> your Mistress m<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>st be more than Woman if she can hold out against such a formal Seige.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>This <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>op I know too well to be jealous of, and know her so far from encouraging him, that her Fathers Authority which countenances him, can scarce procure him Common Civility from her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>Hist, the thing opens.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Well, 'tis an unspeakable Happiness we Men of parts
<pb n="6" facs="13"/>
enjoy above the rest of Mankind: By our good Management we make our access to every thing we admire, easy and certain: How many thick-skul'd Fellows are content to dream of their Mistresses, while I take a more secure Method, and wake her in the Morning with Harmonious Musick.</p>
<p>I wonder how the Ladies can suffer these Idle Fellows that take no more Pains to please them; for my own part, I believe I have something extraordinary in me that makes me so acceptable to all the Women I come in Company with.—Well Musick!</p>
<p>I hope you will all show your selves Masters in your Performance, come strick up: Ah! Merciful <hi>Apollo,</hi> what a hideous noise you make; there's a found fitter to storm a Breach with, than approach a Ladies slumbers. Play some soft Air, a consort of Flutes wou'd have done well.</p>
<stage>[While the Musick plays he uses a great many odd postures, seeing the door open, the Musick ceases, and he runs to meet <hi>Lucinda's</hi> Maid.]</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coll.</speaker>
<p>How, the Door open?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Ha! my dear Angel, How does my Goddess receive my Morning Sacrifice?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>As she does every thing that comes from the incomparable Sir <hi>William Mode,</hi> with particular Marks of favour in Private, tho' she's oblig'd to lay great restraint on her Carriage in Publick, to appear cold to him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>But methinks she need not be so reserv'd, since I have her Fathers Consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Ay, 'tis that makes her so; for his cross humour shou'd she show the Affection she realy has for you, wou'd make him run counter to what he so eagerly pursues now out of meer Opposition: For he never oppos'd Colonel <hi>Manly,</hi> till she express'd some liking for him; and now she fears, shou'd she own her Love for you, 'twou'd prove as fatal to her hopes, therefore begs you by me to take all Indifference in publick for perticular marks of favour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Well, I'll take your Advice, and sweet Mrs. <hi>Flora</hi> let me intreat you to accept of this small acknowledgement for favours I have receiv'd by your means.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Flo.</speaker>
<p>Oh! Lord, Sir, I vow I'm asham'd; but I shall be always ready to do you good Offices with my Lady. Sir, your Servant.</p>

such ug<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>y falshood. For thee, or any Man, she might have some plea; but this sign of a Man! to fall so low argues a very deprav'd Appetite: S'death I can't bear the thoughts on't.</p>
</sp>

<p>Have a little Patience, and every small discovery will help you forward to your lost Liberty: Before to Morrow Night I'll lay such convincing proofs before your Eyes, as shall infallibly compleat your Cure.</p>

<p>Ha, ha, Drunken <hi>Toper</hi> Reeling home after a Nights deboach, sure he's no Lover, 'twou'd be impossible for the Blind god to find his heart for the fumes of Wine; besides, 'tis so indifferent to every thing else there's no taking it but with a Bottle.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Ha, <hi>Toper,</hi> thou holdest thy own yet I see.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Top.</speaker>
<p><hi>Colonel,</hi> good Morrow, I wish you hold your own, Boy, for I met a thing in the next Street may chance undermine your foundation, one who says he can do more in one Night, than you in all the days of the Week.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Top.</speaker>
<p>Why I met Sir <hi>William Mode</hi> big with success, returning from <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who, he says, encourages his address in private, and only favours you in publick, to egg her Father on to Consumation with him; and this he purchas'd with a Serenade.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>S'death does he boast of his success, and must my Misfortune be the subject of the Coxcomb's Railery? Am I publish'd to the World as a blind for his designs? Hell and Furies, 'tis not to be born: I'll after him immediately, and were every Vanity about him a <hi>Hercules,</hi> I'd force my way thro' them all to stop that foul breath of his. <stage>[Going.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>Hold, hold, you will but widen the Sore you design to heal, 'twill be no hard matter from the Coxcomb's fruitful Impertinence to take another occasion for quarreling, and then pay old scores; or if it be my luck first to meet the opportunity, you may be sure I'll throw in a hearty Thrust for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Top.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Sir, you may save your self the labour of quarreling, for he won't answer Expectation, I asure you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>A Coward; Nay then he shall dance a minute the length of the Street, while I beat time upon his back-side.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="8" facs="15"/>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Hang him, he's not worth our Resentment: Prithee <hi>Toper,</hi> what is he, for I have but barely seen him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toper.</speaker>
<p>In the first place, he's a meer Compound of Powder, Paint and Affectation, so persum'd, you may smell him a Mile, he thinks every Woman in Love with him, and will allow no Man to claim a share in ought above a Chamber-maid; or stand in Competition with his Parts or Person.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>And yet not fight, say you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toper.</speaker>
<p>Fight, no, no, he hates the sight of a drawn Sword, as much as I do that of an empty Bottle. He will sometimes pretend to Courage, as some Women will to Honour and Honesty, tho' their Inclinations tend to neither, no more than mine to Matrimony. He has 4000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, which he spends in Intrigues, sine Cloths, and Musick. And he has always as many Fiddlers at his heels, as a general, Officers at his <hi>Lovee.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Whose attendance is better rewarded, I fancy, no doubt they taste the Fruits of their labours sweetly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toper.</speaker>
<p>I'my Conscience I believe they deserve it, for who becomes his Favourite, must use as many Complements as wou'd purchase a Maidenhead, tho' the Womans design was Marriage. Oh that Fortune shou'd be so liberal to such a Fool, when so many honest <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ellows sit in a Coffee-house all the Evening, for want of Money to go to the Tavern.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Riches are the common Chance of Knaves and Fools, Fortune is rarely favourable to a Man of Sense, 'tis with difficulty and danger they purchase a Smile from that Fickle Mistress, but Fools are still her care.</p>
<p>I shall take more notice of this Fellow the next time I see him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Toper.</speaker>
<p>Which may be this Morning if you will, for he just now invited me to an Entertainment of Musick, that is to be perform'd at his Chamber by some of the best Masters; there will be Champaign Boy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap.</speaker>
<p>Will you go Colonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col.</speaker>
<p>Not I; the Conversation of Town-Ladies; who entertain you with the Opinions of fifty Fools, of their Wit and Beauty, and how manag'd by them to their ruin, wou'd be a thousand times more acceptable to me, than the medly Chat of Fops and Fiddlers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<stage>Enter <hi>Clarinda</hi> and her Cousin <hi>Emilia,</hi> undress'd as wak'd by the Serenade.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>Dear <hi>Emilia,</hi> you ask so many questions, prithee have some pitty, and spare me a little.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>Dear Cousin, do you pitty me, and answer me a little.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>I have answer'd you these three days you have been in Town, more Questions than all the Astrologe<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>s and Philomaths in <hi>London</hi> cou'd resolve in a month.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>And I have as many more to ask before I can be satisfied: I'd fain know the cause of all this alteration, why so much uneasinels, and so much Spleen? Never pleas'd but when you are displeas'd, nor like your Company, but when you are alone. In short, I have observ'd—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>What have you observ'd, Cousin?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>Why that your Father is never well, but when talking to you of Sir <hi>William;</hi> nor you pleas'd, but when you are thinking of some body else.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>Oh, How-inquisitive are Girls!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>Oh, how reserv'd are Lovers!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>Prithee, Cousin, learn to be more Serious.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>Prithee, Cousin, learn to be more free.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>Then you positively believe I am in Love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>Positively.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>And with—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>Another-guess'd Man than your Father designs for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>And nothing—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>Will perswade me to the contrary.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>Why then I am; and since 'tis in vain to hide it from you, <hi>Emilia,</hi> I'll try you with that confidence I hitherto thought you too young for.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>Alas she little thinks I have as great Intrigues of my own, as any she can trust me with, tho' I have been but three days in Town. <stage>[Aside.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>I am, as you see Cousin, besieg'd night and day, by two as different as night and day; one in the head of innumerable Fopperies and Insolencies, attacks me with the assurance of a Conqueror, before he enters the Field; being supported by the harsh Authority of a rigid Father. The other, after a thousand obsequious Demonstrations of Love at respectful distance, courts to be admitted mine, rather than seeks to have me his.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>I'my Conscience were it my case, I shou'd not be at a stand which to choose, there being such apparent difference.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>Nay, there is more yet; for one is Generous and Brave, the other Cowardly and Pittiful; one Judicious, t'other Impe<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>tinent;
<pb n="10" facs="17"/>
one Const<gap resp="apex" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>t, <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>other Whimsical; one a Man of Sense, t'other a Block<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ead; one admir'd by all, t'other ridicul'd by all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>One, I suppose, is the Gentleman that gave the Serenade, Sir <hi>William,</hi> of whom I have heard so much since I came to Town, but t'other, <hi>Clarinda,</hi> I fear is no where to be found, such Men appear but as they say the Phenix does, not above one in an Age.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>And that ours has one in him, the Judicious part of Mankind bears me witness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>Lovers, <hi>Clarinda,</hi> like People in motion, fancy every thing t<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ey see moves as they do; and may be from the knowledge of your own Principles and Resolutions, you from your Notion of his—Now cou'd I almost find in my heart to discover my own Intrigue, it'twere only to let her see, there are Men that equal, if not exceed hers, but that I'm asham'd of its forwardness in so snort a time, <stage>[aside.]</stage> But how comes it, Cousin, that we never see this Man?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>Before you came to Town, my Father forbid him the House, with any farther Pretentions to me, upon Sir <hi>William</hi>'s account, to whom his Honour was engag'd before he saw him, or else I believe his Follies wou'd have out-weigh'd his Estate, for he you know—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>I know too much of him, for I have seen him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>So you have t'other too, he was one of the two that bow'd to us t'other night from the side-box, and of whom you have since been so inquisitive, tho' I never let you into the Secret till now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>Of one of those, I know a Secret which! believe you are a Stranger to, and which I wou'd not for the World discover, till I know more on't. <stage>[Aside.]</stage> If that be he, I like him as well as you can, but I think a Gentleman of Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Estate, shou<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>d not seem to contemptible.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>O dear Cousin don't name him, <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>or besides the particular Aversion I have for him, 'twould beget in the World a very slender Opinion of my Sense, shou'd I encourage such a Fop.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>O quite contrary; for Women of Sense strive to distinguish themselves, by their choice of Asses fit to bear their Burdens: Besides, Cousin, if you hate him, you can never get it in your power to torment him, more than by marrying him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>That would be making my self uneasie, purely to trouble another; No, no, I must have some Contrivance to expose him, and our Neighbour Mrs. <hi>Plotwell</hi> shall help me in it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Em.</speaker>
<p>Does that Lady still continue her Persecution of <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ops?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<p>With as much address and success as ever; and her pleasant accounts of her feign'd Intreagues, makes her very entertaining Company; she hates Sir <hi>William Mode,</hi> and I am sure will assist in any thing. I never had a stronger Temptation to Disobedience than now, Love and Merit plead on <hi>Manly</hi>'s side, Reason too approves my Choice;
<pb n="11" facs="18"/>
the other's an empty nothing, a meer Talker, we'll shew his right side, expose him, shall we not my Dear.</p>

<stage>Enter Sir <hi>William</hi> in a Night-gown, looking in his Glass.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>THis rising early is the most confounded thing on Earth, nothing so destructive to the Complexion. Blister me, how I shall look in the side box to night, wretchedly impair my Vigour.— <stage>[Looking in the Glass all the a bile.]</stage> Yet it adds something of a languithing Air, not altogether unbecoming, and by Candle-light may do mischief; but I must stay at home to recover some colour; and that may be as well laid on too; so 'tis resolv'd, I will go. Oh 'tis an unspeakable Pleasure to be in the side box, or crowd to the Stage, and be distinguish'd by the Beau's of Quality; to have a Lord fly into ones Arms, and kiss one as amorously as a Mistress: Then tell me aloud, that he din'd with his Grace, and that he and the Ladies were so fond of me, they talk'd of nothing else. Then says I, my Lord, his Grace does me too much Honour—Then my Lord,—Pox on this Play, 'tis not worth seeing; we han't been seen at <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>'other House to-night; and the Ladies will be disappointed, not to receive a Bow from Sir <hi>William.</hi> He, he, he, says I, my Lord, I'll wait upon your Lordship.

<sp>
<speaker>Top.</speaker>
<p>Impair my vigor! ha, ha, very pritty Faith; Prithee where did'st get that Affirmative?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>'Tis my own, at the purchase of some days study, for to use another Man's Oath, is, in my Opinion, as undecent, as wearing his Cloths: And to be in the Road of the vulgar, is beneath a Gentleman, who, in my Judgment, ought to be as much distinguish'd by his Expressions, as by his Coach and Livery.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap. Bell.</speaker>
<p>Right, Sir, for since every Body that has Mony enough, sets up an Equipage, a Gentleman ought to sind out some other way of distinguishing himself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>O' my Conscience they will ape us in that too, for they ape so proud of following their betters, that they even tread upon their heels: not a formal Cit, or awkard Lawyers Clerk, that <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>on' Cour<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> the Cook-wench a quarter for Oil and Flower enough to ga<gap resp="apex" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>ish <gap resp="apex" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>t his Wig for a day, that he may Impudently mimick a Beau; if 'twe<gap resp="apex" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/> not beneath me, I cou'd kick such Animals to a Jelly.</p>

</sp>
<sp>

<p>Ay, that may be; but 'tis not a Gentleman's business; that always wears a Sword, and has some half dozen of Footmen at his heels, to kick and cuff; nor stand and consider whether the Mechanick

<p>Now wou'd this Ass, rank Coward as he is, if not crab'd by the Law, kill a hundred Men honester and stouter than himself, only because they don't wear Swords, or are not so sinical.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Instruments! their very hands, their di<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ty clothes, are Instruments of Mischief. Lookee, Sir, I'll make it very plain to you, I may lawfully kill a Man in my own defence that comes A<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>m'd, <hi>in Terrorem,</hi> to Rob me of Fifty Pound.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap. Bell.</speaker>
<p>Right, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>You allow that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Top.</speaker>
<p>We do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Then I'll prove the <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>est in an instant; I have a new suit on that cost me <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ifty Pound, here comes thundering by a di<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ty Drayman with his Cart, that puts me in bodily fear, and rushing rudely by, da<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>bs all my Clothes, so that I can't wear them any more; now here's Fifty Pound lost by this Rascals dirty Chothes, if I don't prevent it by <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>unning him through the Body.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Cap. Bell.</speaker>
<p>How! kill a Man for wea<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ing dirty Clothes, ha, ha, ha, the Law makes better Provision for Men's Live<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>The Law shou'd make better provision for Men's Clothes too; for the Insolence of the Vulgar is insufferable, and if one or two of them were made examples, the rest wou'd be more Cautious.</p>
<p>One Night after Play, I waited on a Lady from the Box to her Coach, comes a clumsy Cit, with a paultry Mask out of the Gallery, rush'd against me, threw down the Ladies Page, brusht all the Powder out of my Wig, then cry'd ha, ha, ha, we have ruin'd the Beau; had I been a Lord, I wou'd have run him through the Guts, but to be try'd by a <hi><gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>iddlesex-Jury</hi> is the Devil.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Top.</speaker>
<p>Ay—these vulgar, as you call them, have a greater respect for Men's Lives, than to suffer that Man to escape that kills one of them. But I suppose your Principle concern rises from your loss of the Ladies favour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>It had no such essect on her, I assure you, Sir; whereever I get sooting in a Ladies Esteem, I stand too firm to be justled out by a Cit; as for Instance, I'll give you another adventure of mine, Being engag'd by Appointment to meet a Lady at <hi>White's,</hi> and detain'd by some extraordinary business, the Lady chanc'd to be there in her Coach as soon as I arriv'd in mine, so that lighting out of my Coach to go to hers, a nasty Fellow running just against me,
<pb n="14" facs="21"/>
almost beat me backward; and, tho' he did it designedly, yet cry'd Zounds, can't you see! Your Wig blinds you does it! so taking one side, gave it such a toss over my Shoulder, that, had not the Lady been passionatly in Love with my Person, the disorder I appear'd in might have spoil'd my Amour.</p>

<p>No, 'tis an intimate Friend of his, one as Whimsical as himself, and truly fit for no other company; he made shift in a Months time, to purchase the displeasure of most of the Quality in Town, in spight of some excellence he has in Musick; and now is become sit entertainment for such fops as this, who, after the strictest engagement, will be put off with trifling excuses. <stage>[<gap resp="oxf" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>side.]</stage></p>

<p>He was an Attorney's Cl<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>rk, but his Father dying, left him a small Estate; he bought out his Time, and set up for a Fortune: There's scarce a Match-maker in the whole Town, but has had a

<p>I beg your Pardon, Sir—Great Persons, I remember, do court by Proxy.</p>

<p>I'll show you what she us'd to write to me <stage>[Pulling out Letters]</stage> Here—no, hold, this is from a Baronets Lady, with whom I had an Intreague: This is it—no—this is from a Merchants Wife, a City Animal, that pretends to a nearer Tast than those of her Levell, and wou'd fain have a Child with the Air of a Gentleman, but I beg'd her Pardon, I left her to the Brutes of her own Corporation, for I will have nothing to do with the Body Politick.</p>

<p>Rediculous Monster.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>You are very severe upon the City, Sir, but where is the Letters you was about to show us?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ogle.</speaker>
<p>Ha! upon my Life, Gentlemen, I put 'em into my Scrutore this Morning. But as I was saying, Mrs. <hi>Cuple</hi> had a hundred Guinea's
<pb n="17" facs="24"/>
of me for the management of that business; and if the Lady had not died, I'm certain she had been my Wife. Well, I shall ne'er forget what languishing looks she'd cast at me at Church; then put up her Fan to her Face and sigh, as much as to say, you are the only Man can make me happy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, extraordinary Symptoms Faith, 'twas very unlucky that you cou'd not come to the speech of her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>'Twas my ill Fortune, but I am so us'd to Disappointments, that I bear them the easier; what I have met with, would have broke the Heart of some Men; the Lady <hi>Wealthy</hi> was perfectly forc'd from me by her Uncle, else I'm convinc'd she had now call'd me Husband.</p>

<p>Why what hopes had you of her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Hopes: Why the greatest in the World; she prais'd me to every body she thought knew me; she said I had the hansomest Foot and Leg she ever saw, the best manner of Dressing, and the genteelest Carriage—She said she could hardly believe me an English-man, without doing Violence to her Reason.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Oh very well, Sir; tho', I believe, not so well as she desires, and I hope to do, in a little time.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Say you so, Sir?</p>

<p>Then you are very well acquainted, Sir.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Ogle.</speaker>
<p>Yes, very well acquainted, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Sir, can you introduce me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ogle.</speaker>
<p>Faith, Sir, not very well, for I never spoke to the Lady in my Life.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>How! never spoke to her: Why I understood you, that you was well acquainted, Sir; Ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ogle</speaker>
<p>Why so I am, Sir—Why is it not possible to be acquainted without speaking, Gentlemen? Why a Friend of mine lay all night with a Lady, and never saw her Face, nor knows not who she is to this moment; now I think seeing is of greater consequence than speaking. But you shall hear how far I'm acquainted with this Lady; I lodge at her Milleners, you must know, and I have several times pass'd through the Shop when she has been in't, and as soon as my Back has been turn'd, she has always taken an occasion to commend me, and say something extraordinary in my praise, which my Landlady never fail'd to tell me, but with such an Air, as if she was desired
<pb n="18" facs="25" ana="y"/>
to tell me. Then if she sees me walking here—as I generally do every Morning, she straight repairs to the Window—thus do you see—stend you there—Now suppose me the Lady—you look up at my Window and walk thus, do you see?—Then I run to the Window thus—clap my Arms a-cross thus—and hang my Head thes—turn my Eyes languishing thus—as who shou'd say, if it were the Custom for Women to make the first Addresses, I wou'd <gap resp="apex" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> be<gap resp="apex" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>en you up.</p>

<p>Why is this nothing, Gentlemen?</p>

<p>Nothing at all; and six to four the Lady never thinks on you.</p>
</sp>

<p>Oh Lord, give me breath—let me have a little Air, or I shall dy—so—, well, Where have you been all this while? And how have you spent your time? Lord I think I have a Thousand Questions to ask in one Breath.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>And I have as many to ask you, but can't spare time now; some more pressing private business wou'd take me wholly up, fitter for the next Room—Shall we retire? <stage>[pulling her.]</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Plot.</speaker>
<p>No, stand off, if we retire, it must be upon Conditions agreed to before-hand.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart Child, I was never better condition'd for a Ladies service in all my Life; lookee here—here are Conditions, <stage>[shows a purse of Gold.]</stage> Observe the Conditions, and let's be happy; tho' I never thought you Mercinary till now.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Plot.</speaker>
<p>I'm not so much displeas'd with your mistaking me, as I shou'd be with any one else; for besides some allowance for your Humour, your absence from Town so long, may excuse you from the knowledge of my present Principles and Designs; and as great a Libertine as you profess your self, I know the awful Lustre of Virtue has always met with due respect from you, and that respect is the only Condition I require you to observe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Ha hy, Why what the Devil is here, my old Mistress setting up for Virtue? For Heaven's sake, What do you mean, Madam?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Plot.</speaker>
<p>As I say, Sir, that I'm no more what you once knew me; since your abode in <hi>Ireland,</hi> my Uncle, who kept me from my Estate, is dead, thank Heaven, and I now am Mistress of a Fortune sufficient for my use; and, had I possest it sooner, I never had been what I was: But now, I scorn Mankind on terms like those, all Innocent Diversions I freely take, I keep the best Company, pay and receive Visits from the highest Quality, People who are better bred than to examine into past Conduct.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20" facs="27"/>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Hy! I find then that Reputation is never lost but in an empty Pocket; well then thou'rt grown Virtnous, and I must never hope for the Blessing again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Plot.</speaker>
<p>Never, but talk as free as you will, do but observe the Rules of Modesty; I like your Company and Conversation as well as ever, I'm not so Rigedly Virtuous to appear a Saint, I can lanch one and laugh with you sometimes; <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ay, perhaps contribute to your Mirth. I'll give you a short account <gap resp="apex" extent="1 span" disp="〈…〉" reason="illegible"/> my time, in exposing to publick view, all the Fo<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ies or your Sex, that part of them, I mean, whose Vanity brought them under my lash, such whose Tiffany Natures are so easily impos'd upon, to have the commonest Drabs in Town topt upon them for Women of Quality.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>This Town does abound with such as you speak of.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Plot.</speaker>
<p>Oh, did you but see with what variety 'tis furnish'd, and how universally all Men are infected with an itch after Quality, you'd be convinc'd there's not one, from the Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, down to a Life-guard Man, but thinks himself sufficiently qualified to deserve the favour of any Lady in St. <hi>James</hi>'s. I pass'd upon one for a Countess, upon another for a Dutchess, another a Baronets Lady, and so forth—ha, ha, the poor Fools were lost in a cloud of Ignorance, rais'd by the hurry of their own Expectations.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>Why, truly it wou'd surprise a Man, that never convers'd with ought above a Pit-Mask, to be invited to a Ladies Bed, ha, ha, ha.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Plot.</speaker>
<p>Such awkard Address, and the means every Man finds to recommend himself by, one for Secrecy, 'tother Wit, a third his Person, so every Fool finds something to think valuable in himself:</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>There's your Weakly, Finieking, Dancing, Singing, Witty Fop, who values himself upon Writeing Bilitdoux.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Plot.</speaker>
<p>And thinks his Company so very agreeable, that he Persecutes People to death, before they can get rid of his troublesome Impertinence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>His chiefest Tallent consists in the Repertee of an Intrigue. But then there's your old harden'd Sinner.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Plot.</speaker>
<p>Ay, he Crys up Secrecy and Security, his Years, Wrinkles, and distorted Body, are sufficient defence against a slanderous Tongue; he values himself more for what he has been, than for what he is, recommending himself upon his knowledge and experience.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bell.</speaker>
<p>And his great Judgment in the happy management of an Intrigue. But the Man of Sense.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. Plot.</speaker>
<p>Him all Women ought to shun, that fears coming under his power; he approaches Securely.</p>

Lord, Lord, who would be plagu'd with Children, I'm resolv'd she shall Marry Sir <hi>William</hi> to Morrow; why she'll have as many Fellows at her Heels, as her Collonel has Soldiers waiting for their Pay; why, what a Medly of Suitors has she? Fighters, Fools, and Fops. Well, since you are so sickle, Mistress, I'll fix you presently, or Marry my self. Mr. <hi>Roarwell</hi> was wishing me to a Cousin of his, who will be in Town to day; adod if this perverse Baggage make one Scruple of obeying my Will, I'll have her, and try if a Mother-in-Law won't hamper her; but I'll in, and send for Sir <hi>William</hi> immediately.</p>

<p>Oh don't fear that, since you only wear it to do your selves Justice; for Justice can never be dishonourable.</p>

<p>You are not Insensible, Cousin, how resoloutely my cruel Father Persecutes me with this Fop; therefore, since poor <hi>Clarinda</hi> is in all this Danger, I my own Knight-Errant, and thou my trusty Squire, will March <hi>Encavalier,</hi> and deliver the distress'd Damsel, by beating the Giant into a Pigmy, then be our own Heralds, and proclaim our Victory to my Father, and hollow the Coward so loud in his Ears, that we will shame him out of all Thoughts of this Fool.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>If that don't do, my Plot shall, <hi>Roarwell</hi> has broke it to him, as I told you.</p>

<p>They are as like as two Pees in every thing but Estate, and in that Sir <hi>William</hi> outdoes him.</p>

<p>He is the very Quintessence of Fopery; his Name and Nature suits exactly, for he's a nice Observer of the Modes; his Valet is forc'd to Counterfeit a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> or he would turn him away.</p>

<p>I know Sir <hi>Wllliam</hi>'s a Coward, I had been often told so, and to prove it, I sent him a Challenge, as from one Mr. <hi>Roughly,</hi> his Man said it put him into such a Consternation he shou'd never forget him, he sent me word that he'd meet me on <hi>Calais</hi> Sands, and give me Satisfaction, Ha, ha, ha.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Emil.</speaker>
<p>I am sure that Gentleman that bow'd to us in the Side-Box the first Night I came to Town, has ever since pursued me with most violent Love; and I must confess I lik'd his Humour so well, that I could not be displeas'd with his playing the Fool.</p>

<p>Where did you see him next? How got he an Opportunity?</p>

<speaker>Emil.</speaker>
<p>Why then I went to the Play in a Mask, purpose for a little Diversion, and 'twas my Fortune to sit next him inthe Pit, where, during the Play-time he entertain'd me with the prettiest Discourse in the World, and when 'twas done he wou'd not part with me till I had promis'd to write to him, and I cou'd not help keeping my Word if I was to be Hang'd,—But finding him false to you, I hate him; this Letter I have writ to upbraid him.</p>

<p>Did he never ask your Name, nor tell you his?</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Right, I think a Gentleman ought to wear a Sharp for a terror to the Vulgar, and because 'tis the Fashion; but he shou'd never use it but as an Ornament, and part of his Dress, I hope to see it as much a Fashion to Fight with Files, as 'tis to Fence with them. If I was a Member of Parliament, I'de bring in a Bill against

<p>Why do you laugh Gentlemen?

</sp>

<p>And by my Consent, he that draws a Sword out of the Immediate Service of the Queen should be hang'd.</p>

<p>This is a hearing of a Duel indeed,—Files Ha, ha, ha, you was resolv'd to prevent Murder; you need never fear the Exaltation of the Gallows, for your Courage reaches but to a Chance Medly at most.</p>

<speaker>C. Man,</speaker>
<p>Prethee who were those Gentlemen Sir <hi>William,</hi> methinks they us'd you very familiarly.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
<p>Men of no Honour you may conclude Collonel, else they would not have abus'd Gentlemen, when they was defenceless.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col. Man.</speaker>
<p>Right, but why wou'd you be defenceless? Faith Sir <hi>William</hi> if this News reaches your Mistress's Ears, it will ruin you in her Favour. Take this for a Rule, the less regard you have for your Honour the more you sink in the Esteem of your Mistress, for all Women hate a Coward; you ought to be forbid the Habits of Men, who can be guilty of Esseminency that even Women would blush at.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Why Gentlemen, I think Passive Valour sits well enough upon Men that have Estates, and have a Mind to live and enjoy them.</p>

<speaker>C. Bell.</speaker>
<p>Ha! There's a lucky hit Collonel; she Invites me to come to her Lodging, and her Servant should be ready to convey me into her Apartment. Here read it Man, now you may convince your self.—Egad if I were not a damn'd Honest Fellow to my Friend, now cou'd I pass three hours the most agreeably in the World. Pox on me for a prating Coxcomb, could not I have held my Tougue. Well what think you of it Collonel?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Col. Man.</speaker>
<p>It is not her Hand, but that's nothing, she might disguise that to conceal it from me. I know not what to think,

<p>I have us'd all the Arguments in my Power to Convert her from this Formality, but in vain, she's as averse to the Fashions, as other Women are fond of 'em; but I hope your Neice and Daughter will work a Reformation in her.</p>

<p>Well, well, thee wilt never leave thy rediculous Jests; I say that Mankind were not made for Foppery and Pride, but to do good in their Generation,—Prethee shew me one Text of Scripture for the Fashions, or where Jewels are commanded, or what Holy Matron ever had a Valet, to dress 'em, as they say the <hi>French</hi> Ladies have, Oh monstrous Fashion!—No no, our devoutest Women wore course Linnen, or rather none at all.</p>

<p>Oh! Sir, my Scruples are not founded upon Religion; but I'll tell you, the last Long Vacation, I made the Tour of <hi>Paris,</hi> where I receiv'd such extraordinary Marks of Civility from the <hi>French</hi> Court, particularly from the Duke of <hi>Berry,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and the Duke—and from the Governour of <hi>Callis,</hi> such extravagant Obligations; But above all, from the Governour's Daughter—That upon my Soul, I cannot descend so far from the <hi>Punctilio's</hi> of
<pb n="42" facs="49"/>
Honour, to go against 'em; But against <hi>Spain,</hi> I—Ha! the Coll. I'm resolv'd to fight him however, Death, Hell and Furies: Draw Sir!</p>

<p>Why what a Metamorphus is this? Is this your Voluntier, Serjant?</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Serj.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir, but if you had not come as you did, he had been gone, for I found his Courage began to sink.</p>

<p>Courage, Sir, Z'death, Sir, I'll Box with you, <stage>[Pulling off his Neckcloth.]</stage> you have got my Sword, but no matter for that, I ll Fight it out at Fists; Lose a Fortune for want of Fighting, No!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coll.</speaker>
<p>I'll Box you, you Dog; give me the Cane, <stage>[To the Serjant.]</stage> Sirrah, I'll make Mummy of your Bones, I'll make you forswear sauntering after Fortunes, nay you shall not dare to look towards the House where they live, or so much as think of them.</p>

<p>Oh Lord Sir! spare that, and I will not think of 'em upon my Faith, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Coll.</speaker>
<p>Nay one thing more you must promise, which is, to resume your w<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>nted Cowardice, and betake you to your Desk again. Go take Money of the Men you mean to Cozen; talk little, except when you are paid for't, 'tis an Antidote against Beating; keep your Hand from your Sword, and your Landresses Petticoats, and you'll live at peace.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Og.</speaker>
<p>I will Collonel—Give me Wisdom that is beaten into a Man, for that sticks to him Egad. I'm wiser than a Justice of Peace; your Precepts are very learned, Sir. I'm your humble Serva<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>t—Farewel Sword, and welcom Tongue again. Now can't I
<pb n="43" facs="50"/>
positively tell, whether 'tis best to be Couragious, or to have no Courage at all; Beaten if I Fight, and Beaten if I do not.—Now I think I know something of the Law, and yet if the Question was put to me I cou'd not Resolve it,</p>
<l><hi>But for my own part, I'll lay Courage down,</hi></l>
<l><hi>As all Men do, when they take up the Gown;</hi></l>
<l><hi>Cloak'd with the Law, I may securely <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>aul,</hi></l>

<p>Ay, but your Friends won't care that for you, <stage>[Snaping his Fingers.]</stage> for e're the second Bottle, you'll be calling, What's to pay?

<l>Made <hi>Men</hi> by <hi>Tay<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ors,</hi> and by <hi>Women, Fools:</hi></l>
<l>A <hi>F<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ckle, False,</hi> a <hi>Singing, Dancing</hi> Crew,</l>
<l>Nay now we hear they've <hi>Smiling Masters</hi> too;</l>
<l>Just now a <hi>Frenchman</hi> in the Dressing Room,</l>
<l>From Teaching of a Beau to Smile, was come,</l>
<l>He shew'd five G<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>i<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ea<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>.—War'nt he rarely paid,</l>
<l>Thus all the World by <hi>Smiles</hi> are once betray'd;</l>
<l>The <hi>States Man</hi> Smiles on them he wou'd <hi>Undo,</hi></l>
<l>The Courtier's <hi>Smi<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>es</hi> are very seldom <hi>True,</hi></l>
<l>The <hi>Lovers</hi> Smiles too many do believe,</l>
<l>And Women <hi>Smile</hi> on them they wou'd Deceive;</l>
<l>When <hi>Trades-Men</hi> Smile, they safely <hi>Cheat</hi> with Ease,</l>
<l>And <hi>Smiling Lawyers</hi> never fail of <hi>Fees.—</hi></l>
<l>The Doctor's Look the Patient's Pain beguiles,</l>
<l>The Sick Man <hi>lives.</hi> if the <hi>Physician Smiles:</hi></l>
<l>Thus <hi>Smiles</hi> with Interest hand in hand do go,</l>
<l>He surest Strikes, that Smiling gives the Blow;</l>
<l>Poets, with us, this Proverb do Defy,</l>
<l>We live by <hi>Smiles,</hi> for if you <hi>Frown</hi> we die.</l>
<l>To Please you then shall be our chief Endeavour,</l>
<l>And all we ask, is but your Smiles for Ever.</l>

<l>Hold—I forget, The Author bid me say,</l>
<l>She humbly begs Protection for her Play:</l>
<l>'Tis Yours—She Dedicates, it to you all,</l>
<l>And sure you're too Gen'rous, to let it fall;</l>
<l>She hopes the Ladies will her Cause Maintain,</l>
<l>Since Virtue here has been her only Aim.</l>
<l>The Beaux, she thinks, won't fail to do her Right,</l>
<l>Since here they're taught with safety how to Fight.</l>
<l>She's sure of Favour from the Men of War,</l>
<l>A Soldier is her Darling Character;</l>
<l>To fear their M<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>rm<gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>rs then wou'd be absurd,</l>
<l>They only Mutiny when not Prefer'd:</l>
<l>But <gap resp="apex" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>et, I see, she does your Fury dread,</l>
<l>And like a Prisoner, stands with fear half Dead,</l>
<l>While you are Judges, do her Sentence give,</l>
<l><gap resp="apex" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> you're not pleat'd, she says she cannot live.</l>
<l>Let my Petition then for once prevail,</l>
<l>And let your gen'rous Claps her Pardon Seal.</l>
