<head>PROLOGUE,</head>
<byline>Written by Mr. HOLCROFT,</byline>
<byline>Spoken by Mr. BANNISTER, jun.</byline>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>PROLOGUES, with caustic touch, have often tried</l>
<l>To probe your spleen, prove knaves and fools allied;</l>
<l>Have twisted words and wit ten thousand ways,</l>
<l>To shew that these are most degenerate days!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>A different task be ours.—We'll prove that you</l>
<l>Are wise and happy. Nay! tho' strange, 'tis true!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>First on your <hi>safety</hi> think! now belles appear</l>
<l>By ample bulwarks guarded, front and rear!</l>
<l>Now male and female amble, side by side,</l>
<l>Exempt from harm, by breast-works fortify'd!</l>
<l>Here polygons defend Miss Molly's breast!</l>
<l>There horn-works hush the husband's fears to rest!</l>
<l>By ramparts, daily rais'd, he's freed from cares;</l>
<l>If he'll but grant sufficient for repairs.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Our strength thus prov'd, proceed we to disclose</l>
<l>How new-made wealth thro' new-made channels flows!</l>
<l>How rich we are, in medal-rust and rare things!</l>
<l>In copper coins, gilt pence and—Queen-Anne-farthings!</l>
<l>How shells, stuff'd monkies, and Cremonas old,</l>
<l>In hand of Auctioneer, are current gold!</l>
<l>He "Going! going!" cries. "The hammer's up!</l>
<l>"This fine antique! this Roman—<hi>caudle-cup!"</hi></l>
<l>A gem so rare makes connoisseurs turn pale,</l>
<l>Fearful, alike, to purchase or to fail!</l>
<l>Hope trembles, starts, from lip to lip rebounds,</l>
<l>Till down she's knock'd by—Ah!—one thousand pounds!</l>
<l>The envied purchaser, with joy e<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>ate,</l>
<l>Pays for his prize by—felling his estate!</l>
<l><pb facs="5"/>While <hi>Smirk,</hi> in florid style, words nicely plac'd,</l>
<l>Protests theee lot does, <hi>anner</hi> to his taste!<stage><hi>Mimick<gap resp="pdcc" extent="3 letters" disp="•••" reason="illegible"/></hi></stage></l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yes! sure you're happy! and should rest content,</l>
<l>Now landscapes are reduced fifteen per cent:</l>
<l>And Claude's and Titian's new-found wonders may</l>
<l>By new-made Peers be bought—if new-made Peers to pay.</l>
</lg>
<stage>Assuming sorrow.</stage>
<lg>
<l>One thing, indeed, may well your peace invade,</l>
<l>Pawnbrokers! threaten you to leave off trade!<stage><hi>W<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>t</hi></stage></l>
</lg>
<stage>Returning to his former chearful tone.</stage>
<lg>
<l>All things considered, now, while safety smiles,</l>
<l>And wealth inundates thus our Queen of isles;</l>
<l>While Vickery head defects so soon repairs,</l>
<l>And half unpeoples Greenland of her bears;</l>
<l>While exhibitions, galas and reviews,</l>
<l>Lisle-street, Vauxhall, the Abbey, Handel, Hughes,</l>
<l>Flutes, fiddles, trombos, double-drums, bassoons,</l>
<l>Mara, the speaking-figure, fish-balloons,</l>
<l>Earth-baths, live-eagles, such as never flew,</l>
<l><hi>L' Hercule du Roy!</hi> and General Jackoo!</l>
<l>While these create a round of such delight,</l>
<l>Sure, we may hope, you will not frown to-night!</l>
<l>While farces numerous as these go down,</l>
<l>Our farce may in its turn amuse the town;</l>
<l>And, smiling thus on Folly's vast career,</l>
<l>Sure not on us, alone, you'll be severe!</l>

<p>I Can't go at present, Mr. Jerome, for I expect my Lady every moment to ring, if I should be out of the way she will be an<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> and as I am but new in her service—</p>

<p>Do you consider that as a fault, b<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> Jerome?</p>

<sp>

<p>To be sure I do—For my par<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> think she had much better be too fond of us, <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> the rest of her sex are.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FLORA.</speaker>
<p>Pray, Mr. Jerome, what caused <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> aversion to the men?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you, Flora, if it wo'nt <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> you melancholy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FLORA.</speaker>
<p>Oh, no, Mr. Jerome—I like a <gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>¦lancholy story—I like dearly to cry, when it is <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> on my own account.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<p>Well then—When my Lady was <gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>¦ly fifteen she fell deep in love with a fine ha<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> some young fellow, inferior to her both in <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> and fortune; but my good old Lord, her fa<gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/> who doated upon her, was afraid a disapp<gap resp="pdcc" extent="4 letters" disp="••••" reason="illegible"/>¦ment might break her heart, and so c<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>nsente<gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> her having him; but he proved so bad a husb<gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/> that my poor old Master soon died with grief.</p>

<p>Poor man!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEROME.</speaker>
<p>Don't cry yet, there's someth<gap resp="pdcc" extent="3 letters" disp="•••" reason="illegible"/> worse to come—My Lady, on this, took such dislike to her husband, that he died of <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> too.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>FLORA.</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Jerome, this is <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> moving. <stage>cries.</stage></p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>EROME.</speaker>
<p>On this, my Lady made a vow to <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> herself up from the whole sex.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>LORA.</speaker>

</sp>

<speaker><gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>ROME.</speaker>
<p>And she immediately retired to this <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>y castle, where, except the house of Donna <gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>lla next door, we have not a neighbour for <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/>; and even there we are strangers—for my <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> I have never so much as seen Donna Isabella, <gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>changed a word with any of the servants since <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> came to the place—though indeed they have <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>een here above eight days.</p>

<p>Yes; Don Antonio lives here—then he is my Lady's uncle; and you know th<gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/> can be no fear of her falling in love with him, <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> he is a relation.</p>

<p>Delightful, Madam—I have been intro<gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>ced to the young Countess—I first communi<gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>ted the intelligence of the pretended plot form<gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>g against her to her waiting-woman, who was <gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>fficiently alarmed at it, to take me to her Lady <gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>mediately.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>ISABEL.</speaker>
<p>Very well.</p>

<p>And then, before I discovered what I had say, I made her promise not to betray me, <gap resp="pdcc" extent="3 letters" disp="•••" reason="illegible"/>ch she did most solemnly, and without the <gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>st reluctance—and now, Madam, says I, I <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> servant with your neighbour, Donna Isabella, <gap resp="pdcc" extent="3 letters" disp="•••" reason="illegible"/>ighty Lady, who turns every thing serious and <gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>ed into ridicule; and she has resolved to make <gap resp="pdcc" extent="3 letters" disp="•••" reason="illegible"/>t of you for pretending an aversion to men, <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> for that purpose she has procured recom<gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/>ndations for you to receive the visits of the <gap resp="pdcc" extent="3 letters" disp="•••" reason="illegible"/>ng Marquis her brother, but instead of him, <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> purposes to come herself, disguised as a man, <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/>vail on you to consent to be married to her, <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 letter" disp="•" reason="illegible"/> then throw off the mask, and make you and <gap resp="pdcc" extent="1 word" disp="〈◊〉" reason="illegible"/> vow the jest of the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>Your brother!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Yes—The Countess, from what you have told her, will suppose him a woman, receive him, and consequently suffer a thousand endearing familiarities; till, charmed by the graces of his mind and person, she shall love him without <hi>knowing</hi> it, and, when she detects the impostor, be unable to part with him.</p>

<p>And if she is like me, she'll think it the happiest day of her life—but have you prepared your brother how to act his part?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ISABEL.</speaker>
<p>He has nothing to <hi>act,</hi> being the very person he represents, and therefore shall not know of the art by which he is introduced—for, except being a little too attentive to dress and etiquette, a circumstance which, with his youthful appearance, favours our design, he is one of the mo<gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/> amiable young men in the world, and the le<gap resp="pdcc" extent="2 letters" disp="••" reason="illegible"/> idea of imposition would shock his honour, and put an end to my scheme.</p>
