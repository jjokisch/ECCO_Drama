<head>PROLOGUE.</head>
<stage>Spoken by Mr. W. MILLS.</stage>
<l>TO Night our comic MUSE the Buskin wears,</l>
<l>And gives her self no small Romantic Airs;</l>
<l>Struts in Heroics, and in pompous Verse,</l>
<l>Does the minutest Incidents rehearse;</l>
<l>In Ridicule's strict Retrospect displays,</l>
<l>The Poetasters of these modern Days:</l>
<l>When the big bellowing Bombast rends our Ears,</l>
<l>Which stript of Sound, quite void of Sense appears:</l>
<l>Or when the Fiddle Faddle Numbers flow,</l>
<l>Serenely dull, Elaborately low:</l>
<l>Either Extreme, when vain Pretenders take,</l>
<l>The Actor suffers for the Author's sake.</l>
<l>The quite tir'd Audience lose whole Hours, yet pay</l>
<l>To go un-pleas'd and un-improv'd away:</l>
<l>This being our Scheme, we hope you will excuse</l>
<l>The wild Excursion of the wanton Muse;</l>
<l>Who out of Frolic wears a mimic Mask,</l>
<l>And sets herself so whimsical a Task:</l>
<l>'Tis meant to please, but if it should offend,</l>
<l>It's very short, and soon will have an End.</l>

<l>He sleeps Supine amidst the Din of War:</l>
<l><pb n="10" facs="8"/>And yet 'tis not definitively Sleep;</l>
<l>Rather a kind of Doze, a waking Slumber,</l>
<l>That sheds a Stupefaction o'er his Senses;</l>

<l>Then nods and snores again: If this be Sleep,</l>

<p>My dear Friend! you entirely misapprehend me; I did not call the King, Dog by Craft, I was only going to tell you the Soldiers have just receiv'd their Pay, and are all as drunk as so many Swabbers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aldiboronti.</speaker>
<l>Give Orders instantly, that no more Money</l>

<l>To stupify their Souls into Sobriety.</l>
