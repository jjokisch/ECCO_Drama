<head>PROLOGUE,</head>
<byline>BY A FRIEND;</byline>
<byline>SPOKEN BY Mr. WADDY.</byline>
<sp>
<l>I COME not to announce a bashful maid</l>
<l>Who ne'er has try'd the drama's doubtful trade,</l>
<l>Who sees with flutt'ring hope the curtain rise,</l>
<l>And scans with timid glance your critic eyes;</l>
<l>My client is a more experienc'd dame,</l>
<l>Tho' not a Veteran, not unknown to Fame,</l>
<l>Who think your favours are an honest boast,</l>
<l>Yet fears to forfeit what she values most;</l>
<l>Who has, she trusts, some character to lose,</l>
<l>E'en tho' the woman did not aid the Muse;</l>
<l>Who courts with modest aim the public smile,</l>
<l>That stamp of merit, and that meed of toil.</l>
<l>At Athens once (our author has been told)</l>
<l>The Comic Muse, irregularly bold,</l>
<l>With living calumny profan'd her stage,</l>
<l>And forg'd the frailties of the faultless sage.</l>
<l>Such daring ribaldry you need not fear,</l>
<l>We have no Socrates to libel here.</l>
<l>Ours are the follies of an humbler flight,</l>
<l>Offspring of manners volatile and light;</l>
<l>Our gen'ral satire keeps more knaves in awe,</l>
<l>Our court of conscience comes in aid of law.</l>
<l>Here scourg'd by wit, and pilloried by fun,</l>
<l><hi>Ten thousand</hi> coxcombs blush instead of <hi>one.</hi></l>
<l>If scenes like these could make the guilty shrink,</l>
<l>Could teach unfeeling Folly how to think,</l>
<l>Check Affectation's voluble career,</l>
<l>And from cold Fashion force the struggling tear,</l>
<l>Our author would our loudest praise forego,</l>
<l>Content to feel within "what passes show,"</l>
<l>"But since" (she says) "such hopes cannot be mine,</l>
<l>"Such bold pretensions I must needs resign,</l>
<l>"Tell these great judges, of dramatic laws,</l>
<l>"Their reformation were my best applause;</l>
<l>"Yet if the heart my proud appeal withstands,</l>
<l>"I ask the humbler suffrage of their hands."</l>

<head><hi>SCENE I.</hi> <stage>An Apartment at Mr. <hi>NORBERRY's</hi></stage></head>
<stage><hi>Enter Sir</hi> WILLIAM DORRILLON, <hi>and Mr.</hi> NORBERRY.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker><hi>Mr.</hi> NORBERRY.</speaker>
<p>WHY blame me?—Why blame me?—My sister had the sole management of your daughter by your own authority; from the age of six years, till within eight months of the present time, when, in consequence of my sister's death, she was transferred to my protection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Your sister, Mr. Norberry, was a prudent, good woman—she never could instruct her in all this vice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Depend upon it, my dear friend, that Miss Dorrillon, your daughter, came to my house just the same heedless woman of fashion you now see her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>impatiently.</stage> Very well—'Tis very well.—But, when I think on my disappointment—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>There is nothing which may not be repaired. Maria, with you for a guide—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Me! She turns me into ridicule—laughs at me! This morning, as she was enumerating some of her frivolous expences, she observed me lift up my hands and sigh; on which she named fifty other extravagances she had no occasion to mention, merely to enjoy the pang which every solly of her sends to my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>But do not charge this conduct of your daughter to the want of filial love:—did she know you were sir William Dorrillon, did she know you were her father, every word you uttered, every look you glanced, would be received with gentleness and submission:—but your present rebukes from Mr. Mandred (as you are called), from a perfect stranger, as she supposes, she considers as an impertinence which she has a right to resent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I wish I had continued abroad. And yet, the hope of beholding her, and of bestowing upon her the riches I acquired, was my sole support through all the toils by which I gained them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>And, considering her present course of life, your riches could not come more opportunely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>She shall never have a farthing of them. Do you think I have encountered the perils of almost every climate, to squander my hard-earned fortune upon the paltry vicious pleasures in which she delights? No.—I have been now in your house exactly a month—I will stay but one day longer—and then, without telling her who I am, I will leave the kingdom and her for ever—Nor shall she know that this insignificant merchant whom she despises, was her father, till he is gone, never to be recalled.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>You are offended with some justice, but, as I have often told you, your excessive delicacy and respect for the conduct of the other sex, degenerate into rigour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>True—for what I see so near perfection as woman, I want to see perfect. <hi>We,</hi> Mr. Norberry, can never be perfect; but surely women, women, might easily be made angels!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>And if they were, we should soon be glad to make them into women again.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir William</speaker>
<stage>inattentive to Mr. Norberry.</stage>
<p>—She sets the example. <hi>She</hi> gives the fashion!—and now your Whole house, and all your visitors, in imitation of <hi>her,</hi> treat me with levity, or with contempt.—But I'll go away to-morrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Can you desert your child in the moment she wants your protection? That exquisite beauty just now become mature—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>There's my difficulty!—There's my struggle!—If she were not so like her mother, I could leave her without a pang—cast hey off, and think no more of her.—But that shape! that face! those speaking looks! Yet, how reversed!—Where is the diffidence, the humility—where is the simplicity of my beloved wife? Buried in her grave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>And, in all this great town, you may never see even its apparition.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I rejoice, however, at the stratagem by which I have gained a knowledge of her heart: deprived by the means of searching it in her early years, had I at present come as her father, she might have deceived me with counterfeit manners, till time disclosed the imposition.—Now at least, I am not imposed upon.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Servant.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Ser.</speaker>
<p>Lord Priory. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Lord Priory!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>An old acquaintance of mine, though we seldom meet. He has some singularities; and yet, perhaps—</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Lord Priory.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>My dear Lord, I am glad to see you. Mr. Mandred <stage>introducing Sir Willian.</stage> My Lord, I hope I see you in perfect health.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Yes: but in very ill humour. I came to London early this morning with my family for the winter, and found my house, after going through only a slight repair, so damp, that I dare not sleep in it: and so I am now sending and going all over the town to seek for lodgings.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Then seek no farther, but take up your lodgings here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>To be plain with you, I called in hopes you would ask me; for I am so delicately scrupulous in respect to lady Priory, that I could not bear the thought of taking her to an hotel.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Then pray return home, and bring her hither immediately, with all your luggage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I am most extremely obliged to you <stage>very fervently</stage>; for into no one house belonging to any of my acquaintance would I take my wife, so soon as into yours. I have now been married eleven years, and during all that time I have made it a rule never to go on a visit, so as to domesticate, in the house of a married man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>May I enquire the reason of that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>It is because I am married myself; and having always treated my wife according to the ancient mode of treating wives, I would rather she should never be an eye-witness to the modern household management.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>The ancients, I believe, were very affectionate to their wives.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>And they had reason to be so; for their wives obeyed them. The ancients seldom gave them the liberty to do wrong: but modern wives do as they like.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>And don't you suffer Lady Priory to do as she likes?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Yes, when it is what I like too. But never, never else.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Does not this draw upon you the character of an unkind husband?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>That I am proud of. Did you never observe, that seldom a breach of fidelity in a wise is exposed where the unfortunate husband is not said to be "the best creature in the world! Poor man, so good-natured!—Doatingly fond of his wife!—Indulged her in every thing!—How cruel in her to serve him so!" Now, if I am served <hi>so,</hi> it shall not be for my good-nature.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>But I hope you equally disapprove of every severity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p><stage>rapidly.</stage> What do you mean by severity?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>You know you used to be rather violent in your temper.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>So I am still—apt to be hasty and passionate
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
—but that is rather of advantage to me as a husband—it causes me to be obeyed without hesitation—no liberty for contention, tears, or repining. I insure conjugal sunshine, by now and then introducing a storm; while some husbands never see any thing but a cloudy sky, and all for the want of a little domestic thunder to clear away the vapours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I have long conceived indulgenee to be the bane of female happiness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>And so it is.—I know several women of fashion who will visit six place of different amusement on the same night, have company at home besides, and yet, for want of something more, they'll be out of spirits: my wife never goes to a public place, has scarce ever company at home, and yet is always in spirits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Never visits operas, or balls, or routs?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>How should she? She goes to bed every night exactly at ten.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>In the name of wonder, how have you been able to bring her to that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>By making her rise every morning at five.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>And so she becomes tired before night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Tired to death. Or, if I see her eyes completely open at bed-time, and she asks me to play one game more at piquet, the next morning I jog her elbow at half after four.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>But suppose she does not reply to the signal?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Then I turn the key of the door when I leave the chamber; and there I find her when I come home in the evening.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>And without her having seen a creature all day?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>This is in my favour; for not having seen a single soul, she is rejoiced even to see <hi>me.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>And will she speak to you after such usage?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>If you only considered how much a woman longs to speak after being kept a whole day silent, you would not ask that question.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Well! this is the most surprising method!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Not at all. In ancient days, when manners were simple and pure, did not wives wait at the table of their husbands? and did not angels witness the subordination? I have taught Lady Priory to practise the same humble docile obedience—to pay respect to her husband in every shape and every form, no careless inattention to <hi>me</hi>—no smiling politeness to others in preference to <hi>me</hi>——no putting <hi>me</hi> up in a corner—in all assemblies, she considers her husband as the first person.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I am impatient to see her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>But don't expect a fine lady with high feathers; and the <hi>et caetera</hi> of an Eastern concubine; you will see a modest plain English woman, with a cap on her head, a handkerchief on her neck, and a gown of our own manufacture.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>My friend Norberry, what a contrast must there be between Lady Priory and the ladies in this house!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p><stage>starting.</stage> Have you ladies in this house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Don't be alarmed; they are both single, and can give Lady Priory no ideas concerning the marriage state.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Are you sure of that? Some single women are more informed than their friends believe.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>For these ladies, notwithstanding a few (what <hi>you</hi> would call) excesses, I will answer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Well, then, I and my wife will be with you about nine in the evening; you know we go to-bed at ten.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>But remember you bring your own servants to wait on you at five in the morning.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I shall bring but one—my old servant Oliver, who knows all my customs so well, that I never go any where without him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>And is that old servant your valet still?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>No, he is now a kind of gentleman in waiting. I have had no employment for a valet
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>
since I married:—my wife, for want of dissipation, has not only time to attend upon herself, but upon me. Do you think I could suffer a clumsy man to tie on my neckcloth, or comb out my hair, when the soft, delicate, and tender hands of my wife are at my command?<stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>After this amiable description of a woman, how can I endure to see her, whom reasons bids me detest; but whom nature still—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Here she comes; and her companion in folly along with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>There's another woman! that Lady Mary Raffle? How can you suffer such people in your house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>She is only on a visit for a few months—she comes every winter, as her family and mine have long been intimately connected.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Let us go. Let us go. I can't bear the sight of them. <stage>Going.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Stay, and for <hi>once</hi> behave with politeness and good humour to your daughter—do—and I dare venture my life, she will neither insult nor treat you with disrespect. You know you always begin first.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Have not I a right to begin first?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>But that is a right of which she is ignorant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>And deserves to be so, and ever shall be so. <hi>I</hi> stay and treat her with politeness and good humour? No—rather let her kneel and implore my pardon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Suffer me to reveal who you are, and so she will.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>If you expose me only by the insinuation to her knowledge, our friendship is that moment at an end.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p><stage>Firmly.</stage> I have already given you my promise on that subject; and you may rely upon it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir. Wil.</speaker>
<p>I thank you—I believe you—and I thank you.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exeunt Sir</hi> William <hi>and Mr.</hi> Norberry.</stage>
<stage><pb n="8" facs="11"/><hi>Enter Lady</hi> Mary Raffle <hi>and Miss</hi> Dorrillon.</stage>

<p><stage><hi>Stealing on as Mr.</hi> Norberry <hi>and Sir</hi> William <hi>leave the stage.</hi></stage> They are gone. Thank heaven they are gone out of this room, for I expect a dozen visiters; and Mr. Norberry looks so gloomy upon me, he puts me out of spirits: while that Mandred's peevishness is not to be borne.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Be satisfied; for you were tolerably severe upon him this morning in your turn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Why, I am vext—and I, don't like to be found fault with in my best humour, much less when I have so many things to tease me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>What are they?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>I have now lost all my money, and all my jewels, at play; it is almost two years since I have received a single remittance from my father; and Mr. Norberry refuses to advance me a shilling more.—What I shall do to discharge a debt which must be paid either to-day or to-morrow, heaven knows!—Dear Lady Mary, you could lend me a small sum, could you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Who? I! <stage>with surprise</stage>—My dear creature, it was the very thing I was going to ask of you: for when you have money, I know no one so willing to disperse it among her friends.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Am not I?—I protest I love to part with my money; for I know with what pleasure I receive it myself, and I like to see that joy sparkle in another's eye, which has so often brightened my own. But last night ruined me—I must have money somewhere—As you can't assist me, I must ask Mr. Norberry for his carriage, and immediately go in search of some friend that can lend me four, or five, or six, or seven hundred pounds. But the worst is, I have lost my credit—Is not that dreadful?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, I know what it is. <stage>Shaking her head.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>What will become of me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Why don't you marry, and throw all misfortunes upon your husband?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Why don't <hi>you</hi> marry? For you have as many to throw.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>But not so many lovers who would be willing to receive the load. I have no Sir George Evelyn with ten thousand pounds a year—no Mr. Bronzely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>If you have not now, you once had; for I am sure Bronzely once paid his addresses to you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>And you have the vanity to suppose you took him from me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Silence.—Reserve your anger to defend, and not to attack me. We should be allies by the common ties of poverty: and 'tis time to arm; for here's the enemy.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Sir William <hi>with</hi> Mr. Norberry.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>They are here full. <stage><hi>Aside to Mr.</hi> Norberry, <hi>and offering to go back.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p><stage>Preventing him.</stage> No, no.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>I have been waiting here, Mr. Norberry, to ask a favour of you. <stage><hi>He and Sir</hi> William <hi>come forward.</hi></stage> Will you be so kind as to lend me your carriage for a couple of hours?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Mandred <stage><hi>pointing to Sir</hi> William</stage> asked me for it to take him into the city.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Mr. Mandred will give it up to Miss Dorrillon, I am sure: he can defer his business till to-morrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>No, Madam, she may as well put off hers. I have money to receive, and I can't do it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>I have money to pay, and I can't do it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>If one is going to receive, and the other to pay money, I think the best way is for you to go together; and then, what deficiency there is on one side, the other may supply.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Will you consent, Mr. Mandred?—Come, do; and I'll be friends with you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>"She'll be friends with me!"</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Will you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="10" facs="13"/>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Well, I certainly can ask a favour of Mr. Mandred better than I can of any person in the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Why so, Maria?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Because, instead of pain, I can see it gives him pleasure to refuse me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I never confer a favour, of the most trivial kind, where I have no esteem.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p><stage>proudly.</stage> Nor would I receive a favour, of the most trivial kind, from one who has not liberality to esteem me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Come, Miss Dorrillon, do not grow serious; laugh as much as you please, but say nothing that—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>To her impatiently.</stage> From whom then can you ever receive favours, except from the vain, the idle, and the depraved?—from those whose lives are passed in begging them of others?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>They are the persons who know best how to be on them: for my part, had I not sometimes felt what it was to want a friend, I might never have had humanity to be the friend of another.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Servant.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Ser.</speaker>
<p>Sir George Evelyn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>And pray, my dear, whose friend have you ever been?— <stage><hi>Enter</hi> Sir George Evelyn.</stage>—Not Sir George Evelyn's, I am sure; and yet he of all others deserves your friendship most.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>But friendship will not content him: as soon as he thought he had gained that.—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>He aspired to the supreme happiness of your love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Now you talk of "supreme happiness," have you provided tickets for the fête on Thursday?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>I have: provided you have obtained Mr. Norberry's leave to go.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>That I cannot grant.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Nay, my dear Sir, do not force me to go without it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>Recollecting himself.</stage> I was only going to say, that if you did, and I were Mr. Norberry—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>And if you <hi>were</hi> Mr. Norberry, and treated me in the manner you now do, depend upon it I should not think your approbation or disapprobation, your pleasure or displeasure, of the slightest consequence.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>greatly agitated.</stage> I dare say not—I dare say not. Good morning, Sir George—I dare say not.—Good morning, Mr. Norberry. <stage>Going.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Stop a moment.—Maria, you have offended Mr. Mandred.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>He has offended me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>at the door going off.</stage> I shan't offend you long.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Norberry</speaker>
<p><stage>going to him and taking him by the arm.</stage> Stay, Mr. Mandred; Miss Dorrillon, make an apology: Mr. Mandred is my friend, and you must not treat him with this levity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>No, no apology.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>No, no apology. But I'll tell you what I'll do. <stage>Goes up to Sir William</stage>——If Mr. Mandred likes, I'll shake hands with him—and we'll be good friends for the future. But then don't find fault with me—I can't bear it. You don't like to be found fault with yourself—You look as cross as any thing every time I say the least word against you. Come, shake hands; and don't let us see one another's failings for the future.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>There is no future for the trial.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>How do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Mandred sets off again for India to-morrow.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Indeed! I thought he was come to live in England! I am sorry you are going.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>with earnestness.</stage> Why sorry?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Because we have so frequently quarrelled. I am always unhappy when I am going to be parted from a person with whom I have disagreed;
<pb n="12" facs="15"/>
I often think I could part with less regret from a friend.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir G.</speaker>
<p>Not, I suppose, if the quarrel is forgiven?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Ah! but Mr. Mandred does not forgive! no! in his looks I can always see resentment.—Sometimes indeed I have traced a spark of kindness, and have gently tried to blow it to a little flame of friendship, when, with one hasty puff I have put it out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>You are right. It is—I believe—extinguished.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit; Mr.</hi> Norberry <hi>following.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>A very singular man.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Oh! If he was not rich, there would be no bearing him—Indeed he seems to have lost all his friends; for during the month he has been here, I never found he had any one acquaintance out of this house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>And what is very strange, he has taken an aversion to me.—But it is still more strange, that although I know he has, yet in my heart I like <hi>him.</hi> He is morose to an insufferable degree; but then, when by chance he speaks kind, you cannot imagine how it soothes me.—He wants compassion and all the tender virtues; and yet, I frequently think, that if any serious misfortune were to befall me, he would be the first person to whom I should fly to complain.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Then why don't you fly and tell him of your misfortune last night.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p><stage>starting.</stage> What misfortune?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p><stage>to lady Mary.</stage> Hush!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>A loss at play— <stage>To Miss Dor.</stage>—I beg your pardon, but it was out before you said hush.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Ah! Maria, will you still risk your own and my happiness?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Your happiness and mine, Sir!—I beg you will not place them so near to each other.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Mine is so firmly fixed on you, it can only exist in yours.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="13" facs="16"/>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Then, when she is married to Mr. Bronzely, you will be happy because she will be so?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Bronzely! has he dared?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Have not <hi>you</hi> dared, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>But I believe Mr. Bronzely is the most daring of the two— <stage>aside to Sir Geo</stage>—take care of him. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Miss Dorrillon, I will not affront you by supposing that you mean seriously to receive the addresses of Mr. Bronzely; but I warn you against giving others, who know you less than I do, occasion to think so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>I never wish to deceive any one—I do admit of Mr. Bronzely's addresses.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Why, he is the professed lover of your friend Lady Mary! or granting he denies it, and that I even pass over the frivolity of the coxcomb, still he is unworthy of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>He says the same of you; and half a dozen more say exactly the same of each other. If you like, I'll discard every one of you as unworthy; but if I retain you, I will retain the rest. Which do you choose?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>I submit to any thing rather than the total loss of you—But remember, that your felicity—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>"Felicity! felicity!"—ah! that is a word not to be found in the vocabulary of my sensations!— <stage>sighing.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>I believe you, and have always regarded you with a compassion that has augmented my love. In your infancy deprived of the watchful eye and anxious tenderness of a mother; the manly caution and authority of a father: misled by the brilliant vapour of fashion; surrounded by enemies in the garb of friends—Ah! do you weep? blessed, blessed be the sign!—Suffer me to dry those tears I have caused, and to give you a knowledge of true felicity.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p><stage>recovering.</stage> I am very angry with myself.—Don't, I beg, tell Mr. Norberry or Mr. Mandred you saw me cry—they'll suppose I have

been move indiscreet <stage>stifling her tears</stage> than I really have. For in reality I have nothing—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Do not endeavour to conceal from me, what my tender concern for you has given me the means to become acquainted with. I know you are plunged in difficulties by your father neither sending nor coming, as you once expected: I know you are still deeper plunged by your fondness for play.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Very well, Sir! proceed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Thus, then—Suffer me to send my steward to you this morning; he shall regulate your accounts, and place them in a state that shall protect you from further embarrassment till your father sends to you; or protect you from his reproaches, should he arrive.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Sir George, I have listened to your detail of vices, which I acknowledge, with patience, with humility—but your suspicion of those which I have <hi>not,</hi> I treat with pride, with indignation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>How! suspicion!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>What part of my conduct, Sir, has made you dare to suppose I would extricate myself from the difficulties that surround me, by the influence I hold over the weakness of a lover?</p>

Counsellor for defendant—Because, moreover, and besides <hi>B</hi> who has a claim on defendant's heart, there are also <hi>C, D, E, F,</hi> and <hi>G</hi>; all of whom put in their separate claims—and what in this case can poor <hi>A</hi> do? She is willing to part and divide her love, share and share alike; but <hi>B</hi> will have all or none: so poor <hi>A</hi> must remain <hi>A</hi> by herself <hi>A.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Do you think I would accept a share of your heart?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Do you think I could afford to give it you all? "Besides," says defendant's counsellor, I will prove that plaintiff <hi>B</hi> has no heart to give defendant in return—he has, indeed a pulsation on the left side; but as it never beat with any thing but suspicion and jealousy; in the laws of love, it is not termed, admitted, or considered a heart.<stage>Going.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>To the music-room, to be sure: and if you follow me, it shall be to see me treat every person there better than yourself—and Mr. Bronzely, whom you hate, to see me treat him best of all. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>I must follow you though to death. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Fool! And yet am I nearly as weak as he is? Else why do I linger in this house? Why feed my hopes with some propitious moment to waken her to repentance? Why still anxiously wish to ward off some dreaded fate?—If we would marry Sir George, now—if she would give me only <hi>one</hi> proof of discretion, I think I would endeavour to take her to my heart.</p>
</sp>
<stage><pb n="20" facs="25"/><hi>Enter Mr.</hi> Bronzely, <hi>in great haste.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>My dear Sir, will you do me the greatest favour in the world?—you must do it in an instant too. Do, my dear Sir, ask no question; but lend me your coat for a single moment, and take mine—only for a moment—I cannot explain my reasons, now, my impatience is so great;—but, the instant you have complied, I will inform you of the whole secret; and you will for ever rejoice that you granted my request. <stage>Pulling off his coat.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>aside, with great scorn.</stage> And this very contemptible fellow is the favoured lover of my daughter!—I'll— <stage>after a struggle</stage>—yes—I'll make myself master of his secret—it may possibly concern her—my child—my child's safety may depend upon it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Dear Mr. Mandred, no time is to be lost!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>This is rather a strange request, Mr. Bronzely. However, your fervency convinces me you must have some very forcible reason.—There's my coat, Sir, <stage>Gives it him.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Thank you, dear Sir,—a thousand times.—This goodness I shall ever remember—this binds me to you for ever!— <stage>putting it on.</stage> Thank you, Sir, a thousand times!<stage>Bowing dressed and composed.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>after putting on the other coat.</stage> And now. Sir, explain the cause of this metamorphosis—let me have the satisfaction to know what advantage will accrue from it; and in what I have to rejoice.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Will you promise me not to reveal the secret, if I trust you with it?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Would you add conditions after the bargain is made? I must know your secret instantly.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Threatening.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Then I will disclose it to you voluntarily; and rely on your honour to keep it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>attentively.</stage> Well, Sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Hark! I thought I heard somebody coming!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Offers to go.</stage>
<sp>
<pb n="21" facs="26"/>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I insist upon the information. <stage>Laying hold of him</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Well, then Sir—well—you shall—you shall.—Then, Sir—in the small gallery, which separates the music-room from the rest of these apartments—in that little gallery, the lamp is just unfortunately, gone out.—I was (as unfortunately) coming along, when the whisking of a woman's gown made me give a sudden start!—I found a person was in the gallery with me, and in the dark.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>And so, confidently assuring myself, that it was Miss Dorrillon's waiting-maid, or Lady Mary's waiting-maid, I most unluckily clasped my arms around her, and took one kiss.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Only one?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>There might be half a dozen! I won't pretend to swear to one. We'll say half a dozen, before I knew who she was. My rapidity would not let her breathe at first, and she was fairly speechless.—But the moment she recovered her breath, she cry'd, "Villian! whoever you are, you shall repent this:"—I found it was the voice of a lady to whom I had just been introduced in the concert-room, one Lady Priory! It seems she was stealing to bed at the tune we unhappily met.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>But what has this to do with your coat?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>A great deal, Sir—you will find a great deal.—As I perceived she did not know me, I carefully held my tongue—but she with her prudish notions, called "Help, and murder!" On which I flew to the door, to get away before the lights could be brought—she slew after me: and, as I went out, exclaimed, Don't hope to conceal yourself; I shall know you among the whole concert-room; for I carry scissors hanging at my side, and I have cut a piece off your coat. <stage><hi>Sir</hi> William <hi>looks hastily at his coal—on which</hi> Bronzely <hi>holds up the part cut.</hi></stage>—And, sure enough, so she had!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>in anger</stage> And what, Sir, am I to have the disgrace——</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="22" facs="27"/>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Either you or I must.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>And do you dare—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Consider, my dear Sir, how much less the fault is, if perpetrated by you, than by me! This is the first offence of the kind which, I dare say, you have committed this many a year; and it will be overlooked in <hi>you.</hi> But I have been suspected of two or three things of the same sort within a very short time; and I should never be forgiven.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Nor ought you to be forgiven—It would be scandalous in me to connive—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>But would it not be more scandalous to reveal the secret of a person who confided in you?—who flew to you in distress, as his friend, the partner of his cares?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Your impertinence to me, but more your offence to a woman of virtue, deserves punishment. Yet I think the punishment of death, in the way that a man of my Lord Priory's temper might inflict it, much too honourable for you deserts; so I save your life for some less creditable end. I lend you my coat, to disgrace you by existence; and will go to my chamber, and put on another myself. <stage><hi>Passes</hi> Bronzely, <hi>in order to retire to his chamber.</hi></stage></p>

<p><stage>affecting surprise.</stage> Indeed!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p><stage>trembling with rage.</stage> I am at a loss how to act. <stage><hi>Draws a chair with violence, and places himself down by Sir</hi> William—<hi>Sir</hi> William <hi>appears disconcerted and uneasy.</hi></stage> But if I could find the man to whom this piece of cloth belongs—</p>

<sp>
<pb n="23" facs="28"/>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>What! this small piece of woollen cloth?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Yes, then I should know how to act. In the mean time, Mr. Mandred, as I know you are a great admirer of my wife <stage>Sir William <hi>starts</hi></stage>, and a grave prudent man of honour, I come to ask your advice, how I am the most likely to find out the villain who has dared to insult her; for a gross insult she has received from one of Mr. Norberry's visitor's wearing a coat of which this is a part.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>The villain, no doubt, stole out of the house immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I ordered the street door to be guarded that instant—and you Mr. Bronzely, are now the last man whose habit I have examined.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>And you see I am perfectly whole. <stage>Turning round.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I do see—I do see. <stage><hi>Sir</hi> William <hi>moves about on his chair, and appears greatly embarrassed. Lord</hi> Priory <hi>starts up in a violent passion—Sir</hi> William <hi>starts up with him.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I'll find him out if he is on earth—I'll find him out if—My passion carries me away—I have not coolness to detect him myself—I'll employ another—I'll send Oliver in search. Oliver! <stage>calling</stage> Oliver! here Oliver! Why don't you answer when you are called, you stupid, dull, idle, forgetful, blundering, obstinate, careless, self-sufficient.— <stage>Exit in a fury.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>rising with great dignity</stage> And now, Mr. Bronzely, how do you think you are to repay me, for having felt one transitory moment of shame? Understand, Sir, that shame is one of the misfortunes to which I have never—</p>

</sp>
<stage><hi>Sir</hi> William <hi>reluctantly retires to his chair.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Well, I do most cordially rejoice, when peevish, suspicious, and censorious people, meet with humiliation! I could die with laughing at the
<pb n="24" facs="29"/>
incident which has put both my Lord and my Lady Priory in the greatest terror, grief, and rage.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>rising.</stage> I am out of all patience. The malicious depravity of persons in a certain sphere of life is not to be borne. <stage>With firmness and solemnity.</stage> Lady Mary—Mr. Bronzely—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p><stage>in a half whisper to him.</stage> Go away—don't expose yourself—steal out the room—take my advice, and go to-bed—hide yourself. So great is my respect for you, I would not have you detected for the world.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I am going to retire, Sir. I would not throw my friend's house into confusion and broils; therefore I am as well pleased not to be detected as you can be. <stage>Goes to the door, then turns.</stage> But before I quit the room, I am irresistibly impelled to say—Mr. Bronzely! Lady Mary! while you continue to ridicule all that is virtuous, estimable, dignified, your vices most assuredly will plunge you into that very disgrace—</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Did not I entreat you to go to bed?</p>

<p>Oh! this is the highest gratification I ever knew. My Lord! my Lord. <stage>calling.</stage></p>

<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Hush, hush?—hold, for heavens sake.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>But mercy and goodness defend us! who would have thought of this grave gentleman? Ha, ha, ha!—I can tell you what, Sir; my Lord will be in a terrible passion with you. This house won't hold you both; and I am sure I hate to make mischief.—Mum—I'll say nothing about it. <stage><hi>clapping</hi> Sir William <hi>on the shoulder</hi></stage> And so make yourself easy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p><stage><hi>on the other side of</hi> Sir William.</stage> Yes, make yourself easy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>A good servant should sometimes be a peacemaker—for my part, I have faults of my own,
<pb n="25" facs="30"/>
and so, I dare say, has that gentlewoman. But of ail the birds in the wood, how came you to make up to my Lady? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>No jests—no jests. Mr. Mandred is my friend—my very good friend—and he is not so much to blame as you think, for—Good night, my dear Sir. Heaven bless you. I thank you a thousand times. Good night. <stage><hi>Shaking hands with</hi> Sir William, <hi>and leading him towards the door.</hi></stage></p>

<p>Why, he never so much as once said he was obliged to me.</p>

<p>I am sure, if you do not discover this to your master, I will.</p>
</sp>

<p>Oh! as that old gentleman had not manner to say "thank you for your kindness," I'll go tell my Lord directly. <stage>Exit</stage></p>

<p><stage>running after him</stage> No, no, no—stop Oliver. He is gone!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>What makes you thus anxious and concerned, Bronzely? Now, I wish I may suffer death, if, till I came into this room, I did not think <hi>you</hi> were the offender.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>I! I indeed!—No, if I could have been tempted to offend any woman in this house in a similar manner, it could have been none but you.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Bowing.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>No, Bronzely, no; I have been too partial to you, to have any remaining claims.—Hark! don't I hear Lord Priory's voice in a dreadful rage?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Then Oliver has accused him. What shall I do to prevent mischief? Dear Lady Mary, as it is not proper for me to stay here any longer uninvited, do you run and try to pacify my Lord Priory. Tell him Mandred does not sleep here to-night; and in the morning you are sure he will make an apology.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>I will do as you desire—but I know Mr. Mandred so well, that I am sure he will not.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<pb n="26" facs="31"/>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Then I will for him. Early in the morning, I'll wait on Lady Priory, and beg pardon in his name without his knowing it. Yes, I have got poor Mandred into a difficulty, and it is my duty to get him out of it. And then I shall not only serve him, but have one interview more with that heavenly woman. <stage>Exit.</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Lady Priory, I am come—I am come upon rather an aukward, yet a very serious business; it was my misfortune to be among that company yesterday evening, where an unworthy member of it had the insolence to offer an affront to your resplendent virtue—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="27" facs="32"/>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>——I have some household accounts to arrange, and breakfast to make for my Lord as soon as he leaves his chamber: therefore, if you please, Sir, proceed to the business on which you came, without thinking it necessary to interrupt it by any compliment to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>I will be concise, Madam.—In a word, I wait upon you from Mr. Mandred, with the most humble apology for his late conduct, which he acknowledges to have been indecorous and unwarrantable; but he trusts, that in consequence of the concession which I now make for him, the whole matter will, from this hour, be buried in oblivion.</p>

<p>I don't believe a word of the story; yet, as a received opinion, it is a charming weapon for an enemy, and I long to use it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Not now, not now—because I have some business with him, and 'twill put him out of temper. <stage>He hands her to the door.</stage><stage><hi>Exit Miss</hi> Dorrillon.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>looking stedfastly after her.</stage> Poor girl! poor girl! I am not yet sufficiently enraged against her, not to compassionate her for her choice!—Is
<pb n="30" facs="35"/>
this the man who is to be, for life, her companion, her protector?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Well, Mr. Mandred, I believe I have settled it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Settled what <stage>anxiously.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>At least I have done all in my power to serve you: perhaps you don't know that Mr. Oliver divulged the whole affair. But I have waited on my Lady Priory, and I do believe I have settled it with her, to manage it so with my Lord, that every thing shall be hushed up. You may expect a few jests among your female acquaintance, and a few epigrams in the news-papers; but I verily believe every thing material is safe.—Is there any farther satisfaction which you demand from me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Not at present—a man is easily satisfied who possesses both courage and strength to do himself right, whenever he feels his wrongs oppressive. I have as yet found but little inconvenience from the liberties you have taken with me; and what, just at this time far more engages my attention than revenge, is, an application to you for intelligence. Without farther preface, do you pay your addresses to the young lady who lives in this house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Yes I do, Sir—I do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>You know, I suppose, which of the two ladies I mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Which ever you mean, Sir, 'tis all the same, for I pay my addresses to them both.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
<p><stage>starting.</stage> To them both!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>I always do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>And pray, which of them do you love?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Both, Sir——upon my word, both—I assure you, both.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>But you don't intend to marry both?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>I don't intend to marry either: and indeed, the woman whom I love best in the world, has a husband already. Do you suppose I could confine my affections to Lady Mary or Miss Dorrillon, after Lady Priory appeared? do you suppose I did not know who it was I met last night in the dark? wherever I visit, Mr. Mandred, I always make love
<pb n="31" facs="36"/>
to every woman in the house: and I assure you they all expect it—I assure you, Sir, they all expect it.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Sir</hi> William <hi>walks about in anger.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Have you any further commands for me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Yes, one word more.—And you really have no regard for this girl who parted from you as I came in?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Oh yes, pardon me—I admire, I adore, I love her to distraction: and if I had not been so long acquainted with my Lady Mary, nor had seen my Lady Priory last night, I should certainly call Sir George Evelyn to an account for being so perpetually with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>anxiously.</stage> Do you think he loves her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I dare say, as well as I do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Do you think she likes him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>I think she likes <hi>me.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>But, with your method of affection, she may like him too.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>She may, she may.—In short, there is no answering for what <hi>she</hi> likes—all whim and flightiness—acquainted with every body—coquetting with every body—and in debt with every body. Her mind distracted between the claims of lovers, and the claims of creditors,—the anger of Mr. Norberry, and the want of intelligence from he father!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>She is in a hopeful way.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Oh, it would be impossible to think of marrying her in her present state—for my part, I can't—and I question whether Sir George would.—But if her father comes home, and gives her the fortune that was once expected, why then I may possibly marry her myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>firmly.</stage> She will never have any fortune—I come from India lately, you know; and you may take my word her father is not coming over, nor will he ever come.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Are you sure of that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Very sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Then keep it a secret—don't tell her so
<pb n="32" facs="37"/>
—poor thing! it would break her heart. She is doatingly fond of her father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Hah! how!—oh no, she can have no remembrance of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Not of his person, perhaps: but he has constantly corresponded with her; sent her presents, and affectionate letters—and you know a woman's heart is easily impressed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I never heard her mention her father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Not to you—but to us who are kind to her, she talks of him continually. She cried bitterly the other day when the last ship came in, and there was no account of him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Did she? did she? <stage>eagerly.</stage> Aye, I suppose she is alarmed lest he should be dead, and all his fortune lost.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>No, I believe her affection for <hi>him</hi> is totally unconnected with any interested views. I have watched her upon that head, and I believe she loves her father sincerely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>wiping a tear from his eye.</stage> I believe it does not matter whom she loves!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>By the bye, she hates <hi>you.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I thought so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you may be satisfied of that. Yes, she even quarrelled with me the other day for speaking in your favour: you had put her in a passion, and she said no one that loved her, ought to have any respect for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I am much obliged to her—very much obliged to her. Did she say nothing more?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Only that you were ill-natured, dogmatic, cruel and insolent. Nothing more.—And say what she will against you, you know you can be even with her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I <hi>can</hi> be even with her, and I <hi>will</hi> be even with her.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Lord</hi> Priory, <hi>and takes</hi> Bronzely <hi>on one side</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I have accepted this man's apology:—I will not call him to a serious account; but he shall not escape every kind of resentment.—I am resolved
<pb n="33" facs="38"/>
to laugh at him; to turn the whole affair into mirth and good humour; at the same time to gall him to the heart. Good morning, Mr. Mandred?—Let me go, <stage><hi>violently to</hi> Bronzely</stage> I must joke with him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>But neither your voice nor your looks agree with your words.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Mandred, I did intend to be angry—but it would give too respectable an air to a base act on—and so I am come to laugh at you. <stage><hi>Enter</hi> Lady Mary.</stage> And I am sure Lady Mary, will join even me, in laughing at this man of gallantry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M,</speaker>
<p>Oh! I am absolutely afraid to come near the Tarquin!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>You need <hi>not,</hi> Lady Mary; for there can be no Tarquin without a Lucretia.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>However, Mr. Mandred, it is proper I should tell you, I accept the apology you have made: but at the same time—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>hastily</stage> What do you mean, my Lord? I have made no apology.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, you have—I called and made one for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Made an apology for me! You have just gone one step too far then I insist—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p><stage><hi>Drawing Sir</hi> William <hi>on one side.</hi></stage> I will—I will—I will set every thing to rights.

It was I (pray believe me, I beg you will; don't doubt my word), it was I who committed the offence of which my friend, the man I
<pb n="34" facs="39"/>
respect and reverence, stands accused—It was I who offended my Lady Priory, and then—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>It can't be——I won't believe you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>I am at a loss which to admire most, the warmth of Mr. Bronzely's friendship, or the coldness of Mr. Mandred's gratitude!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Oh! if it were not for that happy steadiness of feature, he could not preach rectitude of conduct as he does.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Have a care—don't proceed—stop where you are—dare not <hi>you</hi> complete a sentence that is meant to mock me.—I have borne the impertinence of this whole company with patience, with contempt; but dare <hi>you</hi> to breathe an accent suspicious of my conduct, and I will instantly teach you how to respect <hi>me,</hi> and to shrink with horror from yourself. <stage>She stands motionless in surprise.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>What a passion he is in! Compose yourself, Mr. Mandred.</p>

<p>I protest, Mr. Mandred—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>Raising his voice.</stage> Dare not to address yourself to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Did you ever hear the like?—And I vow she looks awed by him!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>How strange, that a man can't command his temper!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Mandred, permit me to say, I have ever wished to treat you with respect—nor would
<pb n="35" facs="40"/>
I be rash in laying that wish aside.—Yet, I must now take upon me to assure you, that if you think to offend every lady in this house with impunity, you are mistaken.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Sir George, if you mean to frighten me by your threats, I laugh at you—but if your warmth is really kindled, and by an attachment to that unworthy object, <stage><hi>pointing to Miss</hi> Dorrillon</stage> I only pity you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Insufferable!— <stage>going up to him.</stage>—Instantly make an atonement for what you have said, or expect the consequence!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>And pray, Sir George, what atonement does your justice demand?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Retract your words—Acknowledge you were grossly deceived, when you said Miss Dorrillon was unworthy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Retract my words!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Were they not unjust?—Is it a reproach, that, enveloped in the maze of fashionable life, she has yet preserved her virtue unsuspected? That, encumbered with the expences consequent to her connections, she has proudly disdained even from me the honourable offer of pecuniary aid? that her fond hope still fixes on the return of an absent parent, whose blessing she impatiently expects? and that I should have watched her whole conduct with an eye of scrutinizing jealousy, and yet have only beheld that which makes me aspire, as the summit of earthly happiness to become her husband?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Young man, I admire your warmth <stage>with great fervour and affection</stage> There is much compassion, and benevolence, and charity, in sometimes mistaking the vicious for the virtuous; and if in the heat of contention I have said a word reflecting on your character, I am ready to avow my error, and before this company to beg your pardon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>That is not enough, Sir— <stage><hi>taking</hi> Miss Dorrillon <hi>by the hand and leading her forward</hi></stage>—you must ask this lady's pardon.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Sir</hi> William <hi>starts and turns his face away, strongly impressed.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<pb n="36" facs="41"/>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Ask <hi>her</hi> pardon! Though I forgive some insults, I will not this.—Ask <hi>her</hi> pardon?—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, Sir George, you have no business with Mr. Mandred's quarrels and mine—Reserve your heroic courage for some nobler purpose than a poor woman's reputation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Point out a nobler, and I'll give up this.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>There is none so noble! And I wish, Sir George, you would undertake to vindicate mine.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Come, Lady Mary, let us retire, and leave these two irritable men to themselves.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Come Maria, let us leave them alone. He'll teach Mr. Mandred to be civil for the future.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p><stage>in great agitation.</stage> Dear madam, I would not leave them alone for the world!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Then, my Lord, you and I will; they have no offensive weapons; so we may venture to leave them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>This comes of being too warm in conversation! This comes of being in a passion!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exeunt Lord</hi> Priory <hi>and Lady Mary.</hi></stage>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p><stage>catching hold of him.</stage> For once I give up my pride to soften yours, Come do not look thus determined!—I am sure Mr. Mandred did not mean to offend me; the words he made use of fell from his lips by accident.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>They did not—I meant them—I mean them still—and I repeat them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p><stage><hi>to</hi> Sir William.</stage> Now, how can you be so provoking?—Nay, hold, Sir George, <stage>he offers to go</stage> you shall not go away with that frowning brow. <stage><hi>She draws him gently towards Sir</hi> William, <hi>then takes Sir</hi> William<hi>'s hand.</hi></stage> Nor you, with yours.—Come, shake hands for my sake.—Now, as I live Sir George, Mr. Mandred's hand feels warmer and kinder than yours—he tries to draw it back, but he has not the heart. <stage><hi>Sir</hi> William <hi>snatches it away as by compulsion.</hi></stage>—Thou art a strange personage!—thou wilt not suffer me either to praise or dispraise thee.—Come, Sir George,
<pb n="37" facs="42"/>
make up this difference—for if you were to fight and Mr. Mandred was to fall—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>What then?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Why, "I could better spare a better man."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>How!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>I see you are both sullen, both obstinate, and I have but one resource.—Sir George, if you aspire to my hand, dare not to lift your's against Mr. Mandred. He and I profess to be enemies; but if I may judge of his feelings by my own, we have but passing enmities.—I bear him no malice, nor he me, I dare be sworn. Therefore, Sir, lift but your arm against him, or insult him with another word, and our intercourse is for ever at an end.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<stage>Sir George <hi>and</hi> Sir William <hi>stand for some time silent.</hi></stage>

<p>The secret!—yes, Sir—The secret which I was going to disclose to my Lady Priory—
<pb n="39" facs="44"/>
Ha, Ha, ha!—But, my Lord, I am afraid it is of too frivolous a nature for your attention.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I account nothing frivolous which concerns my wife.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, my Lord, certainly not.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Besides; she told me it was of the utmost importance. Did not you?<stage>angrily.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>He said so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>And so it was—it was of importance <hi>then</hi>—just at the very time I was speaking to Lady Priory on the subject.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>You said so but this very moment.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Come, come, tell it immediately, whatever it is. Come, let us hear it.— <stage>after waiting some time</stage> Why, Sir, you look as if you were ashamed of it! What can be the meaning of this?</p>

<p>To be plain, my Lord, my secret will disclose the folly of a person for whom I have a sincere regard.</p>

<p>No matter—let every fool look like a fool, and every villain be known for what he is—Tell your story.</p>

<p>How can you deprive me of the pleasure you promised? You said it would prevent every future care.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Explain, Sir. I begin to feel myself not quite so composed as I expected. You never, perhaps, saw me in a passion—she has—and if you were once to see me really angry—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Then, my Lord, I am apt to be passionate too—and I boldly tell you, that what I had to reveal, though perfectly proper, was meant for Lady Priory alone to hear.

<p>Upon my honour, during our whole conversation upon that subject, you never named my Lord Priory's name.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>How, Mr. Bronzely, did you suppose she and I were two? Perhaps you did, and that we wanted a third. Well, I quite forgive you for your silly mistake, and laugh at you, ha, ha, ha! as I did at Mandred.— <stage>seriously</stage>—Did you suppose, Sir, we lived like persons of fashion of the modern time? Did you imagine that a woman of her character could have a wish, a desire, even a thought, a secret from her husband?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>It is amazing to find so much fidelity the reward of tyranny!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>Sir—I speak with humility—I would not wish to give offence— <stage>timidly</stage>—But to the best of my observation and understanding, your sex, in respect to us, are <hi>all tyrants.</hi> I was born to be the slave of some of you—I make the choice to obey my husband.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Mr. Bronzely; and I believe it is more for her happiness to be my slave, than your friend—to live in fear of me, than in love with you—Lady Priory, leave the room.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit</hi> Lady Priory.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Do you see—Did you observe the glow of truth and candour which testifies that woman's faith? and do you not blush at having attempted it? Call me a tyrant! Where are the signs? Oh, if every married man would follow my system in the management of his wife, every impertinent lover would look just as foolish as you!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>This is all boasting, my Lord—you live in continual fear—for (without meaning any offence to Lady Priory's honour) you know you dare not trust her for one hour alone with any man under sixty.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I dare trust her at any time with a coxcomb</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>That is declaring I am not one—for I am certain you dare not trust her alone with me.</p>
</sp>

<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p><stage>in a passion.</stage> Yes, with fifty such.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>But not with one—you are right—it might be dangerous.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p><stage>angrily.</stage> No, it would not.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p><stage>significantly.</stage> Yes, it would.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Have not you had a trial?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>But you were present. You constantly follow all her steps, watch all she says and does. But I believe you are right—wives are not to be trusted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Mine is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>No, my dear Lord Priory, you must first become gentle, before you can positively confide in her affection—before you can trust her in a house, or in any place, alone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p><stage>hastily.</stage> To prove you are mistaken, I'll instantly go back to my friend Norberry's, and leave you here to tell her the secret you boasted. Pay your addresses to her, if that is the secret—You have my free consent.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>My dear friend, I'll accept it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Ay, I see you have hopes of supplanting me, by calling me your friend.—But can you conceive now that she'll Men to you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>You have given me leave to try, and can't recall it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>But depend upon it, you will meet with some terrible humiliation.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Either you or I shall.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I shall laugh to hear you tumbled down stairs.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>You are not to remain on the watch here; you are to return to Mr. Norberry's.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Was that the bargain?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Don't you remember? you said so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Well, if that will give you any satisfaction—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>—It will give me great satisfaction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Heaven forgive me, but your confidence makes me laugh. Ha, ha, ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>And yours makes me laugh. Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>I know it, my Lord. I thought nevertheless I might be wanted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>And so you are, good Mr. Oliver.

<p>I hate the fashion—and were I not sure you would now be received in a very unfashionable manner—</p>

<p>No rough dealings, I hope?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you begin to be afraid do you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>No——but I have met with an accident or two lately—and I am not so well acquainted with ancient usages as to know in what manner a man of my pursuits would have been treated in former times.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>A man of your pursuits, Mr. Bronzely, is of a very late date; and to be shamed out of them by a wife like mine.</p>

<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>And here is the end of my voyage to England!—a voyage, which, for years, my mind has dwelt on with delight!—I pictured to myself my daughter grown to womanhood, beautiful! and so she is.—Accomplished! and so she is.—Virtuous! and so she is.—Am I of a discontented nature then, that I am not satisfied?—Am I too nice?—Perhaps I am.—Soothing thought!—I will for a moment cherish it, and dwell with some little gratitude upon her late anxiety for my safety. <stage>He walks about in a thoughtful musing manner.</stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>What did you want, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="45" facs="50"/>
<speaker>Nab.</speaker>
<p>A lady, that I have just this minute made my prisoner; but she ran from me, and locked herself in here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>with surprise</stage> Arrested a lady!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nab.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Sir; and if you mean to deny her being here, I must make bold to search the room.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Let me look at your credentials.— <stage>takes the writ.</stage>—"Elizabeth Dorrillon for six hundred pounds." Pray, Sir, is it customary to have female names on pieces of paper of this denomination?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nab.</speaker>
<p>Oh yes, Sir, very customary. There are as many ladies who will run into tradesmen's books, as there are gentlemen; and when one goes to take the ladies, they are a thousand times more slippery to catch than the men.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Abominable?—Well Sir, your present prisoner shall not slip through your hands, if I can prevent it. I scorn to defend a worthless woman, as much as I should glory in preserving a good one: and I give myself joy in being the instrument of your executing justice.— <stage><hi>He goes and leads Miss</hi> Dorrillon <hi>from the place where she was concealed—she casts down her head.</hi></stage>—What! do you droop? Do you tremble? You, who at the ball to-night would have danced lightly, though your poor creditor had been perishing with want! You, who never asked yourself if your extravagance might not send an industrious father of a family to prison, can you feel on the prospect of going thither yourself?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>For what cause am I the object of your perpetual persecution?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nab.</speaker>
<p>Lor! Madam, the gentleman means to bail you after all: I can see it by his looks.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>How, rascal, dare you suppose, of imagine, or hint, such a thing?<stage>going up to him in anger.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor</speaker>
<p>That's right, beat him out of the house.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>No, Madam, he shall not go out of the house without taking you along with him. Punishment may effect in your disposition what indulgence has no hope of producing.—There is your prisoner <stage>handing her over to him</stage>—and you may take my word, that she will not be released by me, or by any
<pb n="46" facs="51"/>
one: and it will be only adding to a debt she can never pay, to take her to any place previous to a prison. <stage>with emotion of resentment, yet deep sorrow.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Nab.</speaker>
<p>Is that true, my Lady?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p><stage>after a pause.</stage> Very true, I have but one friend—but one relation in the world—and he is far away. <stage>weeps.</stage><stage><hi>Sir</hi> William <hi>wipes his eyes.</hi></stage></p>

<sp>
<speaker>Nab.</speaker>
<p>More's the pity.</p>

<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>No, Sir, no—no pity at all—for if fewer fine ladies had friends, we should have fewer examples of profligacy. <stage><hi>She walks to the door, then turns to Sir</hi> William.</stage></p>

<p>Mr. Mandred, Mr. Mandred. <stage>He turns.</stage> Sir—Mr. Mandred—Sir,— <stage>in a supplicating tone</stage> I presume—I presume, Sir—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>What, Madam? what?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>I came, to request a favour of you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>So it should seem by that novel deportment.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>If you would for once consider with lenity, the frailty incidental to a woman who lives in the gay world—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Well, Madam!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>—How much she is led away by the temptation of fine cloaths, fine coaches, and fine things.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Come, to the business.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>You are rich we all know, though you endeavour to disguise the truth.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I can't stay to hear you, if you don't proceed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>My request is—save from the dreadful horrors of a jail, a woman who has no friend near her
<pb n="47" facs="52"/>
—a woman who may have inadvertently offended you, but who never—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>'Tis in vain for you to plead on her account—she knows my sentiments upon her conduct—she knows the opinion I have formed of her; and you cannot prevail on me to change it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Do you suppose I come to plead for Miss Dorrillon?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Certainly.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>No, I am pleading for myself. I am unfortunately involved in similar circumstances—I have a similar debt to the self-same tradesman, and we are both at present in the self-same predicament.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>And upon what pretence did you suppose I would be indulgent to you, move than to her?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Because you have always treated me with less severity; and because I overheard you just now say, you should glory in delivering from difficulty a good woman.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>And so I should.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>How unlike the world!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>No whatever the discontented may please to say, the world is affectionate, is generous, to the good; more especially to the good of the female sex; for it is only an exception to a general rule, when a good woman is in pecuniary distress.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Exit Sir</hi> William.</stage>
<stage><hi>Enter Lord</hi> Priory <hi>humming a tune, but with a very serious face: he pulls out his watch with evident marks of anxiety—coughs—rubs his forehead—and gives various other marks of discontent and agitation.</hi></stage>
<stage><hi>Lady</hi> Mary <hi>observes him with attention, then sidles up to him.</hi></stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>By the good humour you appear in, my Lord, I venture to mention to you my distresses. I know the virtues of Lady Priory make my failings conspicuous; but then consider the different modes to which we have been habituated—she excluded from temptation—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="48" facs="53"/>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>No—she shuns temptation. Has she not in this very house been compelled to make exertions? Has she not detected and exposed both Mr. Mandred and Mr. Bronzely?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Bronzely! Bronzely! How! <stage>Aside.</stage> Another rival?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>She has not done with <hi>him</hi> yet, I believe; for, to tell the truth, he is now with her at my house in Park-street. He taxed me with being jealous of my wife—to prove in what contempt I held the accusation, I left them together, and bid him make love to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Is that possible?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I can't say I would have done so rash an action, had I been married to some women—to you, for instance—but I have not a doubt of Lady Priory's safety: her mind, I know, is secure; and I have servants in the house to protect her from personal outrage. The only fear is, lest <hi>he</hi> should have received one; for it is now near two hours <stage>looking at his watch.</stage> since I came away, and I have neither seen nor heard any thing of either of them!—But to your Ladyship's concerns.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>I am this instant, my Lord, in the power of an implacable creditor; and without a friend who will give bond for a certain sum, I must—I blush to name it—be taken to a prison.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I am not at all surprised at the circumstance, Madam; but it amazes me that you should apply to me for deliverance. You have a brother in town; why not send to him?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>He was my friend the very last time a distress of this kind besell me. <stage>weeps.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Ask Mr. Norberry.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>He was my friend the time before.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Bronzely, then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>And Bronzely the time before that.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Oliver.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Oliver! I am glad to see you, my good fellow. Hah! what have you done with Mr. Bronzely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="49" facs="54"/>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>Nay, my Lord, that I can't tell. I can't tell what he has done with himself.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>How long has he been gone from my house?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>He is not gone yet as I know of; for none of the servants let him out.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Not gone! and you can't tell where he is!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>No, that we can't: we have looked in every room for him, and can't find him any where.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Not find him! <stage>recollecting himself.</stage> Ho! ho! I thought how it would be—I thought he'd have some trick played him. Where's your Lady?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>That I can't tell neither. We have looked in every room, and can't find <hi>her.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>How!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>'Tis as sure as I am alive. I and the butler, two footmen, and all the maids, have been looking in parlours, chambers and garrets, every crick and corner, and no where can we find either Mr. Bronzely or my Lady; but, wherever they are, there's no doubt but they are together. Ha, ha, ha, ha ha!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! No doubt at all. Mr. Oliver.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Together! together! and not in my house! You tell a falsehood. I'll go myself and find them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>You must look sharp, then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>How came you to miss them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>I chanced to go into the next room, to see if there was a proper fire to get it well aired; I know I had taken Mr. Bronzely to my Lady in the inner room, and I had heard them both laughing not a quarter of an hour before; but now, all on a sudden, there was neither laughing nor talking, nor any noise at all—every thing was so quiet, you might have heard a pin drop.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p><stage>anxiously.</stage> Well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<p>And so I thought to myself, thought I, I'll sit down here; for my Lady will be ringing soon: however, there was no ringing for a whole half-hour,
<pb n="50" facs="55"/>
and so then I thought I would e'en rap at the door; but nobody called "Come in." So then I went in of my own accord; and there I found—</p>

<p>Nobody! not a soul to be seen!</p>

<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Oh! she has been playing Bronzely some trick! She has been hiding him; and in some miserable place!</p>
</sp>

</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Mr. Norberry.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>My dear friend, my dear Lord Priory, let me speak with you alone.—I come upon business that—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>You look pale! What is your business? Tell it me at once.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>It is of so delicate a nature—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I know my wife is with Mr. Bronzely, I left them together. I know he is a licentious man; but I know she is an innocent woman.—Now, what have you to tell me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>What I have just learned from one of your servants. About a quarter of an hour after you left them, they stole softly out at the back of your house, ran to a post-chaise and four that was in waiting, and drove off together full speed.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Gone! eloped! run away from me! left me! left the tenderest, kindest, and most indulgent husband, that ever woman had!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>That we can all witness.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I was too fond of her—my affection ruined her—women are ungrateful—I did not exert a husband's authority—I was not strict enough—I humoured and spoiled her!—Bless me! what a thick mist is coming over my eyes!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>No, my Lord, it is clearing away.</p>

<p>And you avow that I did not come hither by the commands of my husband, but was deceived into that belief by you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Still it was by his commands your servant introduced me to you; and, upon an errand, which I feared to deliver till I arrived at a house of my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>What is the errand?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>To tell you that—I love you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>Do you assert, Lord Priory sent you to me for this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>I assert, that, in triumph at your betraying to him our private appointment, he gave me leave to have a second trial. If, then, you have ever harboured one wish to revenge, and forsake a churlish ungrateful partner, never return to him more—but remain with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="52" facs="57"/>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>And what shall I have gained by the exchange, when <hi>you</hi> become churlish, when <hi>you</hi> become ungrateful? My children's shame! the world's contempt! and yours! <stage>Smiling</stage> Come, come; you are but jesting, Mr. Bronzely! You would not affront my little share of common sense by making the serious offer of so bad a bargain▪ Come, own the jest, and take me home immediately.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Is it impossible for me to excite your tenderness?</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>Utterly impossible.</p>

<p>No—for <hi>your</hi> fears will protect me—I have no occasion for my own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>What have I to fear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>You fear to lounge no more at routs, at balls, at operas, in Bond-street; no more to dance in circles, chat in side boxes, or roar at taverns: for you have observed enough upon the events of life to know—that an atrocious offence like violence to a woman, never escapes condign punishment.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Can you wish to go back to the man who has made this trial of your fidelity, and not resent his conduct?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>Most assuredly I wish to return. But if you deliver me safe, perfectly safe from farther insult, it will be impossible for me not to shew resentment to Lord Priory.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Why only in that case?</p>
</sp>

<p>Because only in that case, you will make an impression on my heart—and I will resent his having exposed me to such a temptation.</p>

<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Miss Dorrillon <hi>and</hi> Mr. Norberry.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>You ought to have known it was in vain to send for me. Have not I repeatedly declared, that, till I heard from your father, you should receive nothing more from me than a bare subsistence? I promise to allow you thus much, even in this miserable place: but do not indulge a hope that I can release you from it. <stage>She weeps—he goes to the door—then returns.</stage> I forgot to mention, that Mr. Mandred goes on board to-morrow for India; and, little as you may think of his sensibility, he seems concerned at the thought of quitting England without just bidding you farewell. He came with me hither,—shall I send him up?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Oh! no: for heaven's sake! Deliver me from his asperity, as you would save me from distraction.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Nay, 'tis for the last time—you had better see him. You may be sorry, perhaps, you did not, when he is gone.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>No, no: I shan't be sorry.—Go, and excuse me—Go, and prevent his coming. I cannot see him. <stage><hi>Exit</hi> Mr. Norberry</stage> This would be aggravation of punishment, to shut me in a prison, and yet not shelter me from the insults of the world!</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Sir</hi> William.—She starts.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>—I know you have desired not to be troubled with my visit; and I come with all humility—I do not come, be assured, to reproach you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Unexpected mercy!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>No; though I have watched your course with anger, yet I do not behold its end with triumph.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>It is not to your honour, that you think it necessary to give this statement of your mind.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>May be—but I never boasted of perfection, though I can boast of grief that I am so far beneath it. I can boast too, that though I frequently give offence to others, I could never part
<pb n="55" facs="60"/>
with any one for ever (as I now shall with you,) without endeavouring to make some atonement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>You acknowledge, then, your cruelty to me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I acknowledge I have taken upon me to advise, beyond the liberty allowed by custom to one who has no apparent interest or authority.—But, not to repeat what has passed, I come, with the approbation of your friend Mr. Norberry, to make a proposal to you for the future. <stage>he draws chairs, and they sit.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>What proposal?—What is it?<stage>eagerly.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Norberry will not give either his money or his word to release you—But as I am rich—have lost my only child—and wish to do some good with my fortune, I will instantly lay down the money of which you are in want, upon certain conditions.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Do I hear right? Is it possible I can find a friend in <hi>you?</hi>—a friend to relieve me from the depth of misery! Oh Mr. Mandred!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Before you return thanks, hear the conditions on which I make the offer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Any conditions—What you please!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>You must promise, never, never to return to your former follies and extravagancies. <stage>She looks down.</stage> Do you hesitate? Do you refuse?—Won't you promise?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>I would, willingly—but for one reason.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>And what is that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>The fear, I should not keep my word.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>You will, if your fear be real.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>It <hi>is</hi> real—It is even so great, that I have no hope.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>You refuse my offer then, and dismiss me?<stage>Rises.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss. Dor.</speaker>
<p><stage>rising also.</stage> With much reluctance.—But I cannot, indeed I cannot make a promise, unless I were to feel my heart wholly subdued; and my mind entirely convinced that I should never break it.—Sir, I am most sincerely obliged to you for the
<pb n="56" facs="61"/>
good which I am sure you designed me; but do not tempt me with the proposal again—do not place me in a situation, that might add to all my other afflictions, the remorse of having deceived you.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>after a pause.</stage> Well, I will dispense with this condition—but there is another I must substitute in its stead.—Resolve to pass the remainder of your life, some few ensuing years at least, in the country. <stage>She starts.</stage> Do you start at that?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>I do not love the country. I am always miserable while I am from London. Besides, there are no follies or extravagancies in the country.—Dear Sir, this is giving me up the first condition, and then forcing me to keep it.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>There, Madam, <stage>taking out his pocketbook</stage> I scorn to hold out hopes, and then destroy them. There is a thousand pounds free of all conditions <stage>she takes it</stage>—extricate yourself from this situation, and be your own mistress to return to it when you please. <stage>Going.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Oh, my benefactor, bid me farewell at parting—do not leave me in anger.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>How! will you dictate terms to me, while you reject all mine?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Then only suffer me to express my gratitude—</p>

<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>I will not heat you. <stage>going.</stage></p>

<p>Then hear me on another subject: a subject of much importance—indeed it is.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>You are going to India immediately—It is possible that there, or at some place you will stop at on your way, you may meet with my father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Well!</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>You have heard that I have expected him home for some time past, and that I still live in hopes—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Well!— <stage>anxiously.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>If you should see him, and should be in his company—don't mention <hi>me.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Not mention <hi>you?</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="57" facs="62"/>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>At least, not my indiscretions—Oh! I should die, if I thought <hi>he</hi> would ever know of them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Do you think he would not discover them himself, should he ever see you?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>But he would not discover them all at once—I should be on my guard when he first came—My ill habits would steal on him progressively, and not be half so shocking, as if you were to vociferate them all in a breath.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>To put you out of apprehension at once—your father is not coming home—nor will he ever return to his own country.</p>

<p><stage>starting.</stage> You seem to speak from certain knowledge—Oh! heavens! is he not living?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>Yes, living—but under severe affliction—fortune has changed, and all his hopes are blasted.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>"Fortune changed!"—In poverty?—my father in poverty?— <stage>weeping.</stage>—Oh, Sir, excuse, what may perhaps appear an ill compliment to your bounty; but to me, the greatest reverence I can pay to it.—You are going to that part of the world where he is; take this precious gift back, search out my father, and let <hi>him</hi> be the object of your beneficence.— <stage>Forces it into his hand.</stage>—I shall be happy in this prison, indeed I shall, so I can but give a momentary relief to my dear, dear father.— <stage><hi>Sir</hi> William <hi>takes out his handkerchief.</hi></stage>—You weep!—This present, perhaps, would be but poor alleviation of his sufferings—perhaps he is in sickness; or a prisoner! Oh! if he is, release me instantly, and take me with you to the place of his confinement.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>What! quit the joys of London?</p>

<p>Hold, you may wish to break it.</p>

<p>No liberty at all, Sir George—at least no apology is necessary—I insist on hearing no excuses.

<stage><hi>Enter Mr.</hi> Norberry, <hi>Sir</hi> William, and <hi>Miss</hi> Dorrillon.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>My dear Lord Priory, exert your spirits to receive and congratulate a friend of mine. Sir William Dorrillon <stage>presenting him</stage> father to this young woman, whose failings he has endeavoured to correct under the borrowed name of Mandred.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>And with that fictitious name, I hope to disemburthen myself of the imputation of having ever offered an affront to my Lord Priory. <stage><hi>He takes Lord</hi> Priory <hi>aside, and they talk together.</hi></stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Sir</hi> George Evelyn.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible what I have heard is true? was it Mr. Mandred who has restored Miss Dorrillon to the protection of Mr. Norberry?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p><stage>coming forward.</stage> No, Sir George, I have now taken her under my own protection.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>By what title, Sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>A very tender one—don't be alarmed—I am her father.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>Sir William Dorrillon?<stage>They talk apart.</stage></p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter Lady</hi> Mary.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Has there been any intelligence of my Lady Priory yet? <stage><hi>sees Miss</hi> Dorrillon.</stage> My dear
<pb n="61" facs="66"/>
Dorrillon, a lover of yours has done the civilest thing by me!—As I live, here he is. How do you do, Sir George? I suppose you have all heard the news of Bronzely running away with—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Hush!—Lord Priory is here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Oh, he knows it—and it is not improper to remind him of it—it will teach him humility.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I <hi>am</hi> humble, Lady Mary, and own I have had a better opinion of your sex than I ought to have had.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>You mean, of your management of us; of your instructions, restrictions, and corrections.</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Servant.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Ser.</speaker>
<p>Lady Priory and Mr. Bronzely.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>What of them?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ser.</speaker>
<p>They are here.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I said she'd preserve her fidelity! Did not I always say so? Have I wavered once? Did I not always tell you all that she was only making game of Bronzely? Did I not tell you all so?</p>
</sp>
<stage><hi>Enter</hi> Bronzely <hi>and Lady</hi> Priory.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Then, indeed, my Lord, you said truly; for I return the arrantest blockhead—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I always said you would! But how is it? Where have you been? What occasion for a post-chaise? Instantly explain, or I shall forfeit that dignity of a husband to which, in those degenerate times, I have almost an exclusive right.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>To reinstate you, my Lord, in those honours, I accompany Lady Priory; and beg public pardon for the opinion I once publicly professed, of your want of influence over her affections.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Do you hear? Do you all hear? Lady Mary, do <hi>you</hi> hear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Taking advantage of your permission to call on her, by stratagem I induced her to quit your house, lest restraint might there act as my enemy.—But your authority, your prerogative, your honour
<pb n="62" facs="67"/>
attached to her under my roof. She has held those rights sacred, and compelled even <hi>me</hi> to revere them.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Do you all hear? I was sure it would turn out so!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>This is the first time I ever knew the gallant's word taken for a woman's honour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I will take her own word—the tongue which for eleven years has never in the slightest instance deceived me, I will believe upon all occasions. My dear wife, boldly pronounce before this company that you return to me with the same affection and respect, and the self-same contempt for this man— <stage><hi>to</hi> Bronzely</stage>—you ever had. <stage>A short pause.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>She makes no answer.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Hush! Hush! She is going to speak.— <stage>Another pause.</stage>—Why, why don't you speak?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>Because I am at a loss what to say.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Hear, hear, hear—do you all hear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Can you be at a loss to declare you hate Mr. Bronzely?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>I do <hi>not</hi> hate him.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>I was sure it would turn out so.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Can you be at a loss to say you love me?</p>
</sp>
<stage>She appears embarrassed.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>She <hi>is</hi> at at a loss.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>How! Don't you fear me?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>She speaks plainly to that question.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>You know I love truth—speak plainly to all their curiosity requires.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>Since you command it then, my Lord—I confess that Mr, Bronzely's conduct towards me has caused a kind of sentiment in my heart——</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Hah! What!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>You must believe her—"she has told you truth for eleven years."</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>A sensation which—</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Stop—any truth but this I could have borne.—Reflect on what you are saying—Consider what you are doing—Are these your primitive manners?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="63" facs="68"/>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>I should have continued those manners, had I known none but primitive men. But to preserve ancient austerity, while by my husband's consent, I am assailed by modern gallantry, would be the task of a Stoic, and not of his female slave.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Do you hear? Do you all hear? My Lord, do <hi>you</hi> hear?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>I do—I do—and though the sound distracts me, I cannot doubt her word.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>It gives me excessive joy to hear you say so, because you will not then doubt me when I add that gratitude, for his restoring me so soon to you, is the only sentiment he has inspired.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>Then my management of a wise is right after all!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
<p>Mr. Bronzely, as your present behaviour has in great measure atoned for your former actions, I will introduce to your acquaintance my friend Sir William Dorrillon.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p>Mandred, Sir William Dorrillon!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>And considering, Sir, that upon one or two occasions I have been honoured with your confidence—you will not be surprised, if the first command I lay upon my daughter, is—to take refuge from your pursuits, in the protection of Sir George Evelyn.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>And may I hope, Maria?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>No—I will instantly put an end to all your hopes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>How!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
<p>By raising you to the summit of your wishes, Alarmed at my severity, she has owned her readiness to become the subject of a milder government.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p>She shall never repine at the election she has made.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
<p>But, Sir George, if you are a prudent man, you will fix your eyes on my little domestic state, and guard against a rebellion.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady Pri.</speaker>
<p>Not the rigour of its laws has ever induced me to wish them abolished.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="64" facs="69"/>
<speaker>Bron.</speaker>
<p><stage>to Lady Pri.</stage> Dear Lady, you have made me think with reverence on the matrimonial compact—and I demand of you, Lady Mary—if, in consequence of former overtures, I should establish a legal authority over you, and become your chief magistrate—would you submit to the same controul to which Lady Priory submits.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
<p>Any controul, rather than have no chief magistrate at all.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
<p><stage>to Miss Dor.</stage> And what do you say to this?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss Dor.</speaker>
<p>Simply one sentence—A maid of the present day shall become a wife like those—of former times.</p>
</sp>
<stage>The scene closes—She comes forward.</stage>

<l>WELL, female critics, what's the sentence, say—</l>
<l>Can you with kindness treat this saucy play,</l>
<l>That gives to ancient dames the wreath of praise</l>
<l>And boldly censures those of modern days?</l>
<l>Bring up good husbands first, and, on my life,</l>
<l>For every one we'll shew as good a wife.</l>
<l>Whate'er the errors in the nuptial state,</l>
<l>Man sets th' example to his passive mate;</l>
<l>While all the virtues the proud sex can claim</l>
<l>From female influence caught the gen'rous flame.</l>
<l>Nay, though our gallant rulers of the main</l>
<l>With force resistless crush the pride of Spain</l>
<l>'Tis <hi>Woman</hi> triumphs—that inspiring charm</l>
<l>With tenfold vigour nerves the hero's arm:</l>
<l>For <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> though they nobly bleed,</l>
<l>The smile of <hi>Beauty</hi> is their dearest meed,</l>
